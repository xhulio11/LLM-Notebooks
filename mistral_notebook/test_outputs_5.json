    " Title: U.S. Economy Experiences Strongest Quarterly Growth Since 2003, Boosting Stock Market and Consumer Confidence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy is experiencing a significant surge, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) soaring 5% on an annual basis in the third quarter, according to data released by the government on Tuesday. This marks the strongest quarter of growth since 2003, signaling a robust economic recovery.\n\nInvestors responded positively to the news, sending the stock market to record highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing 18,000 for the first time ever. The growth was broad-based, with business investment, consumer spending, housing, exports, and government spending all showing signs of strength.\n\nConsumer spending, in particular, increased to a healthy pace of 3.2%, compared with previous estimates for 2.2%. With gas prices remaining low, many expect this trend to continue through the holiday season. \"Consumer spending north of 3% is pretty darn good these days,\" said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.\n\nDefense spending was also a significant driver in the third quarter, surging 16%. This growth represents the third and final reading on GDP, and the 5% figure is an upgrade from the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 3.9% growth.\n\nThe stellar third-quarter growth also marks an acceleration from the very strong growth of 4.6% during the second quarter and the rough first quarter when GDP was -2.1% due to harsh winter weather. This strong growth has contributed to a significant increase in hiring, with employers adding 321,000 jobs in November, making 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999.\n\nThe solid growth could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in 2015. While there is some trepidation about the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, it would signal that the U.S. economy is strong enough to move beyond the training wheels.\n\nThe American public appears to be taking notice of the flurry of positive economic headlines. For the first time in seven years, more than half of Americans think the economy is in good shape, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday. This marks a significant improvement from October when just 38% of Americans said economic conditions were somewhat or very good.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that new data released on Tuesday showed that orders of big-ticket items unexpectedly declined in November, suggesting businesses are hitting the brakes on investment. As a result, it's unlikely that the U.S. economy will maintain a growth rate of 5% for the remainder of 2014.",
    " Title: Gun-Rights Activists File Federal Lawsuit to Block Maryland's New Assault Weapons Law\n\nArticle:\n\nGun-rights activists in Maryland have initiated a federal lawsuit to challenge the state's newly enacted gun law, aiming to prevent the implementation of new requirements on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, set to take effect on October 1.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, the plaintiffs argue that the Second Amendment and case law protect their right to own assault rifles and magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. The Baltimore Sun reported that the plaintiffs include the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association, the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, and several other organizations, individuals, and gun shops.\n\nThe new Maryland law, passed earlier this year, bans 45 types of assault weapons, but those who currently own them will be allowed to keep them. The law also limits handgun magazines to 10 rounds and requires individuals to submit fingerprints to the state police to obtain a license to buy a handgun.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs plan to request a temporary injunction from a judge on Friday to halt the law's implementation, according to a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. A spokeswoman for Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, expects the law to withstand the group's legal challenge.\n\n\"The vast majority of Marylanders support these common-sense efforts to reduce gun violence,\" spokeswoman Samantha Kappalman told The Baltimore Sun. \"The new law will take effect on Tuesday, and it will make families safer.\"\n\nJohn Josselyn, legislative vice president of Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, stated that the restrictions are an \"unconstitutional violation\" of the Second Amendment rights of \"law-abiding, responsible citizens.\"\n\n\"Together we are drawing a line in the sand where Maryland's gun control agenda tramples the fundamental individual right to defend oneself and family in the home,\" Josselyn said.\n\nA spokesman for the Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore Inc., one of the plaintiffs, said the new laws would prevent honest citizens from choosing effective firearms for home defense.\n\nThe pending new law has led to a surge in firearm purchase applications, resulting in a backlog. In the last two weeks, state troopers reported receiving applications at a rate of 1,000 per day.\n\nMaryland State Police said Tuesday that residents who have submitted handgun purchase applications before the new requirements take effect next week will not need to obtain a handgun qualification license. The agency stated that troopers will not enforce the new requirements, which also include background checks and fingerprinting, on applications submitted by September 30.\n\nAs of Friday, slightly more than half of the over 100,000 purchase applications received had been processed, according to the agency. The agency began 24/7 operations in December to process the applications, but the backlog continued to grow.\n\nEarlier this month, state police said 20 law enforcement officers from other agencies began assisting with background investigations. State law requires that the investigations be conducted by police officers.\n\nState police also said that beginning last week, 24 data entry employees from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have been inputting information from applications. State police said several security measures were being taken to limit the access of DPSCS employees to the State Police database.",
    " Title: FBI Interrogates Las Vegas Shooting Suspect's Girlfriend, Reveals No Prior Knowledge of Attack\n\nLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - The girlfriend of the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history told the FBI on Wednesday that she had no prior knowledge of the attack, according to a statement read by her attorney. Marilou Danley, who is regarded by investigators as a \"person of interest,\" returned to the United States from a family visit to the Philippines on Tuesday.\n\nIn a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles, where the FBI was questioning her, Danley, 62, said, \"He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen.\"\n\nThe carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while Danley was abroad left 58 people dead and nearly 500 injured when he opened fire on an outdoor concert from his 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday night. Paddock took his own life before police stormed his room, bringing the total death toll to 59.\n\nPolice recovered nearly 50 firearms from three locations they searched, nearly half of them from the hotel suite. Twelve of the rifles there were fitted with so-called bump stocks, officials said, allowing the guns to be fired almost as though they were automatic weapons.\n\nClark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters he found it hard to believe that the arsenal of weapons, ammunition, and explosives recovered by police in their investigation could have been assembled by Paddock completely on his own. \"You have to make an assumption that he had some help at some point,\" Lombardo said at a news briefing.\n\nLombardo said the attack was the obvious outcome of meticulous planning. \"What we know is that Stephen Paddock is a man who spent decades acquiring weapons and ammo and living a secret life, much of which will never be fully understood,\" the sheriff said.\n\nIn response to a question, Lombardo said investigators were examining the possibility Paddock's purchase of more than 30 guns in October 2016 may have been precipitated by some triggering event in his life. He did not elaborate.\n\nIf Paddock did have any accomplice, there remained no evidence as yet \"to indicate terrorism\" in the shooting spree, said Aaron Rouse, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office.\n\nEarlier in the day, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas, marking the first time since taking office that he has had to confront a major mass shooting.\n\nIn her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles, Paddock's girlfriend Danley insisted she knew Paddock as \"a kind, caring, quiet man.\" \"It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,\" she said. Her lawyer, Matt Lombard, said Danley was \"fully cooperating\" with the investigation.\n\nDanley, an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage, said she flew back to the United States voluntarily \"because I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.\"\n\nDanley, who was twice married before her relationship with Paddock, became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas, before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September.\n\nFBI agents met her plane at Los Angeles International Airport before interviewing her, two U.S. officials briefed on the case told Reuters. As of midday Wednesday, there was no indication she was aware of Paddock's plans, they said.\n\nInvestigators questioned her about Paddock's weapons purchases, a $100,000 wire transfer to a Philippine bank that appeared to be intended for her, and whether she saw any changes in his behavior before she left the United States.\n\n\"Assuming she had no role in his actions, the most important thing is any light she can shed on Paddock's motive,\" said one official, who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity.\n\nDanley said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there, leading her to worry he might be planning to break up with her.\n\nPaddock's brother Eric told reporters the $100,000 transfer was evidence that \"Steve took care of the people he loved,\" and that he likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack.\n\nShe arrived in Manila on Sept. 15, flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22, returned to Manila on Sept. 25 and was there until she flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday night, according to a Philippine immigration official.\n\nDiscerning Paddock's motive has proven especially baffling given the absence of the indicators typical in other mass shootings. He had no criminal record, no known history of mental illness, and no outward signs of social disaffection, political discontent, or extremist ideology, police said.\n\nTrump, touring a hospital in Las Vegas, told reporters Paddock was \"very demented,\" and he asked Lombardo if investigators were any closer to establishing a motive.\n\n\"We've had a couple good leads and we're working our way through it,\" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told the president.

    " Title: Biden Campaign Outraises Trump's in Second Consecutive Month Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development less than four months before the presidential election, the campaigns of President Donald Trump and his challenger, Joe Biden, have announced their fundraising totals for the three months ending June 30. The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have raised a combined total of $282 million during the last quarter and $141 million in June, surpassing Trump's totals. This marks the second month in a row that Biden has outraised Trump's campaign.\n\nTrump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee announced Wednesday evening that they had raised $266 million for the same period, including $131 million in June alone. This is an unusual occurrence, as it is highly uncommon for a challenger's campaign to raise more money than an incumbent president's.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, Biden's campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters, \"It's clear that voters are looking for steady leadership, experience, empathy, compassion, and character \u2014 and they'll find all of these qualities in Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\nWhile Biden has conducted frequent fundraisers with high-dollar donors, his campaign has emphasized its success in growing its list of small donors, with the average online donation last month being $34.\n\nThe Trump campaign is boasting its substantial cash-on-hand war chest, now totaling $295 million, largely due to the head start Trump had by launching his campaign and fundraising efforts as soon as he was sworn in. Jack Oliver, campaign fundraising co-chair, stated, \"I'd rather be in our position than theirs.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has yet to disclose its current funds, with full numbers to be available no later than July 20.\n\nBiden's fundraising surge comes as national and state polls show the president trailing behind the former vice president. This trend is partly attributed to the Trump administration's response to the pandemic and protests against racial injustice.\n\nWhile Trump's campaign vowed this year it would aim to flip several states won by Democrats in the past, its spending shows it is focusing entirely on holding onto states that Trump won in 2016, including some that appeared safe for the president until recently.\n\nThe ad-buying firm Medium Buying reported Tuesday that the Trump campaign had reserved nearly $100 million worth of ad time this fall in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The campaign is also buying ads in Georgia, Michigan, and Iowa. Trump won all of those states in 2016, some by comfortable margins.\n\nThe most recent analysis of the Electoral College battleground from NPR showed that neither candidate appears to have the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency in hand, but Biden is closer with at least one state Trump previously won \u2014 Michigan \u2014 leaning his way, while the president has failed to make progress in states that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Delays Vote on Impeachment Proceedings Against President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Tuesday evening that the lower chamber will postpone a formal vote on whether to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. During a meeting with the House Democratic caucus, Pelosi stated, \"There's no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote.\" She further emphasized, \"We're not here to call bluffs \u2014 we're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News, sources privy to the closed-door discussions suggest that Democrats are reluctant to appear as if they are yielding to the Trump administration's demands, following the White House's refusal last week to cooperate with the ongoing impeachment probe due to the lack of a floor vote authorizing the proceedings.\n\nIn an 8-page letter to Pelosi and other top Democrats, Counsel to the President Pat Cipollone wrote, \"In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized House Democrats for abandoning due process in a speech from the Senate floor earlier in the day. McConnell stated, \"House Democrats are finally indulging in their three-year-old impeachment obsession, full steam ahead.\" He went on to remind his colleagues that some Democrats had declared their plans to impeach President Trump before he was even inaugurated.\n\nMcConnell continued, \"I don't think many of us were expecting to witness a clinic in terms of fairness or due process, but even by their own partisan standards, House Democrats have already found new ways to lower the bar.\" He added, \"For all the public hyperventilating over institutional norms that we've heard from House Democrats, it appears they have no intention of letting norms, precedents, or basic due process stand in the way as they seek to cancel out a presidency.\"",
    " Title: China's November Exports and Imports Show Slower Global and Domestic Demand, Raising Concerns for Growth Rate\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's November exports and imports data, released on Saturday, showed a significant slowdown compared to previous months, indicating weaker global and domestic demand. The exports growth rate of 5.4 percent year-on-year is the weakest since a 3 percent contraction in March, and falls short of the 10 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nThe customs data revealed that the growth of exports to China's major trading partners slowed significantly. Exports to the United States rose 9.8 percent in November, compared with 13.2 percent in October, while exports to the European Union increased by 6.0 percent, compared with 14.6 percent in October. Exports to South Korea fell year-on-year, contrasting with a 7.7 percent rise in October.\n\nImport growth was 3 percent, the slowest since October 2016, and significantly lower than the 14.5 percent seen in the poll. Imports of iron ore fell for a second consecutive month, reflecting waning restocking demand at steel-mills as profit margins narrow.\n\nWang Jun, chief economist of Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing, commented, \"The sluggishness in imports and exports is in full swing.\" He added, \"The soft imports show a relatively significant pullback in domestic demand.\"\n\nIn recent months, Chinese exports had expanded robustly, which economists attributed to front-loading of cargoes before the now-postponed plan to hike U.S. tariffs of $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on January 1. The November trade numbers came out less than a week after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce, delaying that tariff hike as they negotiate a trade deal.\n\nStirring fears of a reignition of trade tension, the daughter of Huawei Technologies' founder, a top executive at the Chinese technology giant, was arrested in Canada on December 1 and faces extradition to the United States, threatening to drive a wedge between the U.S. and China.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, on Friday, sounded an optimistic note about trade negotiations with China as his top economic advisers downplayed friction from the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. \"China talks are going very well,\" Trump said on Twitter, without providing any details.\n\nAnalysts at Haitong Securities in Shanghai noted, \"Growth in shipments of Chinese goods on U.S. 200 billion tariff list has started to pull back, indicating that front-loading effects may be starting to recede.\" They added, \"Now with U.S. and China agreeing not to escalate trade tensions any longer, China will start purchasing U.S. agricultural goods, which may narrow China-U.S. trade surplus in the future.\"\n\nChina's November trade surplus with the United States was a record $35.55 billion. The October surplus was $31.78 billion. But China's imports from the U.S. in November fell 25 percent year-on-year, while the annual decline in October was only 1.8 percent. For trade with all countries, China's surplus was $44.74 billion for November, compared with forecasts of $34 billion and October's surplus of $34.02 billion.\n\nEconomists say one factor helping keep up Chinese exports this year is that the yuan has weakened more than 5 percent against the dollar, helping to make Chinese products more competitive abroad. Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office of brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said the weaker yuan \"should boost industrial exports over the coming months.\"\n\nEconomists in recent months have penciled in a deterioration in China's export outlook in 2019, factoring in higher U.S. tariffs on a wider range of Chinese goods. Chinese policymakers are expected to offer more policy support and deliver more support measures if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate. China's central bank has cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves four times this year, as policymakers seek to steady the slowing economy amid the trade war with the United States. The government aims for growth of around 6.5 percent this year, compared with 2017's 6.9 percent pace.\n\nYang Yewei, an analyst at Southwest Securities in Beijing, said, \"As global demand cools, 'domestic growth-boosting measures should be more effective.'\"",
    " Title: Constitutional Moment: The Shift in Power and the Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of constitutional law, a theory proposed by Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman, known as \"constitutional moments,\" is gaining traction. Ackerman's theory suggests that constitutions can change not only through formal amendments but also when prominent political actors act contrary to the existing constitution, and their actions are accepted and validated by the people, thereby establishing a new constitutional norm.\n\nThis theory, while not universally accepted by originalists who believe in the Article V process of amendments, has been applied to the current political climate in the United States. We are currently experiencing a constitutional moment, as defined by Harvard Law School constitutional law professor Noah Feldman in an op-ed titled \"Trump's firing of Comey is a crisis of American rule of law.\"\n\nFeldman argues that President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, while technically within his constitutional rights, eroded the independence of law enforcement and violated the unwritten constitutional norm of political neutrality. This norm, Feldman suggests, may be more important than the traditional power of democratically elected politicians to supervise and fire officials in the executive branch.\n\nThe career bureaucracy, often referred to as the \"administrative state,\" has developed a powerful norm that certain matters should be left to their control. Temporary occupants of political office who offend careerists at their peril face consequences, as seen in the case of former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who was forced from office due to a series of ethical lapses leaked by career staff who did not approve of his policies.\n\nThe current constitutional moment raises questions about who is truly running the country: the elected president or the career bureaucracy? This question was echoed by Chuck Schumer's warning to an incoming President Trump, a Washington outsider, about offending the intelligence community. The game plan for the new constitutional order was laid out by James Comey in his testimony to Congress following his firing, calling for the removal of a president for inappropriate reasons to be considered an impeachable offense.\n\nThe future of our constitutional system hangs in the balance. If we start removing presidents from office for actions that are within their official powers but with motives that the opposition considers inappropriate, we may be moving towards a constitutional moment of fundamental significance. The United States has been defined by a powerful elected president. However, the current administration's approach to the career bureaucracy may signal a shift towards a system more akin to the European Union or the United Kingdom, where the career experts in the executive branch hold the real power. Stay tuned; the future of our constitutional system is uncertain.",
    " Title: San Bernardino Explores Legalizing Medical Marijuana to Address Revenue and Enforcement Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address financial constraints and illegal marijuana operations, the city of San Bernardino, California, is considering the legalization of medical marijuana and the subsequent taxation of its sale. The idea, which was spurred by concerns about the proliferation of unregulated medical marijuana dealers, could potentially bring millions of dollars into the city's coffers each year.\n\nCity Attorney Gary Saenz revealed that a legislative review panel has been established by the City Council to study the idea. This panel is gathering data, consulting with the city police department, and examining laws in other jurisdictions before presenting a proposal to the full committee. The panel plans to hold at least two more public meetings on the subject through August.\n\nSaenz emphasized that the city is in the exploratory phase, with the primary objective being to close down illegal marijuana dispensaries. He reported as many as 20 illegal storefronts in the city at any given time. Legalizing and regulating the industry, he believes, is a tool to help the city take control of the situation.\n\nCity Council member James Mulvihill expressed his support for the idea, citing the high cost of pursuing illegal dealers. He suggested that any funds generated from the regulation and tax of marijuana dispensaries would be used exclusively for enforcement.\n\nMayor R. Carey Davis, according to Michael McKinney, the mayor's chief of staff, is open to exploring various options to combat the current problems. McKinney stated that while Davis prefers not to see any marijuana dispensaries in San Bernardino, he is listening to all the options.\n\nMcKinney also mentioned that his office has been receiving calls advocating both sides of the issue. Saenz clarified that the idea is not a newfound embrace of marijuana but rather a pragmatic approach to dealing with the current problems.\n\nSan Bernardino, with a population of 209,924, filed for bankruptcy in 2012, making it the largest city in the U.S. to do so. Mulvihill emphasized that his support for the dispensaries is narrow, stating, \"I'm doing this because of the trouble we're in -- we can't control it.\"\n\nThe city has maintained an outright ban on pot shops since medical marijuana was made legal through a ballot referendum in 1996. Last year, the state Supreme Court in San Francisco unanimously ruled that local jurisdictions have the authority to prohibit medical marijuana despite its legality at the state level.",
    " Title: Cuba in Mourning: Reflections on Fidel Castro's Legacy in 2016\n\nIn the heart of Havana, the capital city of Cuba, a palpable silence has descended, marking the first days without the presence of Fidel Castro, the longtime dictator who passed away last Friday. NPR's Carrie Kahn, reporting from Havana, describes the unusual quietness that has enveloped the city, with streets usually bustling with life now eerily empty.\n\n\"It's quite unusual here in Havana,\" Kahn says. \"Usually on a Saturday or Sunday night, there's tons of people out in the street all along the iconic sea wall, the Malecon, listening to music, talking, drinking. There's none of that now. There's nobody out celebrating. Bars are closed. Discotheques are closed. There's no alcohol being sold in many restaurants. It's a very subdued scene here.\"\n\nFidel Castro, who officially stepped down in 2008, passing the presidency to his brother Raul, maintained a significant influence over the Cuban people even after his retirement. Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother, has been in power for at least a decade, but the absence of Fidel is being felt acutely.\n\n\"Fidel was really out of the limelight a lot,\" Kahn explains. \"But in 2016, we heard from Fidel two times. One was right after the historic visit that President Obama made here in March to Cuba. Fidel came out and condemned the United States. He had to make a few negative statements, saying - about Obama's visit, stating he was not in accordance with this opening and the warming of relations.\"\n\nThe second time was during the Cuban Communist Party's once-every-five-years Congress, where Fidel made a public appearance, looking frail and weak. He praised communism and criticized the United States, but his public appearances were few and far between.\n\nKahn, who has visited Cuba numerous times since the opening in 2014, shares her observations on the mixed emotions Cubans have expressed regarding Fidel Castro. \"From older people in this apartment building that I'm staying in right now, they have a - a little shrine with candles lit in the lobby and pictures of Fidel and they are taking turns standing watch over their shrine, and people are saying that they're in pain. But then I went to parks, where there are few people out, and one man who - I think he was in his 60s - was telling me just how he's glad that he's gone and he was a dictator and now they're hoping for more change to happen.\"\n\nThe question remains whether Fidel's absence will lead to significant changes in Cuba. While Raul Castro has been the driving force behind economic reforms and the warming of relations with the United States, there have been fits and starts in the opening process. The Cuban government has been known to make things more difficult for small businesspeople, leading some to speculate that Fidel was the one putting the brakes on economic reforms and the opening.\n\n\"We'll just have to see if that was the truth,\" Kahn concludes. \"Nobody knows in this opaque, very secretive government here.\" The future of Cuba without Fidel Castro remains uncertain, with political openings few and far between.",
    " Title: Macron Urges U.S. to Maintain Global Engagement in Address to Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, praising the United States for its global leadership but also urging caution in the face of various threats. In his speech, Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining an open and engaged approach to global issues, rather than retreating into isolationism.\n\nDuring his address, Macron highlighted the strong relationship between France and the United States, noting the shared history and values that have bound the two nations together since their inception. He praised the \"miracle relationship\" between the two countries, citing their joint efforts in promoting liberty, tolerance, and equal rights.\n\nMacron's visit, which marked the first official state visit by a foreign leader during the Trump administration, has been marked by pomp and ceremony, including a state dinner, a tour of monuments, and a review of U.S. troops. The French president and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have been feted by the Trumps throughout their stay in Washington.\n\nIn his speech, Macron addressed several contentious issues, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. On the Iran deal, Macron called for a diplomatic solution, stating that France's objective is to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. However, he also expressed a desire to avoid abandoning the deal prematurely, suggesting that a more substantial alternative should be developed first.\n\nRegarding the Paris climate agreement, Macron urged the United States to rejoin the accord, expressing confidence that the U.S. would eventually return to the agreement. He also made a direct reference to President Trump's campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again,\" stating that the two nations should work together to make the planet great again while creating new jobs and safeguarding the environment.\n\nMacron also addressed the issue of terrorism, noting the shared efforts between the United States and France in combating extremism. He lamented the multiple attacks in both countries over the past five years, which he described as a \"horrific price to pay for freedom and democracy.\"\n\nIn addition, Macron took aim at the scourge of \"fake news,\" warning that the dissemination of lies online threatens freedoms worldwide. He emphasized the importance of reason and truth in maintaining the spirit of democracy and combating the corruption of information.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted before the address, expressing his anticipation for Macron's speech. The speech coincided with the 58th anniversary of a Washington address by then-French President Charles de Gaulle.",
    " Title: The Implications of Trump's Middle East Policy: A New Era Emerging?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, the actions and rhetoric of the current U.S. administration under President Donald Trump are causing ripples of uncertainty and apprehension among traditional American allies. The recent attacks in the region have brought into focus the potential consequences of the U.S.'s shifting foreign policy stance, particularly in relation to Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe fear among Iran's leaders, as noted by Omid Memarian of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, is a resurgence of the Green Movement, a grassroots political movement that emerged following the disputed presidential election in 2009. The Iranian authorities' harsh crackdown on human rights lawyers, according to Memarian, is a reflection of their fear of exposure and a desire to evade accountability.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to human rights issues, or lack thereof, has complicated efforts to support movements like the Green Movement. The indifference towards human rights, coupled with Trump's rhetoric and policy towards migrants, has raised concerns about the future of American values and their strategic implications.\n\nMoreover, Trump's expressed willingness to support Saudi Arabia, even in the face of human rights abuses, and his seeming deference to Saudi direction in responding to recent attacks, has some observers questioning the beginning of the end of the American era in the Middle East. Trump's desire to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan, his reluctance to re-establish deterrence with Iran through limited military reprisals, and his general skepticism regarding America's role in policing the global commons, are all moves that could potentially benefit Iran.\n\nThe potential vulnerability of Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is a concern. With a military budget of $68 billion, Saudi Arabia's self-defense capabilities are questionable, and the U.S.'s reluctance to defend it could leave the region open to further instability. The presence of a large and unhappy Shiite minority in eastern Saudi Arabia is a potential flashpoint, and the absence of U.S. protection could embolden Iran to take advantage of the situation.\n\nAs Robert O'Brien assumes the role of Trump's national security adviser, the U.S.'s response to unprovoked attacks on the global economy's central pillars will be a test of American leadership. The potential consequences of failure will be felt for years to come. The future of the Middle East hangs in the balance, and the world watches with bated breath.",
    " Title: Obama and Congressional Republicans Differ in Lessons Learned from Fiscal Cliff Deal as Budget Deadlines Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States faces a series of budget deadlines in the coming months, President Obama and congressional Republicans have divergent views on the lessons learned from the deal that averted the \"fiscal cliff.\" The agreement, which included a tax increase for the first time in 20 years, has set a precedent for future deficit reduction and federal spending negotiations, according to President Obama.\n\nSpeaking after the deal, Mr. Obama stated, \"The deficit needs to be reduced in a way that\u2019s balanced. Everyone pays their fair share.\" He emphasized that future agreements must achieve balance by requiring wealthier individuals or corporations to pay more taxes.\n\nHowever, many Republicans argue that the agreement this week gave President Obama all the tax increases he will ever get, and future negotiations should focus on spending cuts. Some Republicans, such as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, have suggested they are willing to force a government shutdown to make their point in negotiations over raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\nThe upcoming budget deadlines include a postponement of steep, automatic spending cuts until March 1, giving the White House and Congress less than two months to agree on an alternative solution to reduce deficits. This fiscal deadline will be followed by another on March 31, when temporary legislation to keep the government running is set to expire. The most contentious question looming over these deadlines is the issue of raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling of $16.4 trillion.\n\nThe government has technically reached its borrowing limit, but the Treasury Department is taking steps to postpone the day of reckoning until late February or early March. After that, the government would start defaulting on its debts, a scenario that President Obama described as \"catastrophic\" for the global economy.\n\nPresident Obama has stated that his protracted feud with Republican leaders over raising the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011 hurt the economy. He warned, \"The last time this course of action was threatened, our entire recovery was put at risk. Consumer confidence plunged. Business investment plunged. Growth dropped. We can\u2019t go down that path again.\"\n\nAs for the president\u2019s argument for more revenue, Republicans argue that this week\u2019s agreement has ended the question of taxes. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated, \"We can and will pursue comprehensive tax reform this year, in 2013, and next steps. We need to address the fundamental driver of our deficits and debt, and that is out-of-control spending.\"\n\nBoth sides dispute the extent to which the fiscal cliff bill accomplishes its goals. While President Obama is hailing it as a deficit-reduction measure, the agreement would boost the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with a scenario in which Congress did nothing. Democrats argue that the legislation will lower deficits by about $600 billion over 10 years compared with current policy, as doing nothing was never a realistic option. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office states that the bill will increase spending over the next decade by about $330 billion.",
    " Title: Uncertain Voters in Florida's Hillsborough County Navigate Political and Economic Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, Morning Edition has embarked on a series of reports from an iconic American corner: First and Main. Over the next few months, the series will travel to battleground states, focusing on vital counties in each state. In Hillsborough County, Florida, the journey began at the intersection of politics and real life, the corner of First and Main in a suburban town.\n\nThe visit took us across the county, meeting residents of trailer parks, members of a historic church, owners of a fruit stand, and more. Our final stop was at the end of a Tampa cul-de-sac, where Wanda Kos stepped out into her garage.\n\nKos, the daughter of Costa Rican immigrants, is a stay-at-home mom in the area known as New Tampa, where suburban-style developments stretch out for miles. The neighborhood boasts stone countertops, high ceilings, and lush Florida palm trees in the yards.\n\n\"It looks beautiful, but we have issues,\" Kos says. \"I mean, there's issues in every single place you see in here.\"\n\nThis neighborhood experienced a significant real estate market boom and bust during the financial crisis. \"Things feel like they're finally kind of settling in,\" she says. \"People, you know, kind of took their losses and started making do with what they had. A lot of people did lose their houses.\"\n\nLike many others, Kos has looked up the value of her home. \"Because we move around, we know we have another move. We know we're going to lose some more money,\" she says. \"So it's kind of tough.\"\n\nThe neighborhood has seen a rise in rental properties, with many homes being rented out instead of sold. \"Lot of houses are rentals now,\" Kos says. \"Couldn't sell the houses so they started renting them. We do not know who they're letting in.\"\n\nIn the last election, Kos voted for President Obama. She expresses a mix of support and criticism for the president, stating that she is undecided about her choice in the upcoming election. \"I tend to understand when you try really hard, but there's just so much you can do,\" she says.\n\nOn social issues, she aligns with the president. However, she has reservations about Obamacare and found herself in a heated argument on Facebook over the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain's stance on gay marriage.\n\nKos identifies as an undecided voter, a status that, according to surveys, makes her one of the nation's few. She expresses a negative initial impression of the Republican alternative, Mitt Romney, but plans to discuss her decision with her husband, just as they did four years ago.\n\nKos's decision will be an emotional one this time around, as her 20-year-old son is set to join the Army and leave for basic training on September 11. \"It's scary,\" she says. \"He's going to leave for basic training Sept. 11. Not Sept. 10, not Sept. 12, Sept. 11.\"\n\nWith her daughter Sofia by her side, Kos returns to cleaning the paint out of the garage, reflecting on her life and the choices she will make in the upcoming election. \"So that's my life,\" she says with a laugh. \"You guys got me in a nutshell.\"",
    " Title: USWNT Lawsuit Against U.S. Soccer Federation: A Timeline and Analysis of the Gender Discrimination Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the adjustments it has brought about, a significant development in the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) may have gone unnoticed. The team filed a gender-discrimination lawsuit against the USSF in March 2019, gaining international attention following their dominant victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup.\n\nHere's a quick timeline of the current lawsuit, according to reporting by ESPN:\n\n- March 2019: The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n- July 2019: USSF president Carlos Cordeiro released an open letter, citing what he described as extensive analysis of 10 years of financial data. He said the data showed that from 2010 to 2018, the women's players were paid $34.1 million in salary and game bonuses by U.S. Soccer, compared to $26.4 million given to the men during the same time period. The men's and women's teams operate with separate collective bargaining agreements and pay structures.\n- Nov 2019: Federal judge R. Gary Klausner of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the USWNT's motion to give its lawsuit class certification. The early win for the women meant the lawsuit could include players who appeared for the national team dating back to Feb. 4, 2015. U.S. Soccer had opposed the motion for certification.\n- Feb 2020: In February, the two sides filed very different motions in district court. Lawyers for the USWNT filed for partial summary judgment seeking back pay of at least $66.7 million in addition to punitive damages. USSF asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit \"based on the actual facts in the record and the governing law.\"\n- March 2020: The federation reversed course on the most contentious of its arguments. Cordeiro resigned on March 12 amid backlash from fans and sponsors to language in court filings attempting to show women's players did not perform work of equal skill, effort, and responsibility. Both Cordeiro and new USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone apologized for the language widely viewed as demeaning women's players and women's sports generally.\n- May 2020: The trial was originally slated to begin on May 5 but was pushed back to June 16 after both sides sought guidance from the court in light of the coronavirus outbreak. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has issued a stay-at-home order in his state because of the global pandemic. U.S. Soccer publicly apologized for and legally walked back its most hard-line arguments. Indeed, it earned a fairly resounding win on the motion for summary judgment by focusing not on the idea that the women's players did not perform equal work but that the differences in CBAs did not constitute discrimination but fair trade-offs willingly negotiated.\n\nSupporters of the lawsuit argue that the women's team has actually been paid less than the men's team when analyzing total compensation and tournament payouts, as these are dictated by viewership and popularity. Opponents argue that the women's team has actually been paid more than the men's team in the last decade when analyzing total compensation and tournament payouts. The trial is set to begin on June 16, 2020.",
    " Title: North Carolina's 9th Congressional District: State Board of Elections Orders New Election Following Absentee Ballot Fraud Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the North Carolina State Board of Elections has ordered a new election for the 9th Congressional District, following months of investigation into an absentee ballot scheme linked to the campaign of Republican Mark Harris. The decision comes after a four-day hearing during which dramatic testimony was presented about the fraud allegations that have left the seat vacant in the new Congress.\n\nThe results of the November 6th election, which showed Mr. Harris leading Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes, have been in limbo due to the fraud allegations. The board was tasked with reviewing the evidence and deciding whether to certify the November 6th results or order a new election in the district, which spans the area between Charlotte and Fayetteville.\n\nChairman Bob Cordle stated before the vote that the \"illegal activity\" uncovered had \"tainted the results of the entire election.\" He added, \"I believe the people of North Carolina deserve a fair election and deserve to have their votes counted properly.\"\n\nIt is rare for a state to call a new election to resolve a disputed House race. The last time was in the 1974 election for Louisiana's 6th Congressional District, when a malfunctioning voting machine caused a disputed outcome, and a state court ordered a new election.\n\nMr. Harris initially fought to have his November 6th win certified, including mounting a court challenge. However, he abruptly reversed course at Thursday's hearing, stating that he had a change of heart and that he struggled with recall and confusion during the hearing. Mr. Harris also announced that he was hospitalized last month with a severe infection and suffered two strokes.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Mr. Harris maintained that neither he nor leaders of his campaign knew about the scheme to \"harvest\" absentee ballots, which is illegal in North Carolina. The scheme was allegedly orchestrated by political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, who refused to testify at the hearings.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes and North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin issued statements following the decision. Mr. Hayes stated, \"We will continue to work with legislators and investigators on how we can improve the electoral system so that these kinds of situations can be avoided in the future.\" Mr. Goodwin stated, \"North Carolina Republicans, following Mark Harris' lead, repeatedly lied to the people of the 9th District, silenced their voices, and undermined our entire state's faith in our democracy.\"\n\nKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, cheered the decision for the new election. She stated, \"The lesson that all Americans should take from this is that ballot fraud and voter suppression remain rampant in our country and stand as grave threats to our democracy.\"\n\nThe board will set the date of the election at a future meeting. Election Director Kim Strach has called the scheme a \"coordinated, unlawful, and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme.\" As he planned his 2018 run, Mr. Harris said he was introduced to Mr. Dowless as a \"good ol' boy\" who \"eats, lived, slept, and drank politics.\" Mr. Dowless had a reputation for running an aggressive and proven operation to boost turnout and absentee ballot voting.",
    " Title: Defense Teams for Menendez and Melgen Accuse Justice Department of 'Fixation on Sex and Salacious Headlines'\n\nIn a recent court filing, lawyers for Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and his wealthy donor, Salomon Melgen, have accused the Justice Department of having a \"fixation on sex and salacious headlines\" in the ongoing bribery and fraud case against them. The defense teams have reiterated their call for a court to dismiss the charges, taking aim at the government's contention that they had uncovered \"corroboration\" for claims of consorting with prostitutes in luxury homes in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe defense lawyers have argued that no witness or document, throughout the entire investigation, has ever accused Senator Menendez of being in the presence of a prostitute, much less engaged in relations with one. They also contend that the FBI mischaracterized a black notebook found at Melgen's office as a \"prostitution ledger.\" The notebook, according to the defense, was filled with innocent material, including family, friends, business contacts, and religious prayers.\n\nThe defense lawyers further claim that the FBI mistook jottings about \"Dixi\" to mean a prostitute, when it was instead the name of a sanitation company in the Dominican Republic. They argue that it is absurd to believe someone would solicit prostitutes using a 168-page handwritten notebook.\n\nThe court filings by the defense team foreshadow what could be a heated argument next week in a federal courthouse in New Jersey. The lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have accused the government of \"serious misconduct,\" including media leaks, a preoccupation with the defendants' sex lives, and misstating facts to the grand jury that indicted the men.\n\nLast month, public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department said it was the defendants who were twisting the facts. Lawyer Peter Koski said authorities had conducted \"an exhaustive, focused, and disciplined investigation\" that produced a 22-count criminal indictment against the long-serving senator from New Jersey and his wealthy friend of about two decades. The indictment alleges that Melgen paid for travel and housing for Menendez in exchange for a series of favors from the lawmaker.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Walls has already refused defense requests to move the trial out of New Jersey. On Sept. 17, he will hear both sides argue a series of incendiary motions about critical pieces of evidence and the way authorities gathered information and presented it to grand jurors. The case is scheduled for trial in November, but either side may seek to appeal, perhaps delaying the trial into an election year. The case's outcome could hinge on whether Menendez is charged with crimes, in part, for actions he took in the course of his public service, protected under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause.\"\n\nRandall Eliason, a former prosecutor who now teaches at George Washington Law School, said in a blog post this week the case is \"shaping up as a clash that will have all the quiet gentility of a New Jersey mob war.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Proposes $2 Trillion Infrastructure Bill as Fourth Phase of Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a $2 trillion infrastructure bill as the fourth phase of the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. This comes just days after Congress approved a massive stimulus package worth over $2.2 trillion.\n\nThe President tweeted, \"With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades-long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4.\"\n\nTrump has long sought a major infrastructure bill, and this appears to be a renewed push for his plan as an economic stimulus measure. The president's tweet comes as lawmakers in both the House and the Senate are already considering a fourth coronavirus response bill, though some have expressed caution about continuing to appropriate such large sums of money.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently stated, \"I think the odds are we'll need more legislation. First, we don't know the extent of the crisis in terms of the magnitude, so that could rise. But there are going to be problems that we don't realize now that we'll have to grapple with,\" according to The Hill. \"So I think the odds are high there will be a COVID-4.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also expressed the need for further legislation, telling CNN that Democrats \"had bigger direct payments in our bill, and we think we'll get more direct payments in another bill.\"\n\nIn a fourth stimulus package, Democrats are reportedly seeking additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, as well as emissions restrictions on airlines\u2014a measure that was blocked from inclusion in the package passed last week. Pelosi also plans to push for pension protections, which did not make it into phase three of the stimulus package.\n\nHowever, Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, have said they would like to see the impact of the first three phases of coronavirus response legislation before considering another bill.\n\nThe 880-page coronavirus stimulus package, worth $2.2 trillion and passed and signed into law by Trump last Friday, is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. The bill provides massive aid to individuals, large corporations, and small businesses, with its unanimous passage in the Senate despite concerns on both sides about whether it involves too much spending or not enough.\n\nThe package replaces the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months initially proposed, and provides $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. The package also includes $350 billion in funding for small businesses, with businesses with fewer than 500 employees eligible for up to $10 million in loans, which can be used for payroll and other expenses.\n\nThe latest unemployment numbers, released last Thursday, revealed that Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses around the country to close. This number eclipsed the previous record of 695,000, set in 1982, and is well above the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIt remains unclear what provisions the White House would like to see as part of any proposed infrastructure legislation. As of Tuesday morning, the U.S. reported over 164,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and over 3,170 deaths.",
    " Title: Biden Maintains Lead Over Trump in New Polls as 2020 Presidential Race Heats Up\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 The 2020 presidential race officially kicked off on Tuesday as President Donald Trump announced his re-election campaign in Orlando, Florida. However, recent polling suggests that Trump has a significant lead to overcome, with former Vice President Joe Biden currently holding a double-digit advantage over the incumbent president.\n\nIn a speech in Washington, DC, on Monday, Biden stated, \"I believe we can win Texas and Florida if you look at the polling data now.\" The new CBS battleground poll of early contest states shows Biden leading his Democratic primary opponents by a significant margin, with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris taking the other top spots.\n\nBiden also expressed his plans to campaign in the South, stating, \"I plan on campaigning in the South, and if I'm your nominee, winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign reportedly severed ties with several pollsters last week after unfavorable internal polls were leaked to the press. President Trump has denied the existence of these leaked polls, insisting they are \"phony\" and that he is \"actually a very honest guy.\"\n\nThe polls in question showed the president trailing Biden by double digits in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and by seven points in Florida, where Trump is officially announcing his re-election campaign. Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale dismissed the polls as \"ancient,\" adding that the campaign has seen \"huge swings in the president's favor\" since March.\n\nHowever, even a Fox News poll Sunday showed Trump trailing behind five Democratic candidates in hypothetical matchups. Trump insisted to ABC that he does not believe in pollsters, stating, \"I frankly do not even believe in pollsters if you want to know the truth, you just run a campaign and whatever it is, it is.\"\n\nPolitical reporter Julia Manchester from The Hill pointed out on a recent program that \"These are national polls, and I think one big lesson we've learned from 2016 is that national polls do not tell the whole story all the time.\"\n\nThe president maintained to ABC that he has a plan to win swing voters, stating, \"Safety, security, great economy.\" Trump also claimed that he thinks the president will do \"tremendously now with African Americans, with Asians, with Hispanics because they have the lowest unemployment numbers they've ever had in the history of the country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Democratic candidates are also campaigning and making their case to voters. For example, Senator Pete Buttigieg claimed that his campaign is working hard to engage black voters and that he plans to do the opposite of what the president has done by using identity as a wedge to divide people.\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic contenders appear united in going after President Trump, they will soon face off in debates next week, which could quickly change the dynamics of the race.",
    " Title: Germanwings Co-Pilot Suspected of Deliberately Crashing Plane, Killing 150\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps this week is suspected of deliberately crashing the aircraft, according to Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille.\n\nAt a news conference today, Robin confirmed reports about the pilot being heard on the voice recorder asking co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a German citizen, to take over the controls. The co-pilot, 27, took control, and the accelerated descent was made manually.\n\nLufthansa, which owns Germanwings, initially expressed shock at the French authorities' comments, but later accepted the crash was intentional. Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, stated, \"We have to accept that the plane was crashed on purpose.\"\n\nSpohr added, \"It seems to be true that the co-pilot denied the pilot access to the cockpit.\" He asked people not to rush to judgment, stating, \"The motivation could be of various nature.\"\n\nLubitz, who had 630 hours of flying time, underwent extensive psychological and aviation review since beginning training in 2008 and joining the company as a first officer in 2013, though his training was interrupted six years ago for an unspecified reason.\n\nProsecutor Robin said all seemed normal during the first 20 minutes of the flight, but later, the captain can be heard on the voice recording knocking on the door and asking to re-enter the cockpit, with no response from the co-pilot. The co-pilot can be heard breathing until the moment of impact, leading officials to believe he was alive until the crash.\n\nAir traffic control can also be heard calling, with no response from the cockpit. Toward the end of the descent, investigators can hear \"violent\" banging on the door as the pilot tries to get in.\n\nLufthansa CEO Spohr stated that pilots are able to enter a code to re-enter the cockpit, but that the pilot inside is able to disable the system electronically. So either the captain did not enter the code or Lubitz blocked his entry, he said.\n\nThe German Interior Ministry stated there is no evidence that Lubitz had a connection to terror. The ministry is also working closely with the Dusseldorf prosecutor, who has launched an investigation into the matter.\n\nReal-time updates on this developing story are available on \u2588\u2588\u2588's phone app. Download \u2588\u2588\u2588 for iPhone here or \u2588\u2588\u2588 for Android here.

    " Title: Supreme Court to Deliver Rulings on Travel Ban, Union Fees, and Abortion Clinic Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to issue rulings this week on several high-profile cases, including the legality of President Donald Trump's travel ban on people from five Muslim-majority countries, the issue of union fees for non-union workers, and California regulations on crisis pregnancy centers.\n\nThe nine justices are due to decide the remaining six cases, with rulings expected as early as Monday. The travel ban case, argued on April 25, is one of the most significant, testing the limits of presidential powers.\n\nTrump has maintained that the ban is necessary for national security, while critics argue it discriminates against Muslims. The conservative majority of the court seemed to support Trump's policy during arguments, signaling a potential upholding of the ban.\n\nLower courts have previously blocked the travel ban, the third version of a policy Trump implemented shortly after taking office in 2017. However, the high court allowed the ban to take full effect in December while the legal challenge continued.\n\nIn the union fees case, the court's conservatives indicated opposition during arguments in February to so-called agency fees that some states require non-members to pay to public-sector unions. These fees, which provide millions of dollars annually to these unions, are paid by workers who opt not to join unions representing certain state and local employees.\n\nThe court also faces a significant case concerning California regulations on crisis pregnancy centers, which provide alternatives to abortion. The justices seemed sceptical during arguments in March toward California's law requiring these centers to post notices about the availability of state-subsidized abortions and birth control. The justices indicated they would likely strike down at least part of the regulations.\n\nThe Supreme Court began its term in October and aims to make all its rulings by the end of June. The travel ban case, the union fees case, and the crisis pregnancy center case are among the few remaining cases to be decided.",
    " Title: Romney's Speech at NAACP: Navigating a Charged Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney found himself in a challenging situation on Wednesday, delivering a speech to the NAACP, an organization with a rich history in civil rights advocacy. The speech's backdrop was further complicated by the remarks made by Attorney General Eric Holder the previous day in Houston, which framed the proposed Texas voter ID law as potentially harmful to minority voters and drew parallels to segregationist policies of the past.\n\nHolder's speech, which referenced historical figures like George Wallace and the Jim Crow-era practice of poll taxes, highlighted the racial undertones in the 2012 presidential election for the Republican party: the contentious endeavor of challenging the nation's first African-American president.\n\nRomney, who has been cautious about discussing race, was expected to present his economic platform to the NAACP, despite the anticipated skepticism and the likelihood of President Barack Obama securing 90% of the black vote in November.\n\nTara Wall, a senior communications adviser to Romney, emphasized the importance of reaching out to black voters and building coalitions. She acknowledged the need to manage expectations and speak to voters where they are, while also offering an alternative choice in the election.\n\nHowever, the timing of Romney's speech could not have been more unfavorable. The NAACP convention provided a highly charged context for Romney's appearance, and the political landscape was already fraught with racial undercurrents. The challenge for Romney was to present his economic message effectively, while navigating the complex and sensitive racial dynamics of the 2012 presidential election.",
    " Title: US to Deploy Additional Troops to Iraq, Consider Strikes in Syria as Part of ISIS Counteroffensive\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of the US military's response to the Islamic State (ISIS), President Obama announced plans to deploy an additional 500 troops to Iraq, bringing the total number of troops deployed this summer to over 1,500. The majority of these troops will be stationed in operational command centers in Baghdad and Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish north.\n\nThe US military has conducted approximately 150 airstrikes in Iraq, but with the shift from a defensive to an offensive strategy, this number is expected to increase. The US troops will be tasked with various roles, including assessing the skills of Iraqi soldiers, operating armed drones, and helping to run the airstrikes.\n\nPresident Obama emphasized the need to \"go on offense\" against ISIS, signaling a more aggressive approach to the conflict. However, the US military's actions in Syria are not yet confirmed, with a senior defense official stating that the US military is prepared to conduct direct action against ISIS targets in Syria, but decisions about when to do so will be made at a prudent time.\n\nThe US's strategy to combat ISIS also involves ramping up assistance to the Syrian opposition. In the coming days, this will include a request to Congress for additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. However, determining who the \"moderate opposition\" is has proven challenging, with the less-extreme center of the Syrian opposition being small and shrinking.\n\nAnother complicating factor is the lack of a clear vision from the Free Syrian Army, the group most likely to receive the increased US backing, regarding what they would do with the Syrian state if they were to gain control. These questions about the \"end state\" in Iraq and Syria are crucial, as they inform the Pentagon's strategy.\n\nThe potential consequences of ISIS's defeat in Syria could strengthen the standing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his regime, while the removal of ISIS from Iraq could lead to increased tension between Sunnis and the Shiite-led government. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been replaced by Haider al-Abadi, but the potential for lingering resentments remains, as al-Maliki is set to become vice president.\n\nThese developments highlight the complexities and uncertainties involved in the US's strategy to combat ISIS, as the US military seeks to destroy the group while navigating the political landscape of Iraq and Syria.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen's Shift in Allegiance: From Trump's Fixer to Confessed Liar\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has undergone a significant transformation, from Cohen's declaration of unwavering loyalty to Trump's assertion that Cohen is a \"weak person.\"\n\nInitially, Cohen, who served as Trump's fixer and most ardent defender for over a decade, was known for his unwavering support for the President. \"If there's an issue that relates to Mr. Trump that is of concern to him, it's, of course, of concern to me. And I will use my legal skills within which to protect Mr. Trump to the best of my ability,\" Cohen had stated.\n\nHowever, the tide turned in April when the FBI raided Cohen's office as he became a target in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Trump initially came to Cohen's defense, but as the investigation zeroed in on Cohen, the lawyer began to change his tune. \"My wife, my daughter, and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first,\" Cohen declared.\n\nIn July, Cohen released an audio recording of a conversation with Trump from two months before the 2016 election, which appeared to discuss payments to a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. The revelation marked a significant turning point in the relationship between Trump and Cohen. In a tweet, Trump criticized Cohen, saying, \"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad!\"\n\nCohen's public fallout with Trump continued as he pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws in August and made a surprise court appearance in November where he confessed to lying to Congress about negotiations for a Moscow tower project during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors in the special counsel investigation have interviewed Cohen repeatedly over the past several months.\n\nCohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, stated, \"Mr. Cohen has cooperated. Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate.\" Trump, on the other hand, attempted to downplay the admission, stating, \"What he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So, he's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it.\"\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Cohen, once characterized by unwavering loyalty, has now become a source of legal and political drama. The full extent of Cohen's cooperation with the special counsel's investigation remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Romney Kicks Off \"Every Town Counts\" Tour in New Hampshire, Focuses on Rural America\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney embarked on a five-day bus tour on Friday, starting at the farm where he launched his presidential campaign last year. The tour, dubbed the \"Every Town Counts\" tour, will take Romney to small towns across the United States.\n\nIn his speech, Romney referred to the tour as the \"backbone of America,\" emphasizing his focus on rural communities. This is the first stop on a tour that will span five days and six swing states that voted for President Obama in 2008.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor's campaign is aiming to win over voters in rural areas, traditionally strongholds for the Republican party. Despite rural communities appearing solidly Republican these days, both presidential candidates are making efforts to appeal to small-town voters.\n\nDee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, notes that the American presidency has historically been associated with a connection to the wilderness. \"If it's Reagan on a horse or Clinton, the man from Hope [Arkansas], there's always been this kind of visual narrative or this story that to be president you had to be able to handle the wilderness, be comfortable outside of the city,\" he says.\n\nWhile it's unlikely to see Romney or Obama in a cowboy hat, both candidates are trying to connect with the folks who live in small towns. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who runs the Rural Council, a group of Cabinet members discussing policies aimed at rural America, points to the administration's plan to revitalize the rural economy.\n\nThe plan includes increasing exports, producing biofuels, and offering low-interest loans to small businesses in rural America. Exports have already seen significant growth over the past few years, and farmers are experiencing record profits. Vilsack attributes this growth to the Obama administration's efforts to help rural America.\n\nHowever, Jim Talent, a former senator from Missouri who advises the Romney campaign, disagrees. He argues that the increase in exports is due in part to a weak dollar, a result of the overall weak economy.\n\nDuring the tour, Romney will outline his ideas for helping rural America, including more oil and natural gas drilling, lower taxes, and deficit reduction. According to Talent, rural Americans understand that prosperity cannot be achieved through borrowing, a sentiment that Romney will likely emphasize during the tour.\n\nIn 2008, Obama lost rural counties by a smaller margin than past Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry or Al Gore. However, rural districts in Congress shifted towards the Republicans in 2010, with two-thirds of the 60 House seats won by the Republicans coming from rural America. This trend, according to Dee Davis, makes Romney's task of maintaining momentum in rural areas easier, while Obama faces the challenge of reversing the trend in the opposite direction.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 64: A Call for Legalizing and Regulating Marijuana for Adult Recreational Use\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the state of California, there is a growing movement to legalize, tax, and regulate marijuana for adult recreational use. This movement is spearheaded by Proposition 64, a ballot measure that aims to end the prohibition of marijuana and move the trade out of the shadows.\n\nThe argument for Proposition 64 is based on several factors. Marijuana, unlike other dangerous drugs such as opioids, has not been known to cause lethal human overdoses. In fact, the California Medical Association supports Proposition 64, citing the minimal health risks associated with marijuana use.\n\nMoreover, the criminalization of marijuana has been a contentious issue, with many arguing that it disproportionately affects young people of color. This is a social justice issue that has been largely ignored by political leaders in the past. However, with the legalization of recreational marijuana in states like Colorado and Washington, it has become clear that California will follow suit.\n\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a proponent of Proposition 64, has framed the issue as a means of ending the black market and regulating the trade. He told The Chronicle's editorial board, \"The goal is to end the black market.\"\n\nIt is important to note that in California, possession of less than an ounce of marijuana is no longer a misdemeanor, but an infraction punishable by a $100 fine. If Proposition 64 passes, minors caught with an ounce or less would be required to attend drug education or counseling programs and perform community service.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin, has endorsed Proposition 64. As a former prosecutor, Swalwell is not concerned about being labeled soft on crime. In 2014, he stated that he does not believe legalization would drive up usage.\n\nCritics of Proposition 64 have raised concerns about increased squalor on the streets, particularly in cities like San Francisco. However, it is important to note that other substances, such as alcohol and heroin, are the primary contributors to downtown squalor, not marijuana.\n\nIn conclusion, Proposition 64 aims to legalize and regulate marijuana for adult recreational use in California. The argument for Proposition 64 is based on the minimal health risks associated with marijuana, the disproportionate impact of marijuana prohibition on young people of color, and the potential for tax revenue and regulation of the marijuana trade. It remains to be seen whether Californians will vote in favor of Proposition 64 in the 2016 election.",
    " Title: Eleven Democratic Presidential Candidates Qualify for Fourth Primary Debate; Tulsi Gabbard Falls Short Despite Claiming Third Qualifying Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the Democratic presidential race, eleven candidates have now qualified for the fourth primary debate, scheduled for October 15 and potentially October 16. The qualification thresholds remain the same as those for the third debate: candidates must secure 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and October 1, and collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states.\n\nAs of September 9, the candidates who have qualified for the fourth debate are: Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Amy Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer.\n\nHowever, Tulsi Gabbard remains two polls shy of qualification despite some controversy. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this weekend, Gabbard had 1 percent support among all adult respondents but 2 percent among registered voters. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has confirmed that the number for all adults (where Gabbard got 1 percent) will be the one that counts this time, following their policy of using a poll's top-line number, which in this case was the support among all adults, as it appeared first in the survey.\n\nThis is not the first time the DNC has used the percentage among adults in their qualification process. In a previous ABC News/Washington Post survey, the DNC likewise used the percentage among adults.\n\nGabbard's campaign has expressed frustration with the DNC's polling standards in the past. On Sunday afternoon, well after the poll's release, Gabbard tweeted that the survey was her third poll, despite the DNC's clarification. With less than a month to go until the deadline for qualification for the fourth debate, every poll really does count, and Gabbard is going to need all the help she can get.\n\nSources: Polls, Media Reports.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Agreement on Human Trafficking Bill Clears Path for Loretta Lynch Confirmation Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant bipartisan breakthrough, the Senate has reached an agreement on the Human Trafficking Prevention Act, paving the way for a confirmation vote on Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch this week. The confirmation of Ms. Lynch, who has been pending since late last year, has been held up due to the human trafficking bill, which was stuck in a dispute over abortion funding.\n\nThe agreement, reached on Tuesday, involves rearranging funds for a victims' fund to come from existing health care money, effectively shelving the contentious abortion issue. The Senate could take final action on the trafficking bill on Wednesday, after which Republicans are expected to move on to Ms. Lynch's confirmation as promised.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington expressed her support for a swift confirmation for Ms. Lynch, who would be the first black woman to hold the nation's top law enforcement post. Ms. Lynch appears to have enough votes for confirmation, though just barely.\n\nConservatives have expressed reservations about Ms. Lynch, citing her defense of the legality of President Obama's deportation amnesty as evidence that she may not act as an independent constitutional referee. The White House has criticized Republican senators for insisting on completing the human trafficking bill first, stating that Ms. Lynch has waited longer than any other attorney general nominee in decades.\n\nSome Senate Democrats have suggested racial motives behind the Republicans' strategy, but the inaction has kept Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who is also black and disliked by Republicans, in office. Republicans argue that their insistence on finishing the human trafficking bill first validated their decision.\n\nThe Human Trafficking Prevention Act, which cleared committee on a unanimous vote, seemed destined for easy passage last month, until Democrats objected to a provision that applied the Hyde Amendment restrictions to fines collected from convicted traffickers. The bill now stipulates that money collected from traffickers will not go to health-related services but will be spent on services such as legal aid for victims. Health services for victims will be paid for by existing community health center funds with abortion restrictions, circumventing the need for another abortion fight.\n\nThe Senate still needs to pass the full Human Trafficking Prevention Act, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised lawmakers a chance to offer amendments. Some Republicans are eager to use the bill as a vehicle for fights over issues such as birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has warned against amending the bill, stating that it would upset the compromise.",
    " Title: Turkey and Syrian Kurds Clash Despite Ceasefire as Erdogan Threatens to \"Crush the Heads\" of Kurdish Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia, escalated over the weekend despite a five-day ceasefire agreement brokered by Turkey and the United States. The violence has continued in northeast Syria, with both sides accusing the other of violating the terms of the truce.\n\nDave Eubank, a representative of the private military company Free Burma Rangers, which provides emergency medical assistance, was on the ground near the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn. Eubank reported that the fighting has not stopped and movement in the area is severely limited, despite the ceasefire's intention to \"pause\" fighting to allow Syrian Kurds time and space to retreat from the area. Thousands of Kurdish civilians live in the so-called buffer zone.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened the Kurds on Saturday during a televised speech, saying they will be slaughtered if they do not pull back from the 20-mile-wide safe zone along the Turkey-Syria border by Tuesday night. \"We will start where we left off and continue to crush the terrorists' heads,\" Erdogan said.\n\nThe SDF has agreed to pull back from the border area and evacuate Ras al-Ayn, per the temporary peace agreement, as long as there are no delays. Redur Khalil, a senior SDF official, said forces will move back 19 miles from the border, withdrawing from the 75-mile area between Ras al-Ayn and Tal-Aybad. Kurdish forces said they coordinated the withdrawal with the Americans. This is the first time the Kurds have publicly acknowledged they will pull back.\n\nKhalil said a partial evacuation from Ras al-Ayn started Saturday after delays and coordinating with the U.S. Turkey claimed on Saturday it was living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement and accused the Kurds of violating it. The Turkish Defense Ministry said Kurdish forces carried out 14 \"provocative\" attacks in Ras al-Ayn in 36 hours, according to the BBC.\n\nThe SDF said there has been \"no tangible progress\" in solving the issues at the northeast border. As of Friday, 86 civilians had been killed since Turkey launched its military offensive into Syria on Oct. 9, according to a war monitor, the BBC reported. Erdogan claimed the move was to \"neutralize terror threats\" and establish a \"safe zone.\" After carrying out airstrikes, Turkish ground troops later invaded northeastern Syria.\n\nNearly all U.S. troops there have been removed and will be redeployed in the region in the coming weeks. The U.S. had teamed up with the Kurds to fight ISIS in the region. Some analysts and politicians criticized President Trump for removing American forces, saying it was a \"green light\" for Ankara to invade Syria and fight the Kurds. Trump said the Turks have been \"warring for many years,\" and that the U.S. does not need to protect war-torn Syria because it's \"7,000 miles away.\" The president on Friday claimed \"thousands and thousands\" of lives were being saved in Syria and Turkey due to the ceasefire.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski's Role Shrinks as Paul Manafort Takes a Leading Role\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the public eye, Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, stands by the embattled political figure as he faces battery charges for an incident involving a reporter. However, behind the scenes, Lewandowski's role in the campaign is diminishing.\n\nAccording to three sources close to the campaign, Trump's just-named convention manager, Paul Manafort, is expected to take a leading role not just in the selection of delegates but also in the remaining primaries. This shift is a natural progression of the campaign's maturation, but it is also partly due to long-standing concerns among some members of Trump's inner circle about Lewandowski's lack of national experience, his perceived unwillingness to challenge Trump, and his brash temperament.\n\nThese concerns resurfaced this week when Lewandowski was charged by police in Jupiter, Florida, with simple battery related to a March 8 encounter with a reporter then working for the conservative Breitbart News.\n\nA person involved in Trump's campaign stated, \"I'm not saying Corey's going to be fired or anything because I don't think he's going to be, at least not at this juncture. But Mr. Trump's listening to other people now. The crew's expanding. The inner circle is not what it used to be.\"\n\nNeither Lewandowski nor the campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, responded to requests for comment.\n\nLewandowski's influence over the campaign began to wane soon after voting started this winter, when Michael Glassner's title was changed from national political director to deputy campaign manager, a change billed as a promotion. This move sparked enduring resentment toward Glassner among Lewandowski's loyalists on the campaign, including many friends he hired from his home state of New Hampshire and a number of his fellow alums of the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity.\n\nOn March 2, the campaign promoted Stuart Jolly, who had served as Southeast political director, to national field director, giving him primary authority over the hiring and firing of field staff. Lewandowski had brought on the former AFP employee.\n\nTrump's candidacy has been characterized by high-octane rallies, and Lewandowski has been a near-constant presence at Trump's side as the businessman toured the country in his private jet, often making it difficult for other campaign staff and Trump allies to communicate directly with the candidate, who carries a cellphone but does not regularly communicate by email.\n\nFour people close to the Trump family and campaign say the concerns about Lewandowski's temperament and certain aspects of his performance extend deep into Trump's inner circle.\n\nLewandowski, a former New Hampshire state marine patrol officer, has a history as a confrontational anti-establishment figure stemming from his work running the failed 2002 reelection campaign of Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who was on the outs with the GOP after running for president as an independent two years earlier. Lewandowski cemented his anti-establishment bona fides during his time at Americans for Prosperity, where he antagonized some Republicans.\n\nThis reputation may compromise the campaign's fledgling effort to court the Republican National Committee, its officials, and members, one Trump friend suggested.\n\nPeople close to Trump \"have voiced concerns that Trump is not going to be able to win over the party apparatus if they have someone like Corey running the show,\" the friend said.\n\nBetween March 15 and Trump's reemergence on the campaign trail this week in Wisconsin, the businessman spent several days at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, one of the few places where Lewandowski remains far from his side.\n\nDuring this period, Trump hired Manafort as convention manager, a move first reported by The New York Times on Monday. Manafort, a longtime associate of Roger Stone, Trump's friend and adviser, who left the campaign in August as Lewandowski consolidated control, but continued to serve as a surrogate for Trump and to consult with him.\n\nManafort has quickly taken charge of his own fiefdom in Washington. He is planning to hire a team of his own, which is likely to include several veterans of the 1976 Republican National Convention\u2014the party's last convention at which the presidential nomination was contested\u2014though he remains below Lewandowski on the organizational chart.\n\n\"He technically still reports to Corey, and Corey technically still has the title,\" according to a person familiar with Manafort's role.\n\nOn March 8, Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged Lewandowski roughly grabbed her following a news conference at Trump's golf club in Jupiter. Lewandowski tweeted that Fields was \"delusional\" and that he had never touched her.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Jupiter police released security camera footage showing Lewandowski grabbing Fields and announced that Lewandowski had been arrested on a simple battery charge. Lewandowski and the campaign both maintain Lewandowski's innocence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lewandowski was scheduled to appear on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" but the campaign scrapped the appearance.\n\nTrump has forcefully defended his campaign manager in the face of mounting criticism. Trump even blamed Fields for the incident, threatening to file charges against her, saying she grabbed him, and that a pen she held in her hand could have been a dangerous weapon.\n\nFollowing scrutiny of the campaign's habit of denying press credentials to reporters whose coverage displeases the candidate and his staff, the press office has overridden Lewandowski's decisions about issuing press credentials, according to the person involved in Trump's campaign.\n\nMany news organizations, including \u2588\u2588\u2588, have had reporters excluded from Trump's rallies and events, often after publishing stories critical of the candidate or his aides.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allied Nations Discuss Online Extremism and Encryption with Tech Companies Amid Rise in Hate Crimes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the racially-motivated attack in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead, the United States and several allied nations are urging technology companies to take a more active role in monitoring and addressing online extremism. This comes as the pattern of hate-filled manifestos posted on white supremacist websites, followed by gun attacks against minority groups, continues to emerge.\n\nFollowing the El Paso shooting, President Donald Trump called for increased police efforts to stop extremists who are active online before they can turn to violence. However, law enforcement experts warn that identifying and stopping extremists who plan to launch an attack is a complex task.\n\nThe constitutional right of free speech means that police cannot arrest someone solely on the basis of extremist rants online, unless they make a specific threat. Dave Gomez, a retired FBI agent who has worked on cases of both international and domestic terrorism, stated, \"You couldn\u2019t just open a case on the words. Posting something like that on the internet doesn\u2019t harm anybody. Police can only successfully investigate a white supremacist when you can 'connect his words to an overt act.'\"\n\nIn response to the growing concern, the White House will discuss violent extremism online with representatives from a number of internet and technology companies on Friday. Social media companies are reluctant to spy on or censor their users, though they are increasingly responding to demands that they take down obvious incitements to violence.\n\nThe FBI has already taken steps to address the issue, requesting bids for a contractor to help it detect national security threats by trawling through social media sites. Top law enforcement and domestic security officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have also met with leading social media and internet companies to push for increased cooperation.\n\nHowever, the issue of encryption remains a contentious one. The agenda paper for the meeting noted that some companies \"deliberately design their systems in a way that precludes any form of access to content, even in cases of the most serious crimes.\" The final statement from the meeting did not address encryption, and neither company nor government officials talked about what was discussed.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes internet civil liberties, stated that the sheer amount of users posting aggressive content online makes it almost impossible to identify and track the people who pose an actual threat. Jeremy Gillula, the group's tech products director, compared it to trying to predict where lightning is going to strike.\n\nAs the debate continues, the FBI Agents Association has called on Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime in order to give agents more tools. The challenge remains to balance the need for law enforcement to monitor online activity with the constitutional rights of free speech and privacy.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out Conference on Senate Immigration Bill, Reiterates Step-by-Step Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday unequivocally ruled out any possibility of a conference with the Senate on the immigration bill passed by the upper chamber, effectively ending any hopes for comprehensive immigration reform this year.\n\nBoehner, who has long opposed the Senate-passed bill, reiterated his stance and declared that the House would never vote on the legislation. He further clarified that there would be no negotiations on the Senate bill, stating, \"I'll make clear we have no intention ever of going to conference on the Senate bill.\"\n\nLast week, the third-ranking House Republican, GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy, had indicated that there was not enough time left this year for the House to take up immigration reform, with the House being in session for only 15 days between now and the end of the year.\n\nFollowing the 2012 presidential election, in which Republicans lost the Hispanic vote and President Obama received overwhelming support from this demographic, Boehner had expressed the need for Congress to pass major immigration reforms. He had stated, \"I think a comprehensive approach is long overdue. And I\u2019m confident that the president, myself, others can find the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all.\"\n\nFacing internal divisions within his conference on the issue, Boehner insists that he still wants action but any legislation must be addressed in a piecemeal manner. \"I want us to deal with this issue, but I want to deal with it in a common-sense step-by-step way,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nA series of targeted immigration bills have passed the House Judiciary Committee, focusing primarily on border security and enforcement. However, GOP leaders have not scheduled any floor votes on any of these bills. A significant bloc of House conservatives is vehemently opposed to any measure that provides a path to citizenship or legal status for the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States. So far, none of the House GOP proposals address this issue, but opponents worry that any negotiation with the Senate would increase pressure on House Republicans to tackle questions of citizenship.\n\nBoehner's statement on Wednesday, declaring no talks with the Senate on its bill, was intended to alleviate these concerns. The Speaker dismissed a question regarding whether House GOP leaders were avoiding the contentious debate on immigration reform to focus on issues with the implementation of Obamacare.\n\n\"This is about trying to do this in a way that the American people and our members can absorb,\" Boehner said, adding that immigration reform is too complex to rush. \"There are hundreds of issues involved in dealing with immigration reform, and we've got to deal with these in a common-sense way where our members understand what we're doing and their constituents understand.\"",
    " Title: DREAMer Astrid Silva Receives Personal Mention in President Obama's Immigration Address, Expresses Relief and Ongoing Advocacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his national address on immigration Thursday night, President Barack Obama highlighted the story of Astrid Silva, a DREAMer who felt \"complete relief\" as Obama laid out his plan to shield up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation. Silva, an undocumented immigrant who came to the U.S. with her parents when she was four, was surprised to hear her story told by the President.\n\n\"It was completely unexpected. I didn't know that it was coming,\" Silva said in an interview with CNN Friday. During his speech, Obama said, \"Astrid was brought to America when she was 4 years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on.\"\n\nSilva was motivated to begin advocating for herself and other undocumented immigrants when her grandmother died, and she could not travel to Mexico for her funeral. \"Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrants like Astrid or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in?\" Obama said Thursday.\n\nSilva watched the speech while standing next to her father, who is facing deportation orders but could get temporary legal status thanks to Obama's action because her brother, Silva's brother, is a U.S. citizen, according to the Washington Post. Obama's orders will give papers and work authorization to up to 4 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens.\n\n\"We won't have to worry that this is going to be our last holidays together,\" she said. \"It was just very emotional.\" Silva will meet Obama on Friday when he heads to Las Vegas to continue making his case at a high school.\n\nSilva expressed relief over Obama's actions, but said what's missing is still \"a law by Congress, since they refused to act on it.\" \"A lot of parents of students who are undocumented are not included,\" she said. \"We are going to continue fighting for them, and this is not the end.\"",
    " Title: Social Media's Toxic Influence: A Case Study on Charlie Sheen and Carl Paladino's Controversial Tweets\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, social media platforms have become a significant platform for expression, fostering open dialogue and the sharing of ideas. However, the darker side of this digital realm is the venom and hate speech that often permeate it, threatening to desensitize society as a whole. A recent example of this can be seen in the controversial tweets of actors Charlie Sheen and Carl Paladino.\n\nCharlie Sheen, a well-known liberal figure in Hollywood, took to Twitter to express his disdain for President-elect Donald Trump, wishing for his death. In the aftermath of the tragic deaths of Carrie Fisher and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, Sheen tweeted, \"Dear God; Trump next, please! Trump next, please!\" This call for the death of the president-elect sparked a heated debate on social media.\n\nWhen this journalist denounced Sheen's tweet, responses ranged from justification to outright agreement with the actor's sentiments. Some users argued that Sheen's wish for Trump's death was acceptable due to the political differences between the two, while others applauded Sheen for speaking out.\n\nIn a similar vein, Carl Paladino, a former New York co-chairman for Trump's campaign and member of the Buffalo school board, made headlines for his own controversial tweets. Paladino had called for the death of President Obama, stating he hoped the president would die of mad cow disease. Regarding Michelle Obama, Paladino wished for her to \"return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.\" These racist remarks were followed by an apology from Paladino and a denouncement from the Trump campaign.\n\nIt is important to note that while freedom of speech and the expression of political views are essential, the line should not be crossed when it comes to wishing for the death of political figures or resorting to racist, misogynist, or anti-Semitic sentiments. Decent folks have every right to denounce such unacceptable behavior.\n\nIn the case of Sheen and Paladino, the response to their tweets was telling. While Sheen's remarks barely caused a ripple, perhaps due to the intense negative coverage Trump has received, if a celebrity as well-known as Sheen had called for Obama's death, there would have been a barrage of headlines. Alternatively, the toxic nature of social media may have played a role in the lack of attention given to Paladino's racist remarks, as such content often fails to rise to the surface in the sea of controversy that social media has become.\n\nIn conclusion, social media serves as a powerful tool for expression, but it is crucial to remember that the line between free speech and hate speech should not be crossed. The recent cases of Charlie Sheen and Carl Paladino serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining respect and decency in our digital discourse.",

The decision was made following a series of escalating tensions between the two nations.\n\nIn a letter released by the White House on Thursday, President Trump expressed his disappointment in recent behavior by the North Korean regime. He wrote, \"We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant.\"\n\nThe President went on to say, \"I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.\"\n\nThe letter further stated, \"You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.\" Trump also acknowledged the positive dialogue that had been building between the two leaders, expressing hope for future meetings.\n\nThe decision comes after repeated threats from North Korea, including nuclear war, and after the regime called Vice President Mike Pence a \"dummy.\" This is a developing story, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.",

John McCain Defends Ousted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Amidst White House Resignation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's resignation, key lawmaker Sen. John McCain has spoken out in defense of the former Pentagon boss, criticizing the White House for a perceived whispering campaign that accompanied Hagel's departure.\n\nIn a radio interview with KFYI, McCain, who is expected to take control of the Senate Armed Services Committee in January, stated, \"I thank Chuck Hagel for his service, and I know that he was very, very frustrated.\"\n\nMcCain, who served in the Senate with Hagel from 1996-2008, opposed Hagel's appointment to defense secretary but noted that administration sources were wrong to assail Hagel on his way out the door.\n\n\"Already White House people are leaking, \u2018Well, he wasn\u2019t up to the job,\u2019\" McCain said. \"Well, believe me, he was up to the job. It was the job he was given, where he really was never really brought into that real tight circle inside the White House that makes all the decisions which has put us into the incredible debacle that we\u2019re in today throughout the world.\"\n\nMcCain highlighted Hagel's characterization of the Islamic State as the greatest threat in the Middle East, contrasting it with President Obama's description of them as the \"jayvee (junior varsity)\" team less than a year ago. He also criticized Obama for failing in areas like the Middle East, Ukraine, and responding to a newly aggressive China.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had our disagreements, but Chuck Hagel is an honorable man,\" McCain added.\n\nAt the news conference, Obama praised Hagel as \"an exemplary defense secretary\" and a steady hand for strategy and budget. Obama said he'll always be grateful that Hagel has always \"given it to me straight.\"\n\nHagel, who served as U.S. Army sergeant in Vietnam and received two Purple Hearts, took office less than two years ago and was charged with overseeing the winding down of decade-long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also steered the military during sweeping changes involving gays and women in the military.\n\nHowever, in recent months, the Pentagon has taken on new challenges, including fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and deploying military personnel to Africa to fight Ebola. Sources told FoxNews.com that Obama's dissatisfaction with Hagel, as well as a desire to shake up the cabinet following the devastating midterm elections, played a role in the president seeking Hagel's ouster.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Secretary Hagel was fired,\" a senior U.S. official with close knowledge of the situation told Fox News. This official discounted Pentagon claims it was a mutual decision, claiming President Obama has lost confidence in Hagel and that the White House had been planning to announce his exit for weeks.\n\nHagel submitted his resignation letter to Obama Monday morning, and the president accepted it. Hagel agreed to remain in office until his successor is confirmed by the Senate. The president is not expected to nominate a new Pentagon chief Monday, according to one official.\n\nThe officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name ahead of Obama's official announcement. Hagel, the only Republican on Obama\u2019s cabinet, served as senator from Nebraska for two terms, beginning in 1996, and became a critic of U.S. involvement in Iraq. Obama nominated him to succeed Leon Panetta as Defense Secretary in his second term.\n\nRecent questions about Hagel's future at the Pentagon were prompted in part by his decision to postpone a long-planned trip this month to Vietnam. At the time, officials said he needed to remain in Washington for congressional consultations, but that did not stop speculation that the White House might be looking for a replacement for the final two years of Obama's term.\n\nJust last week, Hagel was asked about the speculation during an interview on the Charlie Rose show. He was asked whether he's concerned by the speculation.\n\n\"No. First of all, I serve at the pleasure of the president,\" Hagel said. \"I\u2019m immensely grateful for the opportunity I\u2019ve had the last two years to work every day for the country and for the men and women who serve this country. I do not get up in the morning and worry about my job. It\u2019s not unusual by the way, to change teams at different times.\"",
    " Title: Whistleblower Alleges Secret Appointment Lists at Chicago's Hines VA Medical Center, Amidst Ongoing VA Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article- In the midst of the ongoing controversy surrounding secret appointment lists at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, a new allegation has surfaced, this time involving Chicago's Hines VA Medical Center. A whistleblower, VA social worker Germaine Clarno, has come forward, claiming that the hospital maintains secret lists to manipulate appointment wait times and potentially collect bonuses.\n\nCBS News interviewed Ms. Clarno, who alleged that the lists are not just a means to game the required appointment wait time, but also to collect bonuses for doing so. When asked about the extent of the fraud, Ms. Clarno stated, \"We're talking about surgery, radiology, women's clinic, all those different areas, all the specialties, all the clinics.\"\n\nThe allegations suggest a systemic fraud within a bureaucracy that appears to prioritize numbers over the well-being of veterans. Ms. Clarno's claims follow the initial revelation of similar practices at the VA in Phoenix, where it was reported that 40 veterans may have died due to long wait times and hidden appointment lists.\n\nThe alleged actions at the VA hospitals have sparked outrage, with many questioning the integrity of the system and calling for a criminal investigation. The cruelty of these actions, which may have led to the deaths of veterans in Phoenix, underscores the inhumanity of the bureaucracy and raises concerns about the treatment of veterans in the federal healthcare system.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate controversy has emerged regarding the treatment of convicted traitor Bradley Manning, who was recently approved for transfer from Fort Leavenworth to a civilian prison to receive \"gender treatment.\" Manning, who was convicted of sending classified documents to WikiLeaks, has been diagnosed with \"gender dysphoria\" and is seeking hormone therapy and other medical treatment to align his physical appearance with his self-identified gender.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Manning's treatment has sparked debate, with some arguing that denying treatment could constitute cruel and unusual punishment. However, the high cost of Manning's treatment, which could exceed $100,000, has raised questions about the fairness of providing such extensive healthcare to a convicted traitor, while veterans may be facing long wait times and hidden appointment lists at VA hospitals.\n\nThe allegations at the VA hospitals and the controversy surrounding Manning's treatment have raised concerns about the priorities and values of the federal government, with some arguing that the system is prioritizing the needs of criminals over those of the brave men and women who have served our country.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Study Reveals Most Effective Techniques for Reducing Partisan Hostility in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to address the growing hostility between liberals and conservatives in the United States, a team of researchers, including Matt Motyl, Brian Nosek, Jon Haidt, and the author, conducted a study to determine the most effective strategies for reducing partisan hostility. The study, which tested the effectiveness of five interventions, aimed to provide insights into the most effective methods for promoting civility between the opposing parties.\n\nThe five interventions tested were:\n1. Self Affirmation: Participants were asked to write about a valued personal characteristic and a time they embodied that trait.\n2. Learning Political Membership Last: Participants were exposed to a very positive group of individuals who turned out to be members of the opposing political party.\n3. Observing Civility: Participants watched a video describing the relationship between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Tip O'Neill, highlighting their friendly and respectful relationship.\n4. Superordinate Threat: Participants read an article describing the threat of cyber warfare attacks on the United States, emphasizing the potential for bipartisan efforts to eliminate this threat.\n5. Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions: This intervention sought to weaken the perception of legislation as a zero-sum game by describing the consequences of this mentality and the ways it is inhibiting progress.\n\nThe study, which was conducted online, found that each intervention produced the desired effect of lowering hostility, but the degree of effectiveness varied. Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions was the most effective intervention at reducing hostility, closely followed by Superordinate Threat. The results also showed that none of the interventions reduced implicit or explicit liking for one's own party relative to the other party. In fact, most interventions increased partisan preferences relative to the control condition.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that there are multiple paths to reducing partisan hostility, but not all strategies are equally effective. Interestingly, the intervention that produced the best results (Reducing Zero Sum Perceptions) was the least based on past psychological research. As such, when trying to reduce the hostility in the current political environment, it is advisable to pay attention to the nuances of the current sources of hostility. As time goes by, the issues that divide us change, and our attempts to bridge those gaps should adapt with them.\n\nFor more information about the interventions used in the study, see the Civil Politics Contest Study-Materials document.

    " Title: Federal Judge Halts Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration, Citing Overreach of Presidential Authority\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a federal judge in Texas has put a halt to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, two days before they were due to take effect. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled that the president overstepped his authority, halting both the new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and the expansions to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nIn a 120-page court document issued late Monday, Hanen halted the executive actions that would have provided legal status to millions of people. Hanen stated that if the actions were to take effect, \"The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle.\"\n\nPresident Obama, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the Justice Department will appeal this decision, and he is confident that the executive action he took is \"well within my authority.\" He also called on Congress to act, stating that he had taken this action because he would not \"stand by and do nothing.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said that because of the injunction, his agency \"will not begin accepting requests for the expansion of DACA tomorrow, February 18, as originally planned.\" Until further notice, they will also suspend the plan to accept requests for DAPA. Johnson clarified that the court's order \"does not affect the existing DACA,\" and that it will not change the enforcement priorities he outlined when President Obama set his plan in motion last November.\n\nThe Justice Department will appeal the temporary injunction, the White House said. The injunction gives 26 states more time to form legal arguments against the actions, which were expected to protect as many as 4 million people who are in the U.S. illegally from being deported. The plan also includes an option to apply for work permits.\n\nThe states had argued that the changes would cause \"dramatic and irreparable injuries,\" as reported by NPR's Richard Gonzales on Morning Edition. For example, the state of Texas estimates that it was spending $1.3 million sending police to deal with border security during the surge of unaccompanied minors that crossed the border this past summer.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, Gonzales reports, \"there are 12 states, the District of Columbia, and 33 mayors across the country who are supporting the Obama administration. They say the executive action would benefit them, because workers who are here illegally would come out of the shadows and work and pay taxes.\"\n\nObama announced his plan weeks after last November's midterm elections, saying that he was taking action because Congress had not sent him a bill addressing the problems in America's immigration system. Before the ruling came out late Monday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had been preparing to begin accepting applications under the new rules on Wednesday.\n\nThe Texas lawsuit against the president's executive orders was initially filed in December by Gov. Greg Abbott, who was then the state's attorney general. Abbott accused the president of violating several provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including one that gives Congress jurisdiction over immigration laws. Abbott also argued that Texas would be irreparably harmed by the action, citing last summer's surge of undocumented immigrants from Central America who entered Texas illegally through the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nWelcoming the injunction, the current attorney general in Texas, Ken Paxton, called it \"a victory for the rule of law in America and a crucial first step in reining in President Obama's lawlessness.\" In his decision, Judge Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush who has been in his post since 2002, also noted that there has been a political and national debate over how to handle both legal and illegal immigration. He added, \"To date, however, neither the President nor any member of Congress has proposed legislation capable of resolving these issues in a manner that could garner the necessary support to be passed into law.\"",
    " Title: Dutch Attorney Indicted for False Statements in Mueller Investigation: Implications for Mueller's Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development in the ongoing Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller's office has indicted Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan for making false statements to the FBI. The indictment, which was released on Tuesday, sheds light on the intricate web of connections between van der Zwaan, Rick Gates, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nVan der Zwaan's connection to the Russia case stems from his work with Rick Gates, who was indicted alongside Manafort in October on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying. The connection is complex, revolving around an internal Ukrainian political dispute from over a decade ago, but it offers insights into the current state of the Russia investigation.\n\nIn the early 2010s, van der Zwaan was working in the London office of Skadden Arps, one of the world's largest and most powerful corporate law firms. His work primarily focused on the former Soviet Union. During the same period, Manafort and Gates were working for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin-backed leader with questionable democratic credentials.\n\nYanukovych was embroiled in a power struggle with another prominent Ukrainian politician, which he resolved by imprisoning her in the fall of 2011. Manafort and Gates were tasked with covering up this undemocratic prosecution, so they hired a team from Skadden Arps, including van der Zwaan, to produce a report concluding that there was no political motive for the imprisonment.\n\nThe report, while significant in Ukraine, was relatively obscure for the rest of the world. Manafort and Gates continued their work for Yanukovych, and van der Zwaan moved on to other assignments, notably marrying Eva Khan, the daughter of Ukrainian-Russian billionaire German Khan, in the summer of 2017. (One of Khan's companies is mentioned in the infamous Steele dossier.)\n\nHowever, the Mueller investigation would soon cast a shadow over van der Zwaan's honeymoon. As the investigation delved into Manafort and Gates' ties to the Kremlin, it began investigating the Skadden Arps report. According to the indictment, FBI agents questioned van der Zwaan in November 2017 about his communications with Gates and an unidentified Person A.\n\nVan der Zwaan told them that his last communication with Gates was in August 2016 and was an \"innocuous text message,\" and that he hadn't spoken to Person A since 2014. This, according to the indictment, is a lie\u2014van der Zwaan was actually secretly communicating with Gates and Person A about the Skadden report.\n\n\"In or about September 2016, he spoke with both Gates and Person A regarding the Report, and surreptitiously recorded the call,\" the indictment states.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that van der Zwaan deleted an email between himself and Person A sent around the same time as those conversations\u2014and told the FBI that he \"did not know\" where the email was.\n\nVan der Zwaan is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday at 2:30 pm EST to answer the indictment. He is expected to plead guilty, according to reports.\n\nThe key piece of information in all of this is the timing: Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign manager on August 19, 2016\u2014weeks before the alleged conversations between Gates, Person A, and van der Zwaan. If Gates and van der Zwaan were discussing the Skadden report in September 2016, and van der Zwaan felt the need to lie to the FBI about it, it suggests that there may have been something criminal about the report's production\u2014or at least, something whose release would be politically damaging.\n\nInterestingly, both CBS News and the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that Gates had struck a plea deal with Mueller and would testify against Manafort, his former boss. It's not a stretch to think that evidence provided by van der Zwaan\u2014like his \"surreptitious\" recording of his call with Gates and Person A\u2014helped Mueller build a case strong enough that Gates had no choice but to flip.\n\nGates, as Manafort's longtime assistant, might well have incriminating information on his former boss, who is one of the most pivotal players in the whole Trump-Russia scandal. It's conceivable that van der Zwaan might end up being the first domino in a chain of events that leads to a major breakthrough\u2014a Manafort conviction or plea deal.\n\nRight now, that's speculation: We don't know how the Manafort case is actually going to play out. But that's almost certainly Mueller's strategy\u2014get van der Zwaan to get to Gates to get to Manafort, and from there, get vital information about Trump's real ties to Russia.\n\nWhat this shows, more than anything else, is how methodical and wide-ranging the Mueller investigation is\u2014that it's willing to look all the way back to an obscure report from the winter of 2012 in order to get to the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal. Mueller is starting at the lowest level, with seemingly unrelated people like van der Zwaan, to get to the big fish.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Online Sales Tax Bill, Faces Challenges in House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has taken a significant step towards requiring online retailers to collect sales tax on purchases delivered to states that would normally impose such taxes. The Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), which passed with a vote of 69 to 27, now moves to the House for consideration.\n\nHowever, the path for the MFA in the House is uncertain due to the reservations of key Republican lawmaker, Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Despite bipartisan support, the legislation must pass through Goodlatte's committee before it can be voted on by the full House.\n\nConservative groups argue that it is unconstitutional to force e-retailers to collect sales tax when they have no physical presence in a state. They also contend that the legislation will create compliance burdens and diminish tax competition among the states.\n\nOn the other hand, conventional retailers and state governments are urging the House to pass the MFA. They argue that it will \"level the playing field\" between traditional and online retailers, and bring in additional tax revenues.\n\nSoftware now makes it possible for retailers to calculate sales taxes, which vary from state to state and city to city, just as easily as they calculate shipping charges. The law mandates that each state make sales tax software available free of charge to e-commerce businesses.\n\nMost states are in favor of the law, as they see a large pot of uncollected sales taxes. A 2009 University of Tennessee study projected unpaid sales taxes from Internet sales would amount to $23 billion in 2012.\n\nThe dispute over collecting sales tax dates back to a 1992 US Supreme Court decision that barred states from requiring a retailer to collect sales taxes unless the retailer had a physical presence in the taxing state. The MFA aims to change this by allowing states to require sales tax collection from e-retailers with more than $1 million in annual sales.\n\nRepresentative Goodlatte has expressed deep reservations about the MFA, citing concerns about complexity in tax collection, potential aggressive action by state tax bureaus, and the lack of uniformity in tax rates and definitions. His reservations have led some independent analysts to question the legislation's future.\n\nThe MFA proponents argue that this is a tax already on the books and a collection issue, rather than a new tax. They hope that this argument will sway the House to approve the legislation. However, a major change, such as adopting an \"origin sourcing\" approach, would require a House and Senate conference to work out differences in the legislation.\n\nNot all conservatives oppose the MFA. On May 6, Colin Hanna of Let Freedom Ring and Al Cardenas of American Conservative Union endorsed the bill, stating that it does not impose new taxes and is a collection issue.\n\nThe MFA's journey through the legislative process will be closely watched as it moves to the House, with its ultimate success dependent on the House's response to the concerns raised by Representative Goodlatte and other critics.",
    " Title: U.S. Cancels Long-Range Interceptors in Europe, Shifts Focus to North Korea Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the U.S. has decided to abandon a part of a European missile defense system, replacing it with 14 interceptors in Alaska and California. This decision, announced on Friday, marks the second major change to the missile defense program since President Barack Obama took office.\n\nThe Obama administration cited development problems and a lack of funding as reasons for the cancellation of the interceptors initially planned for deployment in Poland and Romania in the early 2020s. The move could potentially open up new avenues for arms control talks, as it addresses concerns raised by Russia, a strong opponent of the European system.\n\nRussian officials had long suspected that the interceptors were a counter to their missiles and had indicated that they would not consider further nuclear arms cuts unless their concerns were addressed. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made no direct reference to Russia's objections in his statement, but emphasized that other parts of the program in Europe would move forward, and the U.S. commitment to missile defense in the region \"remains ironclad.\"\n\nThe restructuring includes a $1 billion investment to add the 14 new interceptors to the existing 26 in underground silos in Alaska. The shift in U.S. missile defense plans in Europe could cause unease among some U.S. allies, including Poland and Romania, who view the system as a sign of U.S. engagement in the region and a counterweight to Russia.\n\nMissile defense has been a contentious issue since President George W. Bush sought to base long-range interceptors in Central Europe to counter Iranian missiles reaching the U.S. Russia believed the program was aimed at countering its own missiles and undermining its nuclear deterrent.\n\nObama reworked the Bush administration's plan soon after taking office in 2009. He canceled an earlier interceptor planned for Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, replacing high-speed interceptors with slower ones that could stop Iran's medium-range missiles.\n\nUnder Obama's plan, the interceptors were to be upgraded gradually over four phases, culminating early next decade with those intended to protect both Europe and the United States. However, Russia has ramped up its criticism of Obama's revisions, and relations between the two powers have become strained.\n\nThe decision to cancel plans for the long-range interceptors in Europe is expected to help the president's arms control goals. A senior State Department official, speaking anonymously due to diplomatic sensitivities, said that Poland and Romania were informed of the decision ahead of the announcement, but that Russia was not.\n\nTom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, stated, \"Canceling Phase 4 opens the door to another round of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reductions. We give up nothing since Phase 4 was not panning out anyway. This is a win-win for the United States.\"\n\nThe issue is particularly sensitive because Obama was overheard whispering in an open microphone last year telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at an international summit that he would have more flexibility on resolving their differences over the missile defense program after his re-election in November. The comment suggested that he might change the plans in Europe.\n\nFriday's decision was criticized by Republicans in Congress, who have charged that Obama has undermined allies while pursuing his goals to drastically cut nuclear weapons. GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who heads the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees U.S. missile defense programs, stated, \"President Obama's reverse course decision will cost the American taxpayer more money and upset our allies.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Hagel emphasized that the U.S. remains committed to all other parts of the plan, including the first three phases. He stated that the decision was prompted by the need to address faster-than-anticipated progress by North Korea on nuclear weapons and missiles. The changes free up the money to do so, he said.\n\nHagel cited North Korea's December rocket launch that put a satellite into space and showed mastery of some of the technologies needed to produce a long-range nuclear missile. He also noted that last April, the North Koreans publicly displayed a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, the KN-08, which is believed to be capable of reaching the U.S.\n\nThe missile defense system was first fielded by the Bush administration in late 2004. It has a spotty test record and has never been used in actual combat. In addition to the 26 interceptors in Alaska, the system includes four interceptors in California. Hagel stated that the 14 additional interceptors should be in place in Alaska by September 2017, but not before they have been tested adequately. The European-based interceptors would not have protected the United States from North Korea.",
    " Title: Jefferies' Christopher Wood: Encouraging COVID-19 Trends and Market Outlook\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the coronavirus pandemic, fund managers and analysts are finding themselves in the role of amateur epidemiologists. One such analyst, Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, is expressing optimism over the latest COVID-19 data.\n\nWood points to a significant decline in the median age of new positive cases in Florida, from 50 in April to 33 in recent days. Crucially, deaths are also decreasing, even as new cases continue to rise. This trend, Wood suggests, could indicate that the virus is mutating into a less virulent form over time, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\"If such is indeed the case, it is extremely bullish. Investors should certainly keep an open mind on such a possibility,\" Wood says.\n\nMore positive news comes from Western Europe, where new cases and deaths, excluding the U.K., are approximately 90% lower eight weeks into reopening.\n\nWood recommends a \"barbell strategy\" of owning both growth and value stocks. He explains that growth stocks have outperformed due to second-wave concerns, while value stocks should rally when V-shaped recovery talk gains traction in the market. Additionally, a renewed move in cyclicals should lead to renewed outperformance by Europe and Japan, given the greater cyclical gearing of their indexes, Wood adds.\n\nDespite his optimistic outlook on the virus, Wood does not foresee widespread shutdowns in the future. This view was reinforced by President Donald Trump's recent tweet, stating that the U.S. economy will not be shut down again.\n\nIn other economic news, personal income slumped 4.2% in May, while consumption shot up 8.2%. The personal savings rate fell to a still high 23.2% from 32.2%.\n\nFriday marks the annual reconstitution day for the Russell stock-market indexes, typically one of the highest volume days for the year. The Federal Reserve has also conducted stress tests on big banks and is requiring large lenders to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and capping dividend payments.\n\nIn corporate news, Amazon is reportedly set to announce the purchase of self-driving car developer Zoox for $1.2 billion. Cannae Holdings and Senator Investment Group are offering $65 per share in cash for the 85% they don't already own in CoreLogic, the real estate data and analytics company.\n\nApparel maker Nike reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss on a 38% revenue fall, while close-out retailer Big Lots said sales were well ahead of expectations.\n\nThe Trump administration has urged the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

    " Title: Koch Network Launches Aggressive Campaign to Oppose Donor Disclosure Measure in South Dakota\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a move that marks the latest in a string of battles against efforts to disclose contributors' identities, a group tied to billionaire Charles Koch has launched an aggressive campaign to defeat a ballot measure in South Dakota that would require Koch-affiliated groups and others like them to reveal their donors' identities. The measure, known as Initiated Measure 22, calls for public disclosure of donors who fund advocacy efforts, the creation of a state ethics commission, and public financing of political campaigns.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity (AFP), the largest activist group in the policy and political empire founded by industrialist Koch and his brother, David, has formed a coalition called Defeat 22 to fight the measure. The coalition has already run commercials on talk radio and country-music stations, contacted 50,000 voters through phone calls and door-knocking, and distributed mailers denouncing the initiative as a money-grab by politicians.\n\nLuke Hilgemann, AFP's national CEO, cast the South Dakota fight as a battle to protect donors' free-speech rights. He argued that revealing donors' identities could subject them to threats and intimidation and drive them away from funding advocacy groups. \"The chilling of public discourse is a bad path for the country to go on,\" Hilgemann said.\n\nThe Koch network is one of the most influential groups in conservative politics. Some 700 like-minded donors each pledge to give at least $100,000 annually to a mix of educational, policy, and political organizations affiliated with the Kochs that push a small-government agenda. The network is on track to spend about $750 million during the 2016 election cycle, about a third of which will be directed to politics, officials say.\n\nA large share of the network's money flows through nonprofits whose donors are anonymous. Koch officials say preserving \"free speech\" is among their top priorities in the coming years. \"Wherever there are threats against the First Amendment, we will be there to weigh in,\" Hilgemann said.\n\nThe South Dakota measure would not bar donations to nonprofit groups active in politics, but it would require the groups running independent ads and distributing mailers to disclose the identities of anyone who gives more than $100 in a calendar year.\n\nOn the other side, Massachusetts-based Represent.Us, which is waging bipartisan campaigns around the country to end anonymous contributions in politics and pass laws it says will curb public corruption, is supporting the measure. Represent.Us and other advocacy groups helped successfully pass similar measures in Seattle and Maine last year. In addition to South Dakota, two more initiatives that deal with either campaign finance or lobbying issues are headed to voters this fall, in San Francisco and Washington state.\n\nBoth sides view South Dakota as an important test in a year when voter anger about the role of moneyed interests in politics helped buoy the White House candidacies of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Republican nominee Donald Trump. Republicans control the governors' mansion in South Dakota and both houses of the state legislature. A former GOP state senator, Don Frankenfeld, is helping run the \"Yes 22\" campaign in the state.\n\n\"If it can happen in South Dakota, it can happen in 10 or 20 other states,\" Hilgemann said. The early spending against the measure caught organizers by surprise, Frankenfeld said. \"We're scrambling now to mount an appropriate response to the misleading charge that it's a raid on the treasury for politicians.\"\n\nDefeat 22 has targeted a provision in the ballot measure that would give two, $50 \"democracy credits\" to every registered voter in the South Dakota. Candidates then could redeem those vouchers for taxpayer-funded money for their elections. The measure would cap the voucher program at $12 million, and candidates could not receive unlimited amounts from the state treasury. For instance, a legislative candidate would face a $15,000-limit on voucher funds.\n\nDefeat 22's literature says the initiative would let politicians spend taxpayer money on TV ads and robocalls \"instead of funding better roads and schools\" and urged voters to \"keep politics out of our pockets.\" The initiative's supporters say their internal polling shows strong support for the measure, which comes in the wake of a high-profile corruption investigation into state management of the federal EB-5 program, which grants green cards to wealthy foreigners who invest in South Dakota projects. A former state official has been charged in connection with the probe, and a former cabinet official, who was under investigation, committed suicide in 2013.\n\nFrankenfeld said his side has spent about $360,000, much of it focused on getting the initiative on the ballot. \"Will we be outspent by the Koch brothers? Probably,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic about the outcome, though. The Koch brothers have gotten our attention, but I'm confident we've got the better argument.\"",

The U.S. is sending a small team of military personnel to Abuja, Nigeria, in the coming days, led by logistics and communications experts from AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. The team will assess the situation and advise Nigerian officials, with no plans for a rescue mission, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren.\n\nThe French government has also pledged to send security service agents to help track down the Boko Haram terror group and its hostages. The group is believed to be hiding in the remote Sambisa Forest, an area eight times larger than Yellowstone National Park and filled with poisonous snakes.\n\nChina has offered satellite intelligence to aid Nigeria's army in locating the girls, and the U.K. plans to send a team of experts. The pledges of support come as parents of the kidnapped girls express mounting frustration over the government's response, with some parents so afraid they have stopped eating.\n\nThe Nigerian government is offering a $300,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, and the U.S. is offering a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his location. Local residents have reportedly pooled money for motorcycles to search for the missing girls.\n\nNigeria's government has faced criticism over its response to the kidnapping. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, said the Nigerian government has been \"somewhat derelict in its responsibility toward protecting boys and girls, men and women, in northern Nigeria in the last years.\" However, a senior adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called for greater international assistance in the country's fight against terrorism.\n\nIn recent days, Boko Haram has also raided villages in and around the forest, including a raid Monday night on a village near the border with Chad in which eight more girls were kidnapped. The hostages are being transported from one base to another to avoid detection.\n\nShekau, Boko Haram's leader, made his plans clear in a video released Monday, in which he gloated about the kidnappings and vowed to sell the girls into slavery. Shekau's army is estimated to number from a few hundred to a few thousand fighters. In recent days, Boko Haram also attacked the town of Gamboru Ngala on Nigeria's border with Cameroon, resulting in the deaths of at least 300 people.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Push Through Tax Break Extension and Confirm Judicial Nominees, but Fail to Pass Terrorism Risk Insurance Act\n\nIn a final flurry of accomplishment on Tuesday, lawmakers managed to extend a package of expired tax breaks and confirm 12 judicial nominees, marking a significant achievement for the Obama administration. According to NPR's Ailsa Chang, the confirmations resulted in President Obama getting 88 judges confirmed this year, nearly double the number from the previous year. The increase was largely attributed to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's decision to eliminate the filibuster for most judicial nominations in November.\n\nHowever, the extension of the tax breaks will only last until the end of 2014. Forbes quoted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) as saying the bill was \"quite literally the best we could do.\" Politico described the bill as \"a bill that nobody really wanted,\" referencing an earlier attempt by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to build a two-year extension, which was thwarted by the White House.\n\nThe Senate will need to work on a new plan for the tax breaks at the start of the new year. The failure to pass a bill authorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) was another disappointment for Senate Democrats. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) blocked a vote on the bill, effectively killing the legislation, as reported by The Hill.\n\nIn a positive note, President Obama signed the government funding bill on Tuesday, ensuring funding through September of next year, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, which is funded only through February. The Senate also confirmed several other of the President's nominations, including Anthony Blinken as Deputy Secretary of State and Vivek Murthy as the country's new Surgeon General, a position that had been vacant for 17 months.",
    " Title: FBI Rapidly Identifies and Apprehends Suspect in Nationwide Bombing Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a swift and unprecedented resolution, the FBI, in collaboration with other federal and state authorities, has identified and apprehended a 56-year-old Florida man, Cesar Sayoc, as the sole suspect in a series of partisan bombing attacks that captivated the nation for most of the week.\n\nThe breakthrough in the investigation came on Wednesday when two of the 13 un-exploded devices, one addressed to President Barack Obama and the other to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), were delivered to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis.\n\nInvestigators made a crucial discovery upon examination of the devices. A fingerprint was found on the padded manila envelope containing the device destined for Waters. By Thursday, investigators had matched the single print to Sayoc, a man with a lengthy criminal record in Florida.\n\nFurther examination of both the Waters and Obama devices revealed DNA among the components of the pipe-bombs, crudely constructed of six-inch PVC cylinders, small timers, batteries, wiring, and \"energetic material.\"\n\nLate Thursday night, federal investigators called on colleagues from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to compare the recovered DNA with existing samples taken from Sayoc in previous criminal cases. By Friday morning, federal authorities, just four days after the first device was found at the New York home of billionaire philanthropist and Democratic contributor George Soros, were ready to move in.\n\n\"This is phenomenal work, with the greatest pressure, under an incredibly tight time frame,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray at a Friday Justice Department briefing. \"We see unbelievable work like this on TV shows and in Hollywood, but to see it up close, in reality, is something to behold.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, who has been the target of blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, also commended the swift resolution of the case. \"This is a demonstration of the skill, the capability, and determination of our American law enforcement,\" Sessions said Friday.\n\n\"We've caught the right guy... It's exactly what the doctor ordered,\" said Wray.",
    " Title: Michigan Becomes 24th Right-to-Work State as Governor Signs Controversial Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked both celebration and protest, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed into law two controversial right-to-work bills on Tuesday. The legislation, which allows workers at union-represented employers to opt out of paying union dues, was passed by both the House and Senate, with both chambers dominated by Republicans.\n\nThousands of protesters, many of them union workers, gathered outside the statehouse, chanting and holding signs as snow fell. At least three school districts were closed as teachers traveled to Lansing to voice their opposition.\n\nMichigan, with a 17.5% union membership rate, would be the most heavily unionized state to pass such legislation. It would join neighboring Indiana in converting to right-to-work status this year.\n\n\"It would devastate the workers,\" UAW President Bob King told CNN Tuesday morning. \"We're worried about all workers in the state of Michigan.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that it will help attract businesses to the state, but critics contend that it will weaken labor's bargaining strength by cutting union financial resources without bringing in more jobs.\n\nAccording to Richard Hurd, professor of labor studies at the ILR School at Cornell University, employees in right-to-work states have lower wages, on average, than their counterparts elsewhere. This is because unions are weaker in those states and are less effective in bargaining for higher wages. On average, only two-thirds of workers join unions in right-to-work states.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning organization, reports that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less annually. The rate of workers covered by employer-sponsored health insurance is 2.6 percentage points lower, while pension coverage is 4.8 percentage points lower.\n\nRight-to-work states have seen employment expand by 8.2% between 2001 and 2010, according to State Budget Solutions, an advocacy group that supported the measure. In contrast, states without the law experienced a 0.5% decrease during the same period, according to the group's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.\n\nThe passage of the right-to-work legislation in Michigan symbolizes the declining fortunes of the nation's once powerful union movement. Only four states have passed right-to-work laws since the 1960s.\n\n\"If right-to-work passes in Michigan, it demonstrates the weakness of the labor movement,\" Hurd said. \"If it can happen in Michigan, there's a feeling it can happen anywhere.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Visit to Israel: A Moral Compass in the Arab-Israeli Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama lands in Israel this week, he is not stepping into a conflict zone akin to the Hatfields and McCoys. Instead, navigating the complexities of the Arab-Israeli conflict requires a steadfast commitment to principles of equality and freedom from racial and religious intolerance.\n\nThe Palestinian appeals will likely revolve around the emotive language of discrimination, focusing on Jewish settlements on Arab land and the \"apartheid walls\" surrounding them. Settlements are a contentious issue that has strained relations between the United States and Israel. In May 2009, Obama became the first U.S. president to demand a total settlement freeze as a prerequisite for progress, standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a press briefing. Israel responded with a unilateral moratorium on new settlement construction, but it expired in September 2010 without reciprocal action from the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe Palestinian political machine has seized every international platform to make settlements the central sticking point. The latest example is a new UN report from a \"fact-finding mission\" that investigates rights violations allegedly caused by Israeli settlements. However, the report's focus on settlements may mask a broader objective: the creation of an Arab state without Jews, often referred to as 'apartheid Palestine.'\n\nThe Middle East Road Map, endorsed by the Security Council in 2003, classified settlements as a \"final status\" issue to be \"negotiated between the parties\" because the ownership of the land and the longevity of settlements had not been determined. If negotiators decide that a particular territory will become part of a future Palestinian state, why should the current Jewish inhabitants be forced to leave?\n\nIsrael has a history of removing settlements under challenging circumstances. Israeli governments have included settlements in negotiations and stand ready to negotiate without preconditions. The argument that settlements are an impediment to peace is misguided, as the UN report demonstrates: it is rooted in anti-Semitism and the objection to any Jewish state.\n\nThe Human Rights Council's settlement report, currently celebrated in Geneva, begins with a timeline of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory dating back to 1948, not 1967. The report's pseudo-legal analysis criticizes \"Settlement Master Plans,\" language that echoes the Nazi SS chief Heinrich Himmler's \"deportation master plan.\"\n\nThe sources relied upon by the UN \"fact-finders\" include claims that Israel is intentionally polluting the territories to cause cancer and miscarriages among Palestinians and assertions that Israelis harbor \"racist beliefs of Jewish supremacy.\" The link between the anti-settlement campaign and the challenge to Israel's legitimacy is evident from the General Assembly's most recent fall session.\n\nLast November, 120 countries, including members of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement, led by Iran, denounced \"the racism of Israel and its settlers,\" \"Israel's racist, inhumane policies,\" \"the terror, violence, and provocations by extremist Israeli settlers,\" and declared, \"The era of Zionism is over.\"\n\nIn essence, the demonization and delegitimization of settlements are inextricably linked to the demonization and delegitimization of Israel itself. In March 2011, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered 3-month-old Hadas Fogel and her 11-year-old brother Yoav, along with their 4-year-old brother Elad and their parents, Ehud and Ruth, in a gruesome attack often referred to as the \"Itamar attack.\"\n\nIn January 2012, Palestinian Authority official television broadcast and re-broadcast a program in which family members of the convicted murderers, encouraged by the PA TV host, praised the attack. Facilitating the creation of apartheid Palestine is not a confidence-building measure. It will not produce a peace partner or foster a law-abiding future neighbor. Enabling apartheid Palestine should be anathema to every post-segregationist fiber in the American body politic, starting with President Obama.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses Countering Violent Extremism Summit, Reiterates Islam Does Not Represent Terrorist Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the closing session of the Countering Violent Extremism summit, hosted by the U.S. State Department in Washington, President Barack Obama reiterated that Islamist terrorist groups committing atrocities worldwide do not represent Islam. He cautioned that the notion that the West is at war with Islam is an \"ugly lie\" that should be rejected by all, regardless of faith.\n\nThe president emphasized the need for the international community to remain steadfast in the fight against terrorist organizations. He addressed delegates from over 60 countries, including those who have criticized the administration for not using the term \"Islamic\" when referring to terrorist groups such as al Qaeda, ISIS, and Boko Haram.\n\nObama explained that he avoids using the term \"Islamic\" when discussing terrorism to prevent Islamic radicals from using it as a recruitment tool. He stated, \"We must acknowledge that groups like al Qaeda and ISIS are deliberately targeting their propaganda to Muslim communities, particularly Muslim youth.\"\n\nThe president's refusal to acknowledge any connection between Islamic State terrorists and Islam has been met with criticism. Cliff May, president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, argued that the president and his administration should acknowledge that radical Islam is behind terrorism and groups like ISIS.\n\nMay stated, \"We're kind of avoiding making decisions now and we're saying things that really nobody that's informed about these matters can actually believe.\" He added, \"He [Obama] thinks he's doing it because he wants to avoid the impression that this is in any way a religious war \u2013 it was 21 Coptic Christians who had their heads taken off by the Islamic State.\"\n\nThe White House summit followed a recent, quiet meeting between the State Department and members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has sparked outrage from the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Zvi Mazel, former Israeli ambassador to Egypt, questioned the decision, stating, \"So how come, the United States, the administration, in that case the president himself and the State Department, receive a delegation of the Muslim Brothers?\"\n\nThe article concludes with a call for open and honest discussions about the root issues of terrorism, as Obama emphasized the importance of tackling these issues head-on.",
    " Title: U.S. Military's Mavni Program Faces Scrutiny as Recruit Vetting Process Delays Advancement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Military's Mavni program, designed to recruit immigrants with language skills and medical training, has faced increased scrutiny in recent years, leading to delays in the advancement of recruits. Since its inception in 2008, over 10,000 troops have joined the military through the program, primarily serving in the Army.\n\nRecruits, who are now subjected to extensive background checks similar to those required for troops with top-secret clearance, face screenings by the C.I.A., F.B.I., and a review of their financial history, among other rigorous measures. This added scrutiny has resulted in longer processing times, leading to a backlog of reviews in the thousands.\n\nMany recruits have been waiting for years to receive the clearances necessary for career advancement, with some cases seeing the initial screenings expire and needing to be repeated. According to immigration attorney and retired Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Margaret D. Stock, who helped create the program, soldiers have been discharged, even in the absence of security concerns.\n\n\"They were being discharged even if there was not a security concern,\" she said. \"These are often highly skilled individuals, many have master's degrees.\"\n\nIn a July court filing, government lawyers labeled the Mavni program an \"elevated security risk,\" citing instances of false information provided to obtain student visas and associations with foreign intelligence organizations among some recruits.\n\nHowever, a 2017 report by the RAND Corporation found no evidence that the Mavni program had caused any security problems. The report, yet to be officially released, found that the program's recruits were generally better educated and performed better than the average enlisted soldier, and had not been involved in terrorism or espionage.\n\nSome argue that the military may be seeking to curtail the Mavni program due to its administrative complexity and the numerous regulations associated with it. The program's future remains uncertain, as the U.S. Department of Defense continues to review its policies regarding immigrant recruitment.",
    " Title: House to Vote on Resolution to Block Trump's Border Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House of Representatives is set to vote on a resolution Tuesday aimed at blocking President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Friday.\n\n\"The president of the United States is declaring a national emergency to honor an applause line in a rally,\" Pelosi said during a conference call with reporters Friday morning. \"Not only is he disrespecting the legislative branch and the Constitution of the United States, he is dishonoring the office in which he serves,\" said the California Democrat, who spoke from the border city of Laredo, Texas.\n\nTrump announced the declaration last week as a means of freeing up billions to pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border after Congress failed to provide the money he demanded. Democrats have labeled the declaration an overreach of Trump's power and have vowed to fight it. Their resolution, if passed by both chambers of Congress, would terminate the emergency declaration. However, if Congress approves it, the president could veto it.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump vowed to veto the resolution \"100 percent.\" \"And I don't think it survives a veto,\" the president predicted.\n\nThe resolution is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House, but its future is uncertain in the Republican-held Senate. Unlike most legislation, the resolution is rooted in a provision from the National Emergencies Act that requires it to be voted upon within 18 calendar days after it is introduced and then be sent to the Senate.\n\nMany Republicans have expressed discomfort with the president declaring a national emergency to secure funding for a wall along the southern border, but it remains unclear whether they would vote for such an effort.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass the House, but its future is uncertain in the Republican-held Senate. However, unlike most legislation, the resolution is rooted in a provision from the National Emergencies Act that would require it to be voted upon within 18 calendar days after it is introduced and then be sent to the Senate.\n\nNormally, if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not want to bring legislation from the House to the floor, he can block it from getting a vote. But once this bill passes the House \u2013 which is expected to do so \u2013 the Senate will have to take it up within 18 days of receiving it.\n\nIn addition to the resolution, Pelosi on Friday did not rule out committee chairmen filing lawsuits over the wall. Sixteen states have already filed a lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that Congress had set aside for other purposes.\n\nThe House Democrats introduced the resolution Friday. As of Friday morning, it had more than 225 co-sponsors, according to lead sponsor Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas. The bill had one GOP co-sponsor, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.\n\n\"This is a historic power grab and it will require historic unity by members of Congress \u2013 Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative \u2013 to counteract the president's parasitic movement,\" Castro said. He and Pelosi said they were trying to recruit Republicans to sign onto the bill.\n\nThe fight over wall funding led to a 35-day government shutdown \u2013 the longest on record. White House officials have said the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers would free up an additional $6.6 billion, which would build at least 234 miles of border wall.",

    " Title: Trump Administration Steps Up U.S. Military Involvement in War on Terror\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the fifty days since President Donald Trump's inauguration, the new administration has begun to shape the contours of the war on terror, with a renewed focus on key regions such as Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, the U.S. has significantly increased its bombing campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen, following a late January raid. The Obama administration reportedly handed over plans for a stepped-up campaign to the incoming Trump team in January, and there has been an immediate change in the tempo of operations. The U.S. has now dropped more bombs on Yemen than in any previous year, with 34 of the 26,000+ bombs the U.S. was estimated to have dropped in 2016 attributed to Yemen.\n\nThe Trump administration's military decisions in Yemen appear to be untethered from much of the policy and bureaucratic deliberations that reportedly slowed down action during the Obama administration. The country has been embroiled in a civil war since rebels, allegedly backed by Iran, ousted the U.S.-backed government from the capital. Saudi Arabia has since led a military coalition to return the government of Abdrabbuh Hadi back to power.\n\nAl-Qaeda has benefited from the civil war, gaining territory with the help of a Saudi bombing campaign that, as Foreign Policy explains, is exclusively targeting the Houthi rebels. AQAP can fill the void, as they did when they took over the port city of Mukalla and began to collect millions of dollars a month in taxes and fees.\n\nThe Trump administration is also considering an increase in troop levels in the 15-and-a-half year war in Afghanistan, where the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has recently established a presence. Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in Egypt, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia, told the Senate Armed Forces Committee that a \"few thousand\" more troops above the 8,500 still deployed in Afghanistan were needed to break a \"stalemate\" with the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. is also reportedly deploying an additional 400 troops into Syria, almost as many as are currently there, ahead of the campaign to take Raqqa, ISIS' self-proclaimed capital. The U.S. is also deploying 2,500 additional troops to a staging base in Kuwait in support of the campaign against ISIS, although military leaders would not speak to the media about the plans for the troops.\n\nThe Iraqi government took no formal diplomatic action after it was included in President Trump's first executive order travel ban, instead lobbying members of the administration to be removed from the next version. Iraq's removal from the ban was also recognized as being motivated by its assistance in the campaign against ISIS.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to expand the use of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it a \"very fine place\" to hold unlawful enemy combatants, and suggested the military would decide whether to hold suspects there and whether and how to prosecute them. This shift is in line with the Trump administration's privileging of military decision-making priorities in the conduct of the war on terror.\n\nThe Trump administration inherited battlegrounds in the war on terror all over the world and, thanks to years of Congressional inaction, few limits to how to interpret the post-9/11 authorization of the use of military force (AUMF) which has been used since its passage as legal justification for military actions in places like Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq after the Iraq war-related withdrawal, against not just Al-Qaeda and \"associated forces\" but offshoots like ISIS which have become rivals. During the campaign, Trump suggested he would be open to some kind of Congressional vote on an AUMF specifically for ISIS, but despite a bipartisan push no such votes have yet materialized.",
    " Title: PolitiFact's Assessment of Hillary Clinton's Truthfulness Sparks Controversy Amid 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 election, fact-checking organization PolitiFact, run by the Tampa Bay Times, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage. However, the organization's credibility has come under scrutiny in the 2016 election, with concerns over its assessment of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's veracity.\n\nAccording to a recent NBC News poll, only 11 percent of voters described Clinton as \"honest and trustworthy.\" In stark contrast, PolitiFact's rating for Clinton's statements finds them to be true or mostly true half the time, half-true 22 percent of the time, and false or mostly false 26 percent of the time \u2013 but \"pants-on-fire\" false only 2 percent of the time.\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's rating was not as favorable. PolitiFact rated 19 percent of his statements as \"pants-on-fire\" false. Trump's cavalier approach to facts may account for his bad rating, but the same cannot be said for Clinton and PolitiFact's generous assessment of her veracity.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues surrounding Clinton's campaign is her decision to use a home-brew server for State Department emails. Clinton has repeatedly claimed that the decision was made for convenience, not to keep public information from public scrutiny. However, this assertion is false. Clinton did not disclose that she was the only secretary of state to exclusively use a private server, and she did not return all of her work-related emails to the State Department, as she claimed.\n\nPolitiFact rated the \"allowed\" assertion as \"false\" but not \"pants on fire.\" When Clinton said, \"I have now put out all of my emails,\" PolitiFact rated that statement as \"half true,\" and did not revise the rating later. It was not until Clinton told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that \"Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people,\" that PolitiFact gave Clinton a \"pants-on-fire\" rating on the subject.\n\nPolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan explained that the organization \"purposefully didn't rate statements that we couldn't verify.\" Once FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress, \"the factual record got much richer,\" and PolitiFact acted accordingly. Holan added, \"Our main goal here with the rating is not to punish or reward politicians, but to tell our readers what we know and what we don't know.\"\n\nPolitiFact never rated Clinton's public statements in which she linked an \"awful internet video\" with the Benghazi terrorist attack. Holan explained that it was not clear at the time if the statement was true or false.\n\nIn October 2012, on CNN, Clinton blamed the \"fog of war\" for her video remarks. CNN's Jake Tapper, however, determined for FactCheck.org that \"Hillary Clinton contributed to that false impression even though the State Department and Hillary Clinton seemed to know from the beginning that this was a terrorist attack.\"\n\nThis month, former President Bill Clinton went after Comey. The Washington Post fact-checker gave him three \"Pinocchios\" for \"a pathetic and misleading attempt to normalize Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email account and play down the fact that she was the only secretary of state to use a private server.\" PolitiFact did not comment on Bubba's attack on Comey.\n\nWhile PolitiFact's efforts to remain impartial are commendable, when its decisions lead to such glowing numbers for a candidate who can't seem to tell the truth, it has to rethink how it operates. When I look at Clinton's high truthiness score, I can't help but wonder if the verdict is \u2013 forgive me \u2013 rigged.",
    " Title: U.S. and Iraqi Government Address Tensions Over Islamic State Battle Amid Loss of Ramadi\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the Obama administration and the Iraqi government have escalated over the quality of Iraqi security forces, as the Islamic State continues to gain ground in the region. Vice President Joseph R. Biden attempted to reassure Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi on Monday that the U.S. stands behind the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe White House stated that Mr. Biden's phone conversation with Mr. Al-Abadi was aimed at reaffirming U.S. support for the Iraqi government's fight against the Islamic State. The vice president acknowledged the sacrifices and bravery of Iraqi forces over the past 18 months in Ramadi and elsewhere.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter's comments a day earlier, blaming the weak state of Iraq's military for the fall of Ramadi, have caused controversy. Carter stated that the Iraqi forces \"showed no will to fight\" and \"failed to fight, they withdrew from the site.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Al-Abadi, Saad al-Hadithi, said Monday that his government was surprised by Mr. Carter's comments. \"Carter was likely given incorrect information because the situation on the ground is different,\" Mr. al-Hadithi told The Associated Press. \"We should not judge the whole army based on one incident.\"\n\nMr. al-Hadithi stated that the Iraqi government believes the fall of Ramadi was due to mismanagement and poor planning by some senior military commanders in charge. He did not elaborate, nor has any action been taken against those commanders.\n\nGen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds forces in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, offered his own assessment of American forces. In Iran, the daily newspaper Javan, which is seen as close to the Revolutionary Guard, quoted Gen. Soleimani as saying the U.S. did \"not do a 'damn thing' to stop the extremists' advance on Ramadi.\"\n\nGen. Soleimani also questioned the U.S.'s commitment to fighting the Islamic State, stating, \"Does it mean anything else than being an accomplice in the plot?\" He added that Iran and its allies are the only forces that can deal with the threat.\n\nThe war of words over the loss of Ramadi, amid other gains by the Islamic State group in recent days, has laid bare the fissures among countries that have become allies of convenience against the militants. As Iraqi troops continue to flee their advance, governments across the world are questioning whether relying on Iraqi troops and militiamen on the ground alone will be enough to stop them.\n\nThe White House stated that Mr. Biden \"welcomed\" a decision by Iraq's Council of Ministers last week to mobilize additional troops and prepare for counter-attack operations against the Islamic State. The vice president pledged full U.S. support in these and other Iraqi efforts to liberate territory from ISIL.\n\nU.S. officials, including Mr. Carter, have stated that Iraqi forces fled the Islamic State advance on Ramadi without fighting back, leaving behind weapons and vehicles for the extremists. President Obama was also critical of Iraq's effort last week, stating that the loss of Ramadi was \"indicative that the training of Iraqi Security Forces, the fortifications, the command-and-control systems are not happening fast enough in Anbar, in the Sunni parts of the country.\"\n\nSo far, the American approach to the conflict has been to launch airstrikes as part of an international coalition it leads, as well as equipping and training Iraqi forces. Iran has offered advisers, including Gen. Soleimani, to direct Shiite militias fighting against the extremists. Iran has stated it does not have combat troops fighting in Iraq, though some Revolutionary Guard members have been killed there.\n\nBaghdad has stated that military preparations are underway to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in Anbar province, home to Ramadi, involving Iranian-backed Shiite militias. However, that possibility has sparked fears of potential sectarian violence in the Sunni province, long the scene of protests and criticism against the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.",
    " Title: \"Impeachment Inquiry: House of Representatives Faces Questions Over Lack of Formal Vote on Trump Investigation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, the House of Representatives has yet to vote on a resolution authorizing the investigation, a move that has sparked debate and confusion over the legitimacy of the process.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to House Democratic leaders stating it would refuse to participate in the inquiry, citing a lack of \"any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections.\" The White House also blocked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, from speaking with investigators from three House committees. President Trump tweeted that he would \"love\" to have Mr. Sondland testify, but the process was a \"totally compromised kangaroo court.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has shown little inclination to take such a step. \"If we want to do it, we'll do it. If we don't, we don't,\" Speaker Pelosi told the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week.\n\nThe question of when an inquiry into impeachment becomes an official impeachment inquiry is a crucial procedural matter. In the two presidential impeachments of the modern era, the House did have an official vote on a resolution authorizing the way ahead. However, House rules do not appear to require such a step, and it is not a common practice in impeachments of other officials.\n\n\"The Constitution is very clear about impeachment, but it is also not specific,\" says Matt Glassman, an expert on legislative procedure at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, in a recent podcast.\n\nTwo key questions arise from this procedural matter. First, why hasn't Speaker Pelosi put it to a vote? There are both political and procedural reasons why Speaker Pelosi might not want to hold an impeachment-opening vote, or see it as necessary. Drawing up such a resolution would be both difficult and politically risky. Democrats might find themselves divided over what to include.\n\nSecond, what are the implications of not having a formal vote? The lack of a vote could make the process appear less serious to voters and Republican officials. On the other hand, it could also provide more flexibility for the House to initiate the impeachment process in various ways, as outlined in the Congressional Research Service's overview of current House impeachment rules.\n\nThe impeachment process may be initiated as the result of various actions and events, including the receipt and referral of information from an outside source, investigations by congressional committees under their general authority, or the introduction of articles of impeachment in the form of a House resolution.\n\nThe White House has its own procedural and political reasons for demanding a vote \u2013 which mirror those of House Democrats. Republicans may want an impeachment vote to provide subpoena power to the House minority, allowing them to carry out a parallel investigation of the actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine, or to call witnesses they feel could debunk charges made against President Trump.\n\nIn the Nixon and Clinton cases, the kickoff vote did provide such authority to minority members. In practice, however, its impact could be limited, as the actual issuance of subpoenas would likely still be subject to full committee votes in which Democrats would triumph.\n\nThe GOP may also believe it can use this issue to raise doubts about the process in the eyes of voters. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California sent Speaker Pelosi a letter calling for impeachment to be put on hold \"until transparent and equitable rules and procedures are established.\"\n\n\"This is almost entirely about framing the narrative,\" William Howell, a professor of American politics at the University of Chicago, told the Los Angeles Times. The ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump continues to unfold, with the lack of a formal vote adding a layer of complexity to the already contentious process.",
    " Title: Intelligence Inspector General's Complaint Against Acting DNI Maguire: A Matter of Congressional Oversight and Executive Privilege\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire appeared before a closed-door meeting of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Maguire is scheduled to appear before the same committee in an open hearing next week, and leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have also indicated they expect him and the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson, to brief them next week.\n\nThe nature of the complaint remains unclear, but the incident underscores the importance of Congress' oversight role in matters concerning confidential hearings of such complaints. The Inspector General, not a disgruntled deep state actor, felt compelled to inform Congress about the matter, indicating its seriousness.\n\nThe administration's response to the complaint has raised questions about the interpretation and application of executive privilege. While Maguire has not invoked executive privilege as a reason for withholding the complaint, there is a strong argument to be made that he is disregarding the plain language of the law.\n\nAs the legal battle unfolds over who is authorized to withhold what from whom, two observations are worth noting. First, the intelligence community's watchdog, not a disgruntled deep state actor, was alarmed enough to inform Congress. Second, the administration appears to be taking steps to keep the complaint from becoming public, even in closed-door sessions.\n\nPresident Trump, in a series of tweets, dismissed the incident, questioning the credibility of the complaint. However, the President's history of withholding details of his conversations with foreign leaders, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and his casual revelation of Israeli classified intelligence to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office, casts doubt on his assertion.\n\nThree House committees are currently investigating whether President Trump attempted to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate business dealings of the son of the former vice president and current presidential candidate, Joseph Biden. They have requested a transcript of a July 25 phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The unfolding events serve as a reminder of the ongoing scrutiny of the President's actions and the role of Congress in ensuring accountability.",
    " Title: The Supreme Court Nomination Battle: A Battle for the Future of the Judiciary and the Constitution\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearings for President Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee have sparked a heated debate, with questions surrounding the nominee's judicial philosophy, approach to interpreting the Constitution, and stance on landmark Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Griswold v. Connecticut.\n\nWhile it is expected that nominees would not reveal their exact stance on these issues, the public has a right to know the nominee's views on these crucial matters. In the past, several justices, including Chief Justice Roberts, have provided insight into their judicial philosophy during their confirmation hearings.\n\nHowever, this time around, the hearings are not just about the nominee but also about the conservative legal activists at the Federalist Society, who have been instrumental in shaping the federal judiciary and redefining sections of constitutional law. During the 2016 campaign, President Trump published a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, preapproved by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two conservative groups.\n\nThe Federalist Society claims to uphold a strict construction of the Constitution, but this supposedly neutral mode of interpretation aligns suspiciously with Republican policy preferences, such as weakening laws that protect voting rights, loosening restrictions on political spending, undermining reproductive rights, and limiting the power of public-sector labor unions.\n\nSenate Democrats must use the confirmation process to educate Americans about the potential hijacking of the Constitution by a small group of conservative radicals, funded by ideological and corporate interests. This group aims to reshape the federal judiciary and redefine sections of constitutional law, potentially leading to the loss of rights and the invalidation of several laws over the next several decades.\n\nThe global movement against liberal democracy, as seen in countries like Hungary and Poland, underscores the importance of an independent judiciary. President Trump and Senate Republicans seem intent on riding this wave to unlimited power, but their victory will come at great cost to the nation and the court's remaining legitimacy.\n\nAmericans who care about the court's future and its role in the American system of government must turn to the political process to restore the protections the new majority will take away and to create an environment where radical judges can't be nominated or confirmed. As conservative activists would argue, winning the future depends on deliberate, long-term organizing in the present, even when things appear most bleak.",
    " Title: Davos Elites Face Criticism for Climate Change and Economic Inequality Commitments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, has been met with both praise and criticism this week, as business leaders and politicians gather to discuss global issues. The left applauds the focus on climate change and economic inequality, but worries that attendees will not match their words with actions.\n\n\"For companies to convince people around the world, especially the young, that capitalism is viable, business leaders need to show that they're making hard decisions,\" said one commentator. Already, there are concerns that new lower estimates for global growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could undermine some corporate commitment to climate-change initiatives.\n\nThe remaking of capitalism is an important and fragile undertaking, as some efforts to broaden the base of stakeholders may contribute to future growth, or at least not detract from it. However, the scale of the problems contemplated at Davos this week is likely to require more drastic intervention.\n\nThe harsher critics posit that the tension between President Trump and the Davos crowd is largely a war between intellectual fads, hiding a far more important commonality between the two sides. Both Trump and the Davos set share a basic assumption that business leaders and wealthy investors are the most important and valuable participants in economic life.\n\nRegarding the Treasury Secretary's comment about Greta Thunberg, some economists argue that a carbon tax is the gold standard of climate policy. A January 2019 letter signed by thousands of PhD-wielding economists, including more than two dozen Nobel laureates, all four living former Federal Reserve chairs, and Treasury secretaries and Council of Economic Advisers chairs from both parties, supports this view.\n\nThe current government is doing less than nothing to reduce emissions, even as it smugly lectures others about the need to listen to experts. It would genuinely be an incredibly constructive step for Mnuchin and other GOP leaders to listen to economists and espouse moderately aggressive, market-oriented solutions to the climate problem.\n\nFurthermore, the assassination of Iran's top military commander, Qasem Soleimani, has raised concerns about the potential for increased conflict in the Middle East. It is crucial that influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and Mitch McConnell remind President Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep President Trump from stumbling further into war with Iran.\n\nIn conclusion, the WEF in Davos this week has been met with both praise and criticism, as business leaders and politicians gather to discuss global issues. The remaking of capitalism is an important and fragile undertaking, and without some carrots and sticks, stakeholder capitalism will always be at risk of being a fad, an appeasement, as opposed to the deeper transformation it might become. It's crucial that influential leaders listen to experts and take action on climate change and economic inequality, and avoid stumbling into unnecessary conflicts in foreign policy.",
    " Title: The Bias of Political Media in Presidential Debates: A Historical Perspective and the Upcoming Clinton-Trump Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the leaves change color and the nation dives headlong into football season, the signs of election year autumn have become apparent. One such sign is the upcoming political media spectacle, the quadrennial fall classic, the presidential debates.\n\nThe political media and partisans have a long history of misjudging the first major presidential face-off, often confusing style with substance. This trend is evident in the 2008 and 2012 debates, where pundits like Mark Halperin and Eleanor Clift, in their eagerness to score ratings and clicks, often provided inaccurate assessments of the candidates' performances.\n\nIn 2008, for instance, Halperin criticized John McCain as \"Cluttered, jumpy, and often muddled,\" while giving him a surprisingly high grade of \"B-\". In the same debate, Halperin characterized Senator Obama as \"Polished, confident, focused,\" while being \"immersed in the past, present, and future details of policy.\" Oddly, Obama only received an \"A-\" grade for his performance that night.\n\nThe 2012 debate held more of the same kind of confusing misjudgment. While President Obama was detailed, patient, and reserved in the first debate that year, Mitt Romney was petulant, aggressive, and lied like a rug. Eleanor Clift even noted of that debate, \"Romney won on style and debating points...But Obama, for those who paid attention to what he said, stuck more closely to the facts.\" However, holding to that obvious truth wouldn't score the ratings and clicks that the denizens of the national media need.\n\nSo after setting Romney's expectations low and Obama's high, the President's long fact-filled answers only helped the team of beltway BS-ers score their pre-game narrative that Romney won. Like a fullback trying to burrow his way through a pile of defensive linemen, they clung to the narrative they'd already set, and drove the idea of Romney's win into the history books. But facts matter. If the debate were a football game, a clear and honest call of that contest would have said that Obama won an extremely low-scoring match, merely because he didn't penalize himself into oblivion with lies like Romney.\n\nWhich brings us back to this weekend, the impending expectations game between Clinton and Trump, and the inability of the pandering pundits and the political zealots to admit the obvious. Many of them are already planning to juice the score for Donald Trump in his first presidential debate, by grading his performance on a severe curve, while they set the bar for her victory much higher.\n\nIt should surprise no one that Trump and his surrogates have already been \"working the refs\" before Monday's match. As Greg Sargent noted on Thursday, Trump clearly is already warning Lester Holt, the debate moderator - along with the rest of the nation - that Trump won't be held to things like real-time fact checks. Clinton's camp did their own working of the refs recently, after Matt Lauer's embarrassing impersonation of a journalist at the recent presidential town hall forum. The difference in how each side played the refs, as Sargent also noted, is that most Clinton supporters seem to want a fair playing field, where both candidates are judged by the same rules.\n\nThat, by the way, is exactly what every American who cares about the election should do Monday night: Apply the same set of rules to BOTH candidates, regardless of each one's previous experience. Both Clinton and Trump are selling their life experiences as equal reasons to think they're qualified to be president. With that in mind, any member of the media who tries to grade either on a curve is exposing themselves as a biased referee, who should simply be ignored.\n\nIn politics as in sports, any competitor can win, on any day. The similarities don't end there. In politics, as in sports, there are also rules for competing fairly. Each candidate must follow those rules honestly. Provable lies are penalties - sorry spin doctors. Each candidate also must obey the clock, and each must make their points with style - but even more importantly, with substance. Being president isn't just about playing to a crowd or a camera. Finally, no matter who wins the debate, as Elizabeth Drew wrote, just because one candidate is judged to have won the debate is no reason to automatically hand them the presidency.\n\nRegardless of how most of the political media treats it, being the President of The United States is not a game - which means judging which candidate is more successful in communicating their policies by the end of Monday's debate won't really be a game either.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Signals 2020 Ambitions Amidst Trump Administration Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private meeting with Al Hubbard, a top economic advisor from the Bush administration, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Marty Obst, reportedly discussed preparations for a potential 2020 presidential run, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. However, both Pence and his aide, Obst, have denied any such insinuations, with Obst calling suggestions of positioning for 2020 \"beyond ridiculous.\"\n\nVice President Pence has maintained a public facade of loyalty towards President Trump, but his aides have been more candid in private conversations. In a June meeting with Hubbard, Obst reportedly expressed a desire to be prepared for any potential opening in 2020 and sought Hubbard's assistance. Hubbard declined to comment when reached for this article.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence's advisor, Nick Ayers, has signaled to major Republican donors that Pence is readying himself for a potential future run.\n\nIn an effort to establish his own identity, Pence has been actively engaging with key Republican figures and events. He spoke at Senator Joni Ernst's annual pig roast, a significant gathering for Iowa Republicans, and held a separate, more intimate donor event afterward. Upon arriving in Des Moines on Air Force Two, Pence was greeted by an Iowan who had criticized the Affordable Care Act, who also happened to be a member of the state Republican central committee.\n\nFurthermore, Pence has used his residence at the Naval Observatory as a platform for relationship building. In June, he opened the mansion to social conservative activists, including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, and representatives of the billionaire Koch brothers.\n\nAs the 2020 election approaches, the vice president's actions suggest a careful balancing act between maintaining loyalty to the current administration and positioning himself for a potential future run.",
    " Title: White House and Congress Remain at Impasse on Student Loan Issue as Obama Visits UNLV for Campaign Fundraiser\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a multimillion-dollar campaign-fundraising trip, President Barack Obama visited the University of Nevada at Las Vegas on Thursday to call on Congress to act on the issue of student loans. The president urged Congress to prevent interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans from doubling on July 1.\n\nThe president has been pushing for a solution to this issue for over a month, but the White House has remained silent on recent Republican offers to break the impasse. On May 31, Republican leaders in Congress sent several proposals to pay for the $6 billion cost of subsidizing student loans. However, administration officials have been virtually ignoring these offers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, criticized the president for not responding to the Republican proposals and accused him of delaying a solution to fit in a few more campaign rallies with college students while pretending someone other than himself is delaying action.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is working with Congress, but he said Republican leaders have resisted solutions prior to sending the letter last week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, offered a \"bipartisan\" proposal to resolve the student-loan issue, which includes changing the formula by which employers calculate their pension liabilities and increasing employers' premiums for insurance provided by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nThe speech on student loans at UNLV was the president's only \"official business\" on his two-day trip aboard Air Force One, along with five campaign fundraisers in California that netted him well over $5 million. The president's campaign is expected to reimburse the government for the cost of a first-class commercial airline seat for each person flying on Air Force One to or from a political event.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the president for trying to exploit the student-loan deadline to curry favor with young voters, whom he needs to energize for the November election. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \"Unfortunately, the president is more interested in campaigning for the students at UNLV then actually working with Congress to find a solution.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Governing Takes Center Stage in Virginia and New Jersey Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's election results in Virginia and New Jersey have turned traditional political norms on their head, as columnist Ramesh Ponnuru points out in the New York Post. The conventional wisdom that Republicans win in red states and Democrats in blue states seemed to hold little weight in the marquee battles in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nIn Virginia, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a conservative Republican, lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe despite expectations that he would perform better than Republican Governor Chris Christie in his reelection bid in New Jersey. The reasons for Cuccinelli's loss are complex, but they include personality, the legacy of the Republican administration, and significant financial backing for McAuliffe.\n\nPersonality played a significant role in Cuccinelli's defeat. He was portrayed as a right-wing Republican, with his positions on gay marriage, abortion, and social issues used relentlessly against him in ads throughout the growing North Virginia suburbs. Cuccinelli was also running against the legacy of the Republican Governor Bob McDonnell's administration, which was plagued by allegations of corruption and a growing ethics scandal.\n\nIn contrast, McAuliffe was able to run as a mainstream centrist Democrat despite his liabilities. He used economic issues to make the case that he would offer an alternative to the status quo in a state that has suffered from increased unemployment and slower than average economic growth.\n\nIn New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie was reelected with a significant margin, running as a bipartisan governor who worked with Democrats in the legislature and famously with President Obama on Hurricane Sandy relief. The picture of the two men embracing after the storm is indelibly etched in the minds of most New Jerseyans and, arguably, most Americans. This helped President Obama in 2012 and it almost certainly helped Governor Christie this year with Democratic leaning groups -- groups he won significant levels of support from.\n\nThe common principle that links the victors in both races is an emphasis on bipartisan governing. Both Christie and McAuliffe have understood that in this environment, it is critically important for governors, and elected officials, to work across the aisle and the ideological divide to work in a bipartisan way. The two candidates who were best able to do that \u2013 Chris Christie and Terry McAuliffe \u2013 have accomplished it, and those efforts are arguably as responsible for their wins as anything else that may have happened.\n\nAs someone who has championed bipartisan governing throughout my entire career, Tuesday's wins for McAuliffe and Christie are certainly a bright spot in an overly partisan and polarized America.",
    " Title: Hackers Breach North Korea's Government-Run Twitter and Flickr Accounts Amidst Rising Tensions on the Korean Peninsula\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 In a surprising turn of events, hackers apparently infiltrated at least two of North Korea's government-run online sites on Thursday, as tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe North's Uriminzokkiri Twitter and Flickr accounts, known for their typical content, which includes photos of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un meeting with military officials, ceased to post such content. Instead, a picture posted on the North's Flickr site depicted Kim's face with a pig-like snout and a drawing of Mickey Mouse on his chest. Beneath the image, the text read: \"Threatening world peace with ICBMs and Nuclear weapons/Wasting money while his people starve to death.\"\n\nAnother posting read \"We are Anonymous,\" against a black background. Anonymous is a well-known hacker activist group. A statement, widely circulated online, claimed that the hackers had compromised 15,000 user records hosted on Uriminzokkiri.com and other websites. The authenticity of the statement could not be confirmed, but the North's official website did not open on Thursday.\n\nTweets on the North's Twitter account read \"Hacked\" followed by a link to North Korea-related websites. One tweet said \"Tango Down\" followed by a link to the North's Flickr page.\n\nNorth Korea established its Twitter account in 2010 and has over 13,000 followers. The North uses social media to praise its system and leaders and also to repeat commentaries sent out by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nTensions have been high in recent days between North and South Korea, and the North's military warned on Thursday that it had been authorized to attack the U.S. North Korea is reportedly upset about sanctions against its nuclear program and joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea.",
    " Title: House to Vote on $1.1 Trillion Spending Bill, Averting Government Shutdown and Default\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote Wednesday on a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will fund the federal government through October, ending, for the time being, the partisan battles that led to a government shutdown and threatened a potential U.S. default on its bills.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the GOP-led House is expected to pass the 1,582-page bill Wednesday, though many Tea Party conservatives are expected to oppose it. A Senate vote is anticipated by the end of the week, with the Democratic-led chamber also expected to pass the plan.\n\nNPR's Ailsa Chang told our Newscast Desk that the bill \"fleshes out the broad outlines provided in last month's budget agreement on Capitol Hill.\" The budget authorizes spending \"for nearly every speck of government within the guidelines of last month's budget agreement.\"\n\nOne notable difference between this bill and the December deal involves cuts to military pensions. The budget agreement announced last month reduced the annual cost-of-living increases for military retirees under 62 by one percent. This spending plan reverses that cut, but only for disabled veterans and relatives of deceased members of the military.\n\n\"The measure eases across-the-board spending cuts by providing an extra $45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014, to a total of $1.012 trillion,\" Bloomberg News reported. It also provides an additional $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding that is typically handled off-budget.\n\nFunding runs through Jan. 15, Wednesday, so lawmakers also plan to pass a separate three-day stopgap bill at current funding levels to push the deadline to Jan. 18. This would give lawmakers enough time to enact the comprehensive legislation without risking a government shutdown. The House plans to vote on the three-day measure today.\n\nAs for the politics of all this, The Hill reports that the bill \"is a compromise between the two parties, with both sides giving up some of their priorities to reach a deal.\" The bill \"includes some concessions to both parties, such as increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, but also includes cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Internal Revenue Service.\"",
    " Title: The Case for Decriminalizing Drugs: A Call to End the War on Drugs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a society where courts are overwhelmed, innocent individuals are pleading guilty to avoid lengthy trials, and overcrowded prisons are costing a fortune, one solution to these problems has emerged: End the war on drugs. The United States government has spent trillions of dollars in an attempt to curb drug use, yet the results have been dismal. More people are using drugs today than before the war on drugs began.\n\nNeuroscientist Carl Hart, former chair of Columbia University's Psychology department, argues that the war on drugs has only increased conflict between law enforcement and citizens, as he explains in a new video. Hart, who grew up in a tough Miami neighborhood, witnessed the devastating effects of crack cocaine on his community. However, his research revealed that the evidence did not support the damage drugs inflict.\n\nAfter 20 years of research, Hart concluded, \"I was wrong.\" He now believes that our drug laws do more harm than drugs themselves. The illegal nature of drug sales leads to massive profits, which in turn leads to gun violence and the formation of gangs. While cigarettes harm people, there are no violent cigarette gangs, and there were no longer violent liquor gangs after prohibition ended.\n\nThe opioid epidemic is another issue that Hart attributes to the drug war. While opioids are legal, their sale is tightly restricted, leading to tainted opioids and overdoses. Hart suggests that if drugs were over-the-counter, there would be fewer deaths.\n\nDrugs, including nicotine and heroin, make people feel better, according to Hart. He knows many people who use drugs, including public officials and captains of industry. He believes that the focus on fatal car crashes in the automobile industry is similar to the focus on drug-related deaths in the drug war.\n\nPresident Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex. America's drug war funds a prison-industrial complex, according to Hart. He spent years inside the well-funded research side of this complex and found that any research not in support of the \"tough-on-drugs\" ideology is routinely dismissed to \"keep outrage stoked\" and funds coming in.\n\nAmerica locks up more than 2 million Americans, a higher percentage of our citizens, disproportionately black citizens, than any other country in the world. Hart argues that in every country with a more permissive drug regime, all outcomes are better. Countries like Switzerland and Portugal, where drugs are decriminalized, \"don't have these problems that we have with drug overdoses.\"\n\nIn 2001, Portugal decriminalized all drug use. Instead of punishing drug users, they offer medical help. Deaths from overdoses dropped sharply. In 2017, Portugal had only 4 deaths per million people, while the United States had 217 per million.\n\nHart concludes, \"In a society, you will have people who misbehave. But that does not mean you should punish all of us because someone can't handle this activity.\" The war on drugs, he argues, is not the solution to the problems it was intended to solve. Instead, it is time to end the war on drugs and focus on providing medical help to those who need it.",
    " Title: The Cost-Effectiveness of Cracking Down on Visa Overstays and Employer Compliance: A Perspective on Border Control and Immigration Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate on border control and immigration enforcement, a significant focus has been placed on the construction of a border wall. However, a closer examination of the issue reveals that cracking down on visa overstays and employers who hire illegal workers may be a more cost-effective approach to improving immigration enforcement.\n\nSince 2005, the federal government has invested heavily in border security, adding hundreds of miles of walls and fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, doubling the size of the Border Patrol, and increasing spending on border enforcement to levels surpassing other law enforcement activities combined. This rapid expansion has been marked by duplicative programs and a point of diminishing return, as indicated by the federal government spending more on immigration enforcement than on drug trafficking, gangs, counterfeiting, identity theft, financial fraud, and other law enforcement activities.\n\nWhile physical barriers play a significant role in border security, a major expansion of existing barriers should be considered in the context of a cost-benefit analysis. The estimated number of undocumented immigrants has decreased from 12.2 million in 2007 to slightly over 11 million today, due to increased enforcement, declining birth rates, and improving economies, particularly in Mexico. However, it is estimated that 35% to 50% of the inflow is individuals who enter the country legally and overstay their visas, a group not impacted by walls or other border control efforts.\n\nPresident Trump's proposed border wall and his insistence on Mexico paying for it have been met with criticism, as they threaten to strain relations with an important ally and trading partner. The proposed 20% tax on imports from Mexico to recoup construction costs would likely trigger a mutually destructive trade war, effectively making U.S. consumers bear the cost.\n\nIn light of these factors, it is argued that cracking down on visa overstays and employer compliance with hiring practices would be a more cost-effective approach to improving immigration enforcement. By addressing the issue of visa overstays, the government could significantly improve its immigration enforcement efforts without the need for additional spending on steel and concrete.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff. Most editorials are coupled with an opposing view \u2014 a unique \u2588\u2588\u2588 feature.",
    " Title: Minneapolis City Council Vows to Replace Police Department with Public Safety System\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic move towards police reform, the Minneapolis city council has declared its intent to disband the city's police force and replace it with an alternative system of \"public safety.\" This decision comes in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May.\n\nThe city council's decision follows a series of largely peaceful protests across the United States and around the world, sparked by Floyd's death. Over the past few weeks, more than 10,000 protesters have been arrested, many for non-violent offenses.\n\nThe move towards disbanding the police force is part of a broader effort to address systemic racism and police brutality in the United States. The Obama administration introduced measures to impose accountability on police forces after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. However, the Trump administration's Department of Justice has allowed these incremental efforts to wither, leading to growing support for a more radical solution: \"defund the police.\"\n\nThe families of Tamir Rice, Oscar Grant, and other black Americans killed by police have expressed their anger and hope in response to Floyd's death. The phrase \"I can't breathe\" has resonated with protesters worldwide, as it speaks to both the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and the implacable nature of institutional racism.\n\nMeanwhile, the fashion world has forgotten Willi Smith, the most high-profile black fashion designer of the 1980s. Smith, who invented streetwear and whose label was grossing $25 million a year before his death from AIDS in 1987, has been largely overlooked in the annals of fashion history.\n\nIn other news, the government of Brazil has stopped releasing its numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and wiped an official website clean of information, reportedly on the orders of President Jair Bolsonaro.

    " Title: Violence Erupts During Peaceful Unity March in Eastern Ukraine's Donetsk\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a peaceful march advocating for Ukrainian unity in the eastern city of Donetsk was disrupted by pro-Russian separatists, leading to chaos, fireworks, and physical altercations on the city's main boulevard.\n\nThe demonstrators, who had only walked about half a mile down the city's main thoroughfare, were met with a mob of masked men, armed with clubs, who attempted to block the road. Fireworks and homemade bombs were thrown from the crowd, prompting the separatists to retaliate with stones and physical attacks using their weapons.\n\nRiot police, who had been trailing the marchers, moved in to intervene, clashing with the attackers and attempting to separate the two sides. One member of the mob was reportedly hit in the head with an exploding homemade bomb, and a police officer was also injured in a blast.\n\nMarchers scattered in all directions, with members of the pro-Russian mob pursuing them down the street. One man, with a gash on his head and bleeding, flashed a simple peace sign as he walked away to seek help.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, an ambulance crew was treating the wounded, where we encountered a Ukrainian journalist with a bloody bandage on his head, who told us he was attempting to flee when he was hit by a brick.\n\nThe demonstration had begun peacefully, with many of the marchers waving the sky blue and gold flags of Ukraine, singing patriotic songs, and chanting slogans of unity. Throughout the day, pro-Russian separatists had been rallying on social media to oppose the march.\n\nThree weeks ago, separatist gunmen occupied the main administration building in Donetsk and have since turned it into a heavily fortified command center in their bid to carve out an independent republic with strong ties to neighboring Russia. Donetsk lies at the heart of one of Ukraine's volatile breakaway eastern provinces, and, as today's events demonstrate, it is simmering on the brink of all-out civil war.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Officials Face Challenges in Tracking Extremists Amidst Divergent European Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. intelligence officials are grappling with the task of monitoring American and European-born fighters who travel to the Middle East to join Islamic extremist groups like ISIS, due to differing approaches to information sharing and homeland security from their European counterparts, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report highlights that U.S. officials are finding it difficult to trace the movements of suspected extremists once they enter certain European countries. This challenge arises despite the close intelligence links between U.S. and European security services, with intelligence from both sides of the Atlantic bolstering terror watch lists maintained by U.S. officials, such as the no-fly list.\n\nA significant point of contention among U.S. intelligence officials is a series of anti-terror proposals made last week by British Prime Minister David Cameron, particularly his proposal to revoke the passports of British nationals who have traveled to fight for ISIS. U.S. counter-terrorism officials have reportedly expressed reservations about this move, arguing that confiscating passports could prevent individuals who have traveled to Syria and Iraq from communicating with authorities and providing intelligence about the situation on the ground.\n\nThe Journal's report is corroborated by a report in The Times of London, which suggests that up to 30 British-born ISIS fighters have grown disillusioned with the militants' brutal tactics and wish to return home, but are hesitant due to the punitive measures advocated by Cameron.\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama is set to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss his plan to counter the ISIS threat. Details of Obama's plan are scarce ahead of his Wednesday address to the nation, though the New York Times reported on Monday that the White House is planning a three-phase campaign that some Pentagon officials believe could take at least three years to fully execute.\n\nThe U.S. has already carried out nearly 150 airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and The Times reported that the final phase of the campaign would involve the extension of airstrikes into Syria, where ISIS maintains its base.\n\nThe Obama administration is also exerting pressure on allies to align firmly against ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia and Jordan to meet with Mideast leaders and assess their level of commitment to a growing worldwide coalition. The Associated Press reported that Kerry has been pressing a core group of 10 countries to form a loose coalition to target last week's NATO summit. In addition to the United States, the coalition includes the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Turkey, Italy, Poland, and Denmark.\n\nAs he deliberates his next move, Obama is seeking advice from a diverse group of foreign policy experts, including former national security advisers from the Obama, George W. Bush, Clinton, and Carter administrations, as well as Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass and former Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell.\n\nIn a call on Monday, Obama congratulated new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi for the approval of a new government. The White House stated that al-Abadi \"expressed his commitment to work with all communities in Iraq as well as regional and international partners to strengthen Iraq's capabilities\" to fight the Islamic State militants.\n\nObama also spoke with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on the need to continue addressing the ongoing threat from the Islamic State and to thank Australia for its contributions to humanitarian air drops in northern Iraq, according to the White House.",
    " Title: White House Shifts Focus to Economic Recovery as CDC Releases Guidelines for Reopening Businesses\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released new guidelines for the safe reopening of businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations as states gradually lift their coronavirus restrictions. The recommendations, which are still subject to revision, offer advice on how to reopen various types of entities, including schools, restaurants, religious facilities, and workplaces.\n\nThe CDC has put together \"decision trees\" for at least seven types of organizations, including schools, camps, childcare centers, religious facilities, mass transit systems, workplaces, and bars/restaurants. The new guidance, which could be revised before the Trump administration unveils it to the public, is intended to help businesses and organizations safely reopen amid the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn the initial reopening phases, schools should space desks six feet apart, nix any field trips and school assemblies, and have students eat lunch in their classrooms instead of the cafeteria. Churches should hold services through video streaming or at drive-in or outdoor venues as much as possible, and encourage everyone to wear cloth face masks. Restaurants should consider using throwaway menus, single-service condiments, and disposable forks, knives, spoons, and dishes. They should also install sneeze guards at cash registers, limit the number of employees on a shift, and avoid having buffets, salad bars, and drink stations.\n\nThe guidance for religious groups includes providing congregants spiritual and emotional care \"on a flexible or virtual basis or refer them to other available resources.\" The CDC also recommends that religious organizations provide hand sanitizer and encourage social distancing.\n\nAllen Fagin, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said that as much as worship in synagogues is \"one of the most fundamental aspects of Jewish life,\" his faith also believes that \"the sanctity of life is more important than any other aspect of observance.\" Fagin added that the application of any guidelines is likely to have significant regional and demographic variation.\n\nVarious trade groups have also started coming out with their own recommendations. For example, the National Restaurant Association last week put out guidance to restaurants considering reopening. The association said restaurants should clean and sanitize reusable menus, while the CDC suggests using disposable menus. And the CDC recommends that employees use cloth masks when interacting with customers, but the association doesn't. But some guidance is similar. The association and the CDC both recommend seating dining parties at least 6 feet apart.\n\nLarry Lynch, a senior vice president at the trade group, said the restaurant industry is already heavily regulated in order to prevent foodborne illnesses. So he doesn't think additional guidelines from the CDC are onerous. \"The fact is we're probably already 80% of the way there with the mandates coming out of the food code,\" he said.\n\nLynch said the biggest concern for restaurant owners isn't federal guidelines, but convincing people that it's safe to return to restaurants. Many companies, especially those with strong remote work capabilities, are already drawing up plans that go beyond the CDC's guidelines, said Bhushan Sethi, global people and organization leader at PwC, a consulting firm.

    " Title: David Brock Assumes Leadership of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, political strategist David Brock has taken over as chairman of the board for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a prominent watchdog group known for its non-partisan approach to government accountability.\n\nBrock, who has been a vocal supporter of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, was elected last week, marking a move that aligns liberal interests more closely with the Democratic Party. The new leadership aims to transform CREW into a more assertive and potentially partisan organization, according to sources familiar with the transition.\n\nUnder Brock's leadership, CREW will undergo a multifaceted expansion, aiming to establish a more politically oriented arm, broaden its focus into state politics, and enhance donor targeting. The restructured CREW will operate in close coordination with Brock's growing fleet of Democrat-backing nonprofits and super PACs, including Media Matters, American Bridge, and the American Independent Institute.\n\nBrock confirmed the changes in an interview, stating, \"CREW gives us some potentially powerful tools in the toolbox. We have been in the accountability for 10 years very successfully. It is kind of a one-stop-shop now.\"\n\nIn addition to these changes, a new overtly partisan watchdog group, The American Democracy Legal Fund, is being formed. This group, run by Brad Woodhouse, president of American Bridge, will operate under section 527 of the Tax Code, allowing it to engage in more political activity than CREW's traditional portfolio. CREW, which has operated as a nonprofit under section 501 (c) 3, will add a new, more politically oriented arm registered under section 501 (c) 4.\n\nFounded in 2003 by former federal prosecutor Melanie Sloan and white-collar lawyer Norm Eisen, CREW has built a reputation for its relentless pursuit of litigation and ethics complaints against public officials, primarily Republicans. Notable achievements include playing a significant role in the Jack Abramoff scandal and the downfalls of powerful GOP Reps. Tom DeLay and Bob Ney during the Bush administration.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Sloan, who continues to serve as CREW's executive director, the group has maintained a reputation for its unwavering commitment to accountability, regardless of party affiliation. CREW's annual \"Most Corrupt Members of Congress\" report, which began in 2005, has included 25 Democrats among its 88 featured members. The group has also called for the resignations of embattled New York Democratic Reps. Anthony Weiner and Charlie Rangel and has pending requests for investigations into the Obama administration, including its use of private emails for government affairs.\n\nThis shift in leadership may signal a more partisan approach for CREW, although the group's commitment to accountability and non-partisanship remains a key part of its mission.",
    " Title: Trump Warns Protesters Ahead of Tulsa Rally, Cites Increased Security Measures Amidst Coronavirus Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump warned protesters planning to disrupt his first campaign rally in months in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday, stating that the event would be handled differently than in cities like New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. The president's tweets came as the city prepares for the rally, which was initially scheduled for Juneteenth but was later rescheduled due to pressure from activists.\n\nTrump's tweets read, \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!\" It remains unclear what specific actions Trump may take to carry out his threat, but his tone towards protesters has grown increasingly hostile in recent weeks.\n\nThe president has previously blamed the antifa movement for violence at protests without evidence and has boasted about the National Guard's handling of protesters in Minneapolis, comparing it to a \"knife cutting butter.\" Tulsa's mayor, G.T. Bynum, imposed a curfew beginning Thursday night and into the weekend, citing concerns about organized groups coming to the city. However, the curfew was later rescinded.\n\nTrump's rally is expected to draw as many as 100,000 supporters, with some attendees lining up outside the 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center days before the event. The president claimed that over a million people had requested tickets for the event, and his campaign has been exploring possible venues for an overflow crowd.\n\nThe city of Tulsa is also tense due to its history as the site of a race massacre in 1921, in which as many as 300 black residents were killed by whites. Concerns about the rally go beyond race, as Oklahoma is still battling the coronavirus and has seen a recent uptick in cases.\n\nIn another tweet on Friday, Trump referred to the Tulsa rally as the re-launch of his reelection campaign, stating, \"Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn\u2019t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!\"\n\nOklahoma's Republican Governor, Kevin Stitt, backed the rally during a meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday, assuring that the event would be safe despite concerns from health officials about the potential spread of the coronavirus. Trump, in turn, praised Oklahoma's handling of the pandemic as one of the reasons for choosing the state for the rally.\n\nThe Trump campaign spokesperson, Erin Perrine, told ABC News that the campaign is taking precautions to ensure the safety of rally-goers, including checking attendees' temperatures and providing them with face masks and hand sanitizer. The rally is set to take place on Saturday, June 20.",
    " Title: Critique of WHO's Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Sparks Debate on Funding and Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has faced criticism from the left for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly its perceived deference to China. However, calls for drastic measures such as cutting its funding during a global health crisis are met with skepticism.\n\nThe WHO's praise for China's response to the pandemic has left many exasperated, with some arguing that the organization is in a difficult position due to its limited budget and the sensitivities of its member states. The WHO sought to maintain access to important data and findings from Wuhan, China, a major donor and a significant supporter of the organization's current director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nPresident Trump's criticism of the WHO, while highlighting a valid issue, is seen as misguided, according to experts. The danger lies in the potential misinterpretation of Trump's message. His detractors may overlook the need for a critical examination of the WHO's priorities, decision-making structure, and funding to improve the organization's credibility and ability to respond to future crises. Meanwhile, his supporters may be led astray by Trump's finger-pointing, failing to learn from the U.S.'s own failures and believing that blame lies elsewhere.\n\nAmanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, points to the WHO's low budget and relatively weak structure as a deeper problem. Unlike the International Atomic Energy Agency, the WHO has no means to enforce cooperation from non-compliant governments. 'It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments,' Glassman said.\n\nDisagreements with the WHO should not lead to its discrediting or withdrawal of support. The global community still needs an authoritative body that sets standards, collates, and studies all pieces of the COVID-19 puzzle from affected countries. The WHO, like the United Nations itself, is in need of reform, but it is not the time to dismantle the agency leading the global response. If not the WHO, then who?\n\nTrump's criticism of the WHO, particularly his early praise for China's handling of the pandemic, has been noted. Early on, the WHO was not as harsh on China as it perhaps should have been, and this was not due to a lack of U.S. support. The WHO is an organization made up of its member states, and to forcefully take on one of those members, such as China, requires the backing of the others. No major world leaders at the time were urging the WHO to confront China, and without such backing, the WHO is unable to act independently.\n\nIn conclusion, the WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked debate, with calls for reform and increased scrutiny of the organization's priorities and structure. However, the timing and manner of such criticism should be carefully considered, as the global community still relies on the WHO for coordinated responses to future health crises.",
    " Title: Potential Pitfalls and Promises in the Upcoming Republican Immigration Reform Proposals\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation awaits the introduction of a Republican immigration reform bill, or bills, there are several key issues that need to be addressed to ensure a fair and comprehensive solution. One of the primary concerns is the path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. While the principles of any potential legislation rule out a \"special\" path to citizenship, they do not exclude the possibility of eventual naturalization. The details of this process, however, remain unclear.\n\nRepublicans are advocating for significant fines and other penalties for undocumented immigrants, as well as the meeting of enforcement benchmarks as a condition for legalization. This is coupled with the mandatory national expansion of the E-Verify hiring database and a new entry-exit visa system. However, new layers of enforcement should not be so onerous as to prevent immigrants from leaving the shadows. Increased powers for states and localities to enforce immigration laws, potentially leading to racial profiling and other abuses, have no place in any bill.\n\nReforms to legal immigration are also crucial, with visas for farmworkers, high-skilled workers, and others necessary to ease crushing backlogs that discourage millions overseas. The Republican proposals must be expansive enough to address these issues and create a more accessible path for legal immigration.\n\nIn the meantime, deportations continue, with the Obama administration having expelled nearly two million people since 2009. As Congress struggles to reach a consensus, there is a question of whether President Obama will take administrative action to protect these individuals, as he has already done for a relative handful of unauthorized youths through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe road to comprehensive immigration reform has been long and fraught with obstacles. The hopeful days of bipartisan Senate legislation in 2013, which ultimately failed due to a Republican filibuster, are a distant memory. Now, as Republicans, traditionally advocates of self-deportation and Arizona-style laws, appear to be edging closer to supporting legal status for millions of the undocumented, it remains to be seen whether this is the first step back toward the rational, humane reform that should have passed years ago.",
    " Title: House Approves Short-Term Funding Extension for DHS, Long-Term Bill Remains Controversial\n\nThe House of Representatives has approved a one-week extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), following a day of intense negotiations and a failed attempt to pass a three-week stopgap measure. The President signed the one-week bill into law.\n\nThe contentious issue of including a push-back on President Obama's executive action on immigration in a longer-term funding bill remains unresolved, with the Senate and House still at odds. The fresh deadline to resolve the impasse is fast approaching.\n\nAccording to NPR's Ailsa Chang, speaking on Weekend Edition Saturday, the strategies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner were not in sync, leading to tension between the two chambers. House Republicans reportedly resented being pressured by the Senate to pass a long-term funding bill, which is one reason they opted for a shorter-term bill.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) stated, \"When we're at the end of next week, what do we do?\" He expects the House to align with the Senate's bill funding DHS through September without immigration changes. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has made no commitment, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expects the one-week measure will provide the necessary time to pass a funding measure covering the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nBoehner's allies are concerned that his critics within the Republican Conference may attempt to oust him as speaker if he puts a long-term DHS funding bill on the House floor next week. While Boehner dismisses such speculation, close friends believe such a move is a real possibility.\n\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against Boehner for speaker on the floor in early January, signaling his ongoing problems with his conservative hardliners. Ailsa Chang notes that Boehner has a vocal and determined contingent of conservatives in his caucus who are not afraid to challenge him, a group that has grown larger since the election. More than 50 Republicans voted against Boehner's first plan on Friday.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Leadership Vacuum: Clinton's Public Remarks Draw Criticism from Party Insiders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Party finds itself in a state of flux, with former President Barack Obama largely out of the public eye and the surprising defeat of Hillary Clinton leaving a void in leadership. Amidst this political landscape, Clinton's recent public remarks explaining her election loss and criticizing the Democratic National Committee have drawn criticism from within the party, with many Democrats expressing concern that her comments are hurting the party and making her appear bitter.\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, interviews with more than a dozen Democrats, including staunch Clinton supporters and former aides, revealed a consensus that Clinton needs to rethink her public blaming tour. One longtime aide, reflecting on Clinton's appearance at the Recode conference in California, expressed frustration, stating, \"Good God, what is she doing? She's apparently still really, really angry... It's not helpful to Democrats. It's not helpful to the country, and I don't think it's helpful to her.\"\n\nFormer Obama aides have also expressed confusion over Clinton's strategy, with one former senior aide stating, \"If she is trying to come across as the leader of the angry movement of what happened in 2016, then she's achieving it. But part of the problem she had was she didn't have a vision for the Democratic Party, and she needs to now take a break and let others come to the forefront.\"\n\nClinton's criticisms of the DNC can make it tougher for new leaders to emerge, according to the former Obama aide. \"It's hard to do that when you have the former nominee out there in a newsy, aggressive manner,\" the aide said.\n\nWhile Obama has made public appearances since leaving office, he has generally refrained from talking about Trump. Instead, he has held events focused on getting young adults active in civic engagement. This approach is in line with the tradition of past presidents who have generally avoided public criticisms of their immediate successors.\n\nAs the Democratic Party grapples with its leadership vacuum, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez are emerging as potential leaders. However, Sanders is not a member of the Democratic Party, and Perez is still adjusting to his leadership position after winning his post in a contest with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).\n\nAs the 2020 presidential race approaches, it remains to be seen how Clinton's public remarks will impact the party and her own political future. Some Democrats believe that Clinton will continue to discuss the election, particularly to promote her upcoming book, which is expected to be published this fall. However, the strategy behind these public appearances remains unclear, with some suggesting that Clinton's comments are more of a personal strategy rather than a political one.\n\nIn conclusion, the Democratic Party is facing a leadership vacuum following the 2016 election, with former President Obama largely out of the public view and the surprising Clinton defeat leaving a void in leadership. Clinton's recent public remarks explaining her election loss and criticizing the Democratic National Committee have drawn criticism from within the party, with many Democrats expressing concern that her comments are hurting the party and making her appear bitter.

    " Title: President Trump Urges West Virginia Voters to Oppose Don Blankenship in Senate Primary, Citing Unwinnable General Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, President Donald Trump has appealed to Republican primary voters in West Virginia to oppose former coal baron Don Blankenship in the upcoming Senate primary, stating that Blankenship \"can't win the general election\" in the state.\n\nIn an early-morning tweet on Monday, Trump urged voters to choose either Attorney General Patrick Morrisey or Rep. Evan Jenkins instead. The president's tweet aims to prevent a potential loss in the general election against Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in November.\n\nThe primary election is set for Tuesday, and Blankenship's parole from a year-long prison sentence for conspiring to violate mine safety laws in connection with the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010 that killed 29 workers is set to end on Wednesday, the day after the election.\n\nOver the weekend, Morrisey announced plans to have Blankenship disqualified from the race for failing to submit a financial disclosure, a violation of election law. Morrisey stated, \"My campaign will be informing his probation officer in Nevada about this issue right away, to determine if this refusal to comply with federal law violates the terms of his supervised release.\"\n\nBlankenship's campaign has promised to release financial details following a primary win. Blankenship also responded to Trump's tweet, expressing confidence that \"we're still going to win\" and asserting that the president may not understand West Virginia politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Morrisey has employed \"robo-calls\" to potential voters, stating, \"Convicted criminal Don Blankenship didn't vote for President Trump and is a resident of Nevada, where he must report to his parole officer.\"\n\nBlankenship has campaigned as an outsider against the Washington establishment, but his tactics have drawn comparisons to GOP candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama special election race amid allegations of sexual misconduct, ultimately flipping the seat blue for the first time in decades.\n\nBlankenship has also been accused of running racially charged ads in recent weeks. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has also spoken out against Blankenship, citing the Moore example.\n\nIn addition to West Virginia, primary elections will be held in North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana on Tuesday, ahead of the midterms. Trump won each of the four states in the 2016 presidential race.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling Establishes Right to Unanimous Jury Verdicts in State and Federal Courts\n\nIn a landmark decision on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to a unanimous jury verdict in both federal and state courts. The ruling overturned the conviction of Evangelisto Ramos, who is serving a life sentence in Louisiana for a 2016 murder conviction following a 10-2 jury vote.\n\nThe 6-3 vote marked a significant shift in the court's interpretation of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to a speedy and public trial, an impartial jury, and the right to confront witnesses. The court's decision continues a trend in which the court has held that protections in the Bill of Rights that originally applied only to the federal government also apply to actions by state governments.\n\nLouisiana and Oregon have long since renounced the racist underpinnings of their non-unanimity rule. However, the court's decision is important because it ensures that most of the significant protections of the Bill of Rights \u2014 the ones dealing with personal liberty \u2014 do apply to the states. This is not just a legal nicety, but a fundamental right that must be upheld to ensure that there is no daylight between the two when it comes to basic rights.\n\nThe court's ruling is particularly significant in light of the high exoneration rate in Louisiana, which has the second-most exonerations per capita in the United States. The city of New Orleans, in particular, has an exoneration rate almost 10 times the national average and almost 64% higher than the second-most exonerated city.\n\nThe court's decision is also important because it addresses the issue of non-unanimous jury verdicts' disproportionate impact on black defendants and black jurors. According to a 2018 report from the New Orleans Advocate, black defendants in Louisiana were 30% more likely to be convicted by a split jury decision. When jurors don't have to agree on a decision, jury members with strong dissenting opinions are effectively silenced, and this happens more frequently to black jurors in some parishes.\n\nJustice Alito pointed out in Monday's dissenting opinion that Louisiana and Oregon now face 'a potential tsunami of litigation' as defendants seek new trials for convictions that weren't decided unanimously. However, this crush of appeals signifies something valuable\u2014it's proof of the necessity of today's ruling. The sheer fact that there could be so many people denied a fair and just trial is exactly what made today's majority opinion so important, and for too many, so overdue.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling to establish a right to a unanimous jury verdict in state and federal courts is a significant step towards ensuring fair and just trials for all defendants. The ruling addresses the disproportionate impact of non-unanimous jury verdicts on black defendants and black jurors and is a testament to the court's commitment to upholding the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.",
    " Title: President Obama to Address Counterterrorism Strategies Amidst Rising Fears of Terrorist Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate growing concerns regarding terrorism, President Obama will dedicate a significant portion of this week to discussing his strategies for countering the influence of the Islamic State (IS) militant group, both domestically and internationally.\n\nIn the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, the president has adopted a more reassuring tone, urging Americans not to succumb to distrust and fear. \"Terrorists like ISIL are trying to divide us along lines of religion and background,\" Obama stated in his weekly address on Sunday, using an acronym for the extremist group. \"That's how they stoke fear. That's how they recruit.\"\n\nHowever, for an escalating number of Americans, these fears are not mere speculations, given the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. A Press-GfK poll from January revealed that 5 in 10 Americans believed the risk of a terrorist attack in the United States was high. A new survey indicates that this number has risen to 7 in 10, despite government assurances that there are no credible threats to the US.\n\nIn an effort to publicize the government's counterterrorism efforts, the president has planned a series of high-profile visits to the Pentagon and the National Counterterrorism Center this week, before departing for his annual two-week family holiday in Hawaii.\n\nThe December mass shooting in San Bernardino has raised questions about the US government's ability to identify lone-wolf radicals who may have been inspired by Islamic State. The US government has been successful in intercepting would-be terrorists who have been in contact with terrorist recruiters online, but the fact that the shooters in the San Bernardino attacks managed to remain under the government's radar until they killed 14 people at a health department holiday party has fueled concerns that the government may not be doing enough.\n\nThe recruitment strategies employed by IS, including an online approach that focuses on inspiring lone attacks, have forced US intelligence officials to engage in a multi-front war, from the Middle East to social media.\n\nPresident Obama will commence the week with a National Security Council meeting at the Pentagon, followed by a public update about the US strategy against Islamic State. On Thursday, Obama will visit the National Counterterrorism Center, which analyzes intelligence to stay informed about recruiting methods and other information on terrorist groups. Obama is scheduled to address reporters after a briefing at the suburban Virginia facility.\n\nThese visits are seen as countermeasures to the increased fear over terror attacks, both in the public and in the widely-viewed presidential election campaigns. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the US, a suggestion that the president has alluded to in public comments urging Americans to remain united.\n\n\"We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam,\" Obama said on Sunday.",
    " Title: Clinton-Sanders Healthcare Debate: A Closer Look at the Single-Payer Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heated race for the Democratic presidential nomination, a contentious debate has arisen between front-runners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over healthcare policies, with Clinton accusing Sanders of wanting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) through the implementation of a single-payer healthcare system.\n\nThe controversy stems from a bill introduced by Sanders in 2013, which proposed a national single-payer system. The bill would have required each state to establish its own single-payer program, with a federal board overseeing these state programs and taking charge of any that failed to meet certain requirements. Federal programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP, would have been integrated into these state-run systems.\n\nWhile Sanders' bill shares some similarities with Obamacare, it was designed to be more progressive, ultimately rendering it politically untenable in Congress. The Clinton campaign's assertion that Sanders' single-payer plan would allow states to opt out entirely is, according to many, a misrepresentation of the proposal.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been aggressively pushing this attack throughout the week, with Chelsea Clinton even taking to the campaign trail to criticize Sanders' plan for allegedly stripping millions of people of their health insurance. This aggressive approach has sparked criticism from some quarters, with many viewing it as a desperate move to regain momentum after a series of polling setbacks.\n\nThe debate between Clinton and Sanders on healthcare policy serves as a microcosm of the broader Democratic Party's struggle to find a unified platform on this critical issue. Some see value in this debate, as it allows the party to refine its healthcare goals ahead of the general election. However, it is essential to remember that, regardless of the proposals put forward by either candidate, the current Congress, and the powerful lobbying forces that influence it, present significant obstacles to enacting major healthcare reforms.\n\nUltimately, the next Democratic president will likely face the challenge of preserving the Affordable Care Act from Republican attempts to repeal it, with efforts to expand or amend the law likely to come later, contingent on the composition of Congress or changes within the Republican Party. The healthcare debate between Clinton and Sanders, while passionate and divisive, is just one piece of a larger, complex puzzle that will require careful navigation to achieve meaningful healthcare reform.",
    " Title: Texas Authorities Pursue Adult Trial for Ethan Couch, Missing Teen Involved in Fatal Drunk-Driving Accident\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas authorities have announced their intention to seek an adult prison sentence for Ethan Couch, the teenager who famously used the \"affluenza\" defense in a 2013 drunk-driving accident that resulted in the deaths of four people. Couch and his mother, Tonya Couch, were taken into custody by Mexican authorities in Puerto Vallarta on Monday, nearly two weeks after Couch failed to appear for a probation appointment.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, authorities outlined potential legal options for the state to pursue. Couch is scheduled for a court hearing on Jan. 19, where the district attorney will motion to move the juvenile case to adult court. The juvenile judge will make the final decision on where the case will be heard.\n\nCouch and his mother were located and arrested by Mexican authorities on a road in Puerto Vallarta. Couch, who was previously known for his blond hair, was found with brown hair, but authorities were able to make a positive identification.\n\nAuthorities believe the two planned their escape, with Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson stating, \"They even had something that was almost akin to a going-away party before leaving town.\" Anderson also announced that an arrest warrant would be issued for Tonya Couch on charges of hindering an apprehension.\n\nCouch's attorneys, Scott Brown and Reagan Wynn, have stated they will not comment on the case until they speak with their client, which is unlikely to happen before Couch returns to the United States. The two are currently being held at immigration offices in the state capital, Guadalajara, and are expected to return to the United States aboard a commercial flight to Houston on Tuesday.\n\nMexico's Jalisco state prosecutors' office stated its agents had been working with American authorities since Dec. 26 to track down and capture Couch and his mother. They were found in a less affluent section of Puerto Vallarta's old town, far from the city's glitzy resorts, golf courses, and high-rise hotels.\n\nCouch was driving drunk and speeding on a dark two-lane road south of Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV off to the side, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in Couch's pickup truck. He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. Because of his age, he was not certified as an adult for trial, and a judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a rehabilitation center.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service had issued a wanted poster promising a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to Ethan Couch's whereabouts and capture.",
    " Title: McAuliffe's Campaign: A Testing Ground for Clinton's Presidential Ambitions, Yet Focus Remains on Virginia\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe's gubernatorial campaign is serving as a testing ground for potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's influence and organization. Despite Clinton not publicly commenting on her political future, McAuliffe's campaign is attracting attention from high-profile Clinton associates, raising speculation about the potential connection between the two.\n\nMcAuliffe, a close ally of the Clintons, has stocked his campaign with key personnel likely to be involved in any potential Clinton presidential bid, including campaign manager Robby Mook, senior adviser Patrick Hallahan, and bundlers such as Jonathan Mantz and Jackson Dunn. The campaign has also raised significant funds, with nearly $2 million in March alone at out-of-state fundraisers featuring former President Bill Clinton or other Clinton insiders.\n\nHowever, McAuliffe's campaign and its surrogates have officially discouraged the perception that it is a Clinton farm team. Some Clinton insiders privately express reservations about suggestions by McAuliffe's allies that his campaign will pave the way for a potential Clinton run. It remains unclear whether Clinton has endorsed McAuliffe's fundraising pitches, with her focus currently on her husband's campaigning and fundraising efforts.\n\nThe potential 2016 discussion could complicate McAuliffe's message in his tight race against Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. McAuliffe has sought to portray himself as a moderate Virginia businessman, rather than the Washington money man with close ties to the Clintons.\n\nJames Carville, the longtime political strategist and Clinton loyalist, stated that McAuliffe is using his connections in Clinton World to build his campaign, but emphasized that McAuliffe has his own political base. Carville, who recently hosted a fundraiser for McAuliffe in New Orleans, stressed that McAuliffe's campaign is not being presented as a Clinton effort-in-waiting.\n\nAnother McAuliffe fundraiser in Georgetown last month raised $170,000 from a group of longtime Clinton allies and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with the event resembling a potential Clinton kitchen cabinet. The event, held at the Washington home of Harold Ickes, a top strategist on Clinton's 2008 campaign, was co-hosted by Ickes' lobbying partner and fellow Clinton White House veteran Janice Enright, former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and his lobbying partners, as well as McAuliffe bundlers and Clinton loyalists. The invitation described McAuliffe as \"a mentor to all of us... now it is time to elect him governor.\"\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race approaches, the focus remains on McAuliffe's campaign in Virginia, with the success or failure of his campaign serving as a measure of Clinton's strength and organization in a critical swing state.",
    " Title: BD Shifts Manufacturing to Mexico Amidst Potential U.S.-Mexico Tariffs: Economists Warn of Potential Disruptions to Supply Chains\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could signal a broader trend among U.S. companies, BD, a medical technology company, announced last month that it was relocating some of its manufacturing from China to Mexico, citing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for BD, confirmed on Friday that the company was still in the process of transitioning, involving diagnostic devices and other products, and was evaluating the latest tariff announcement.\n\nPresident Trump announced on Thursday evening that he would impose a 5% tariff on Mexican imports starting June 10, with the potential for the tariff to increase to 25% by October if immigration issues were not resolved. The immediate impact of these tariffs could be felt by consumers, particularly in the fresh produce sector, where distributors may have little choice but to pass on the increased costs.\n\n\"As a consumer, that was my first thought,\" said Emily Blanchard, an economist at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. \"Those are my avocados and strawberries. What are you doing?\"\n\nFor other products, the effects could be more gradual. Companies may initially absorb some of the costs to avoid losing business, particularly on higher-margin items or those where they face competition from domestic producers. However, economic research shows that consumers eventually bear the brunt of tariffs. The impact could be greater in the case of trade with Mexico because many imports from there contain parts or materials from American factories.\n\n\"We're taxing ourselves on our own goods,\" said Katheryn Russ, an economist at the University of California, Davis.\n\nEconomists suggest that the direct effects of a 5% or even 10% tariff would likely be minimal, especially with a strong economy and low inflation. The larger threat, they warn, is the disruption these tariffs could cause for automakers and others who have come to rely on supply chains that seamlessly cross international boundaries. These supply chains may not disintegrate overnight, but over time, they could break down, particularly if companies decide they cannot trust trade rules to be consistent from one year to the next.\n\n\"It's the cumulative effect of all this uncertainty,\" said Brian Dunch, a trade expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"You'll see supply chains Balkanize.\"",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Struggles in States with High Income Inequality Despite Campaign Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been losing in states where income inequality is worse. This counterintuitive trend is particularly pronounced in the states where income inequality is highest, with Hillary Clinton winning these regions.\n\nThe latest example of this trend is the New York primary, where Clinton's victory has further solidified the pattern. Sanders' campaign, which is built on addressing income inequality, has not resonated as much in the most unequal states.\n\nTo illustrate this trend, a chart of all 50 states' Gini index, a widely used statistic that measures income inequality, has been provided. The states are lined up from left to right, from the most equal (Alaska, at 0.4146, or 0.455 from the median) to the most unequal (New York, at 0.5048, or 0.447 from the median).\n\nThe pattern is clear: Clinton wins in the most unequal states, while Sanders wins in the most equal states. Even in the one fairly equal state Clinton won - Iowa (the lonely, farthest-left green bar) - she barely won, and even then only among \"state delegate equivalents,\" not voters.\n\nIt's important to note that the margins of error in this data are small, and while the difference from one state to the next may not be significant, the difference between one state and a handful of places away generally is. The broader trends are also meaningful.\n\nThere are several factors that may be contributing to this trend. One possibility is that race plays a role, as the South is both heavily unequal and heavily black. American blacks in general are more economically disadvantaged than whites nationwide, due in part to what the Brookings Institution calls \"deep-rooted, systemic problems.\"\n\nAnother factor could be Sanders' explicit appeal to rural voters through his gun control stances, which may have helped fuel his performance in states with larger rural populations.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Sanders hails from Vermont, the 11th most equal state, while Clinton, who won New York (the most unequal state), claims it as her home state.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bernie Sanders' campaign has focused on income inequality, he has not been able to break through in the states where income inequality is worst. This trend is complex and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including race, rural populations, and geographic location.",
    " Title: Schumer Criticizes Trump's Nominees, Calls for Transparency in Cabinet Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized President-elect Donald Trump's nominees during a press conference on Wednesday, labeling the cabinet picks as a \"swamp cabinet\" due to their backgrounds in banking and business.\n\nSchumer expressed concern over the lack of transparency in the nomination process, citing the incomplete paperwork for some nominees, particularly Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Education. He warned that if Democrats feel Republicans are rushing nominees, they will force \"extensive debate\" on the Senate floor, potentially slowing down the confirmation process.\n\nSchumer also suggested that Republicans should block Rep. Mick Mulvaney from leading the Office of Management and Budget due to his failure to pay taxes on a household employee. This reference was a comparison to the 2009 withdrawal of Tom Daschle's nomination for Health and Human Services over similar tax issues.\n\nMulvaney has since paid the $15,000 in taxes, as well as penalties, and the Trump team has dismissed the criticism, stating that Mulvaney has already taken \"appropriate follow-up measures.\"\n\nThe Senate is currently negotiating the number of nominees who will receive a vote before the full Senate on Friday. The threat of extended debate could potentially slow down the Republicans' efforts to confirm the nominees.",
    " Title: Jack Lew's Confirmation Hearings: A Test of Credibility and Fiscal Policy Expertise\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Jack Lew, President Obama's nominee for Treasury Secretary, prepares for his confirmation hearings, questions about his past, fiscal policy knowledge, and his role in the 2008 financial crisis loom large. In his testimony before the Senate Budget Committee in 2011, Lew stated, \"It's an accurate statement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt... We've stopped spending money that we don't have.\" This statement, however, has come under scrutiny as Lew's budget blueprint, if implemented, would add $13 trillion to the federal debt.\n\nLew's tenure at Citigroup, a bank that received a government bailout, and his role in the accumulation of bad mortgage debt that led to the 2008 financial crisis are among the issues that will be raised during the hearings. Senators will also question Lew about his decision to shelter his wealth in the Cayman Islands and his stance on offshore tax havens, a topic that has been a point of contention in the past.\n\nIn addition to these personal and financial questions, Lew will face inquiries about the administration's fiscal policy and the mounting federal debt. If confirmed, Lew will be responsible for issuing bonds to finance an expected $4 trillion in additional borrowing during President Obama's second term.\n\nThe hearings will also provide insight into the president's fiscal policy, as negotiations over the next fiscal crisis are ongoing. With the across-the-board spending cuts agreed to in the 2011 debt-limit deal, Lew's answers will shed light on the president's stance on the issue.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has accused Lew of \"deliberate artifice\" for claiming that Obama's fiscal plan would lead to balanced budgets. This allegation, if proven, could potentially derail Lew's nomination.\n\nThe hearings are expected to be a test of Lew's credibility and fiscal policy expertise. If confirmed, Lew will move from a career in budgeting to a role in policy and power, a significant shift in responsibilities. The stakes are high, and Lew will need to navigate the complexities of Washington politics with care.",
    " Title: USDA's Sugar Market Intervention: A Costly and Complicated Loop\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's focus on the potential impacts of sequestration has been a hot topic, with concerns over White House tours and border patrol agents often at the forefront. However, a less-discussed issue is the federal government's role in propping up certain special interests, such as the agricultural sector.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) manages a plethora of farm-and-rural programs and subsidies that, in practice, function as corporate welfare for agribusiness. One of the most significant consequences of this government intervention is the artificial manipulation of the American sugar market, which benefits a select few farmers at the expense of the economy as a whole.\n\nThe federal government has implemented complex loan programs, import barriers, and production quotas to artificially inflate domestic sugar prices. This means that not only are taxpayers footing the bill to protect domestic sugar producers from free-market competition, but consumers are also paying higher prices as a result.\n\nThe USDA's persistent interference in the sugar market has led to a vicious cycle. According to a USDA economist, Barbara Fecso, the department is likely to purchase sugar in the domestic market this year to drive prices up and prevent defaults on loans made to sugar processors. The USDA estimates it would need to buy 400,000 tons of sugar to boost prices to an \"acceptable level.\" This would amount to about 4.4% of projected U.S. sugar production in the marketing year that ends on September 30.\n\nTo encourage ethanol producers to buy the sugar, the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation is expected to sell it at a loss of about 10 cents per pound, totaling $80 million. According to Ms. Fecso, if the USDA acquires sugar in a down market, it will lose money, regardless of how it is disposed of. If sold to ethanol producers, at least the USDA would be getting something in return for it.\n\nIt is indeed generous of the USDA to determine the \"acceptable level\" of sugar prices on behalf of the American public, disregarding the economic ripple effects. This interventionist approach to the sugar market is a prime example of the unintended consequences of government intervention in the free market.",
    " Title: Study Highlights Concerns Over Declining Role of Facts in Public Life\n\nA new study, \"Truth Decay: An Initial Exploration of the Diminishing Role of Facts and Analysis in American Public Life,\" by Michael D. Rich and Jennifer Kavanagh of the Rand Corporation, raises concerns about the increasing skepticism and disagreement about facts in society. The study attributes this trend to the rise of social media, the internet, cable television, and talk radio, which have led to a torrent of information that is difficult for individuals to distinguish from opinions.\n\nThe study identifies four trends that are harmful to fact-based discourse and policymaking: increasing disagreement about facts and their interpretation, the blurring of the line between fact and opinion, the increasing quantity of opinion relative to facts, and declining trust in formerly respected sources of factual information. The volume and velocity of the information flow, combined with the ability to curate personalized information, erode society's assumption of a shared set of facts.\n\nThe authors also highlight the impact of cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, which lead individuals to seek and receive only congenial facts. They also point out that living in echo chambers, caused by factors such as gerrymandering, assortative mating, and geographic segregation, produces polarization.\n\nThe study suggests that new media technologies exacerbate cognitive biases and promote the permeation of partisanship throughout the media landscape. The authors propose a range of solutions, from teaching critical reasoning in schools to supporting long-form and investigative journalism with public money. However, their main purpose is to suggest research projects that will yield facts about the consequences of the new media and intellectual landscape.\n\nThe study also notes that unjust distrust is regrettable, but distrust of the untrustworthy is healthy. The authors caution against the spread of truth decay due to the rise of safe spaces on campuses and simple mendacity, such as the claim that Lincoln was a member of the National Union Party rather than the Republican party.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of fact-based discourse and policymaking in society and the need for research to understand the consequences of the new media and intellectual landscape.",
    " Title: Romney and Ryan Accuse Obama Administration of Inconsistency in Libya Attack Explanation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint interview with running mate Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney has accused the Obama administration of failing to provide a clear and honest account of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, which resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Ohio, Romney stated, \"We expect candor from the president and transparency, and he continues to refuse what is said by the other members of his administration: This was a terrorist attack. We were attacked apparently by Al Qaeda, and it is a very troubling development.\"\n\nRomney's comments echo complaints made by Republican lawmakers who question the administration's shifting explanation, starting with claims that the September 11 strike was \"spontaneous\" violence tied to protests over an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. Obama officials have gradually walked back that description, and Obama acknowledged Monday that it \"was not just a mob action.\"\n\nOne of Obama's advisers, National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen, was more direct last week, testifying to Congress that the four Americans \"were killed in the course of a terrorist attack.\"\n\nRyan added, \"When the director of the Counterterrorism Center comes to Congress and testifies and says that this is a terrorist attack... I think you would want to ask that question of the president, why he is not on the same page with his own administration officials?\"\n\nObama devoted much of his address Tuesday to the United Nations General Assembly to the attack in Libya and unrest in the Mideast. He paid tribute to Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the attack, recalling Stevens' time serving in the Peace Corps as an English instructor in Morocco.\n\nThe president went on to restate his administration's support for the Arab Spring, calling it a \"season of progress.\" But he said the recent violence and unrest is indicative of the difficulties along the way. \"True democracy -- real freedom -- is hard work,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Obama did not mention terrorism in his U.N. speech, and he has yet to elaborate on how extremists were able to launch what now appears to have been a coordinated attack on the consulate. Obama and others in his administration have been criticized by Republicans for not taking a more definitive stance on the attack.\n\nObama, in an interview taped Monday on ABC's \"The View,\" condemned extremist elements in the Muslim world and vowed the U.S. is \"not going to shrink back from the world because of this.\" He also said in the interview that there was \"no doubt\" that the assault \"was not just a mob action\" but a sign of extremism in nations lacking stability.\n\nIn interviews and at campaign events Monday, Romney assailed Obama's leadership abroad, leading a chorus of Republicans in criticizing the president for what they said was minimizing the death of the Ambassador Stevens. Obama, in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" said recent violence in the Mideast was due to \"bumps in the road\" on the way to democracy. Romney on Monday also suggested Obama was leaving American foreign policy at the mercy of events instead of working to shape global politics in America's interest.",
    " Title: Congress Advances Gun Control Bills as Lawmakers Seek Trump's Support on Firearm Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of mass shootings across the nation, the House Judiciary Committee is set to discuss several gun control bills on Tuesday. The proposed legislation includes measures aimed at limiting access to high-capacity gun magazines, preventing individuals convicted of hate crimes from obtaining firearms, and incentivizing states to adopt extreme risk protection orders, also known as \"red flag\" laws.\n\nHowever, the fate of these bills remains uncertain as the Republican-controlled Senate has yet to indicate whether they will hold votes on the issue. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he will not bring any gun control legislation to the floor until President Trump outlines his preferred policies.\n\nPresident Trump has thus far called for action but has not specified which policies he supports, leading to frustration among some of his Senate allies. Senator Roy Blunt, R-Mo., expressed this sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press, stating, \"The president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do.\"\n\nThe White House has been engaging in discussions with members of Congress and those affected by mass shootings to gather feedback on potential next steps. Tony Montalto, president of Stand with Parkland, which advocates for measures to prevent such tragedies, said, \"This is clearly a time for statesmanship, not partisanship. We need all our congressional leaders to work together for the good of Americans and help make us safer.\"\n\nMontalto's 14-year-old daughter, Gina, was among the victims of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He and other family members affected by the shooting visited the White House at the end of August to discuss potential policy solutions.\n\nAfter the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left 31 people dead, Trump called for strong action on expanding background checks. However, in recent weeks, the president has expressed more concern about addressing mental health issues and the effectiveness of universal background checks.\n\n\"We have to protect our Second Amendment very strongly,\" Trump told reporters on Monday when asked about gun control. The White House has indicated that various measures are being considered, with White House spokesman Hogan Gidley stating, \"It's a deliberative process. We want to do something that will actually help...not just something that will make people feel good.\"\n\nMax Schachter, whose son Alex was killed in the Parkland shooting, attended the August White House meeting. He supports closing loopholes in background checks for gun buyers and expediting the death penalty for mass murderers.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have vowed to continue pushing for gun control measures, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stating, \"We are not taking no for an answer. We are not going away.\" Pelosi highlighted recent public opinion polls indicating widespread support for proposals such as the House-passed bill requiring background checks for almost all gun sales.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has spoken with the president several times over the past month and described him as \"all over the lot\" on the gun issue. Schumer argued that the public support for new gun control measures indicates \"it's a different era\" from previous times when Congress failed to advance any legislation.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Outline Plans to Address Iran Nuclear Deal and U.S.-Cuba Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political statement, two major presidential candidates have outlined their plans to address the ongoing nuclear deal with Iran and the U.S.'s relationship with Cuba. The candidates, who have yet to be named, have criticized the current administration's approach to these two historic events, which they believe have weakened the nation's strategic, moral, and economic standing.\n\nThe candidates' focus is on Iran and Cuba, two countries with complex and contentious histories with the United States. In Iran, the candidates highlight the radical Shia clerics who seek to unite the world under their version of Islam and have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. They also point out Iran's continued financing of terrorists that seek to kill Americans and wipe Israel off the map.\n\nIn Cuba, the candidates call out the anti-American leaders who have been working with nations like Russia and China, spying on the U.S. people and government, harboring fugitives from American justice, and violating human rights. The candidates argue that the current U.S. policy towards Cuba, which they claim has been weak and concessionary, has only served to increase repression of the Cuban people and prevent democratic elections.\n\nThe candidates have proposed a three-part plan to address the Iran nuclear deal. First, they plan to reimpose sanctions on Iran, giving the Iranian regime a choice between an economy or a nuclear program but not both. They also plan to ask Congress to pass new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism. Second, they plan to ensure U.S. forces in the Middle East are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option. Third, they plan to link any talks with Iran to its broader conduct, including human rights abuses, support for terrorism, and threats against Israel.\n\nIn regards to Cuba, the candidates have proposed an equally bold plan. They plan to give the Castro regime a choice between continuing repression of their people and losing the diplomatic relations provided by President Obama, or carrying out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receiving increased U.S. trade, investment, and support. They also plan to restore Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, helping North Korea evade international sanctions, or harboring fugitives from American justice. Finally, they plan to support Cuba's pro-democracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the Cuban people.\n\nThe candidates argue that these are the actions required to restore the safety and security that they believe has been lost under the current administration's diplomacy with dictators. They emphasize the need for strong, principled leadership to address the challenges posed by Iran and Cuba, and pledge to offer such leadership in the years ahead.",
    " Title: Science Education Activist Challenges Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore on Misconceptions about Science Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, science education activist Zack Kopplin confronted The Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore over misconceptions about science funding. The conversation revolved around Moore's criticism of research on \"snail mating habits,\" which he questioned the necessity of.\n\nHowever, as Kopplin pointed out, the reason such research is conducted is due to a serious issue: snails carrying parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis, a disease that is the second most socioeconomically devastating after malaria. In developing countries, where access to clean water and sanitation facilities is limited, people are often exposed to these infected snails. The parasitic worms' infectious larvae emerge from the snails, easily penetrate human skin, and mature in internal organs, leading to schistosomiasis. As of 2009, 74 developing nations had identified significant rates of schistosomiasis in human populations.\n\nMoore, who is not a scientist, is a senior economics writer and an editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal. On a nationally televised show, he called for the termination of a government-funded scientific study while boasting about his lack of understanding of the research behind it.\n\nThis incident echoes similar sentiments expressed by Rush Limbaugh on his radio show the same day, suggesting that science today is an extension of the Democratic Party. For conservative media figures like Moore and Limbaugh, scientific ignorance appears to be a deliberate choice rather than an oversight.\n\nFrom climate science and polar bears to economics to condoms to social sciences to duck penises, conservative media continue to propagate the same anti-science behavior repeatedly. The argument is that scientists are inherently biased because they are passionate about science. This is a third-rate sophism combined with fourth-rate Luddism.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that this is not an assertion that all scientists are correct by default. Instead, media should respect the scientific method, where scientists present arguments with data and rigorously test ideas until a consensus emerges. This is essentially a free market for scientific ideas. Does that sound like something conservatives should be interested in?\n\nFor more information on the scientific method and research projects, check out Zack Kopplin's petition.",
    " Title: Virginia's Off-Year Elections: A Test for the GOP's National Brand\n\nArticle:\n\nThe off-year elections in Virginia are proving to be a significant challenge for the Republican Party as they strive to rebrand themselves on a national level. The state, considered a critical swing state, offers a prime opportunity for the GOP to regain ground lost in the 2012 elections and set a new political narrative.\n\nHowever, the Republican-held state Senate has caused concern among party strategists. The Senate's recent move to redraw the legislative map, and the subsequent flirtation with a proposal to divide Virginia's Electoral College votes by congressional district, has drawn national attention and raised questions about the party's commitment to moderation.\n\nThese actions follow the 2012 uproar over a Virginia measure, championed by conservative state Del. Bob Marshall, mandating ultrasound procedures for women seeking abortions. This issue was used by Democrats as a national cause, driving Virginia women away from the GOP ticket and damaging the campaigns of Mitt Romney and George Allen, who ultimately lost to former governor Tim Kaine.\n\nThe ongoing redistricting controversy and the unresolved legislative map have been a distraction from Governor Bob McDonnell's ambitious proposals to overhaul education and transportation. The Virginia House of Delegates is expected to decide soon whether or not to take up the Senate's provocative new legislative map, with McDonnell's legacy and national profile once again at stake.\n\nMcDonnell's office declined to comment for this story. Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who has criticized the state GOP since withdrawing from the governor's race late last year, lamented the partisan atmosphere in the Virginia capital.\n\n\"I've been very disappointed that this session has taken on such a partisan tone. That's certainly not what we wanted or expected. We have some very big issues on the table this year like transportation funding and education reform, and we don't want to see those issues compromised because of partisan spats over redistricting or anything else,\" Bolling, who has toyed with an independent run for governor, told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"Unfortunately, this is becoming more and more of a way of life in the Virginia General Assembly. Over the past several years, we've seen these types of partisan spats to a degree unlike anything we've historically seen in Virginia.\"\n\nThe stakes are high, as Virginia has become one of the most important swing states in the country, a traditional GOP stronghold that now has two Democratic U.S. senators and voted twice for President Barack Obama. A triumphant last year for McDonnell, capped by a victory for Republicans in the 2013 governor's race, could at least start the process of turning back that tide.\n\nAt the moment, it's an open question whether the GOP will have the discipline to pull that off. While polls show the 2013 governor's race is highly competitive, Republicans have felt distinctly anxious in recent weeks over a series of hard-right comments by state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a hero of national conservatives who has continued to speak out on issues such as contraception and the Affordable Care Act despite outside pressure to pivot toward the middle.",
    " Title: Investigation Launched as Gateway Pundit and Associates Allegedly Promote Fake Sexual Assault Allegations Against Robert Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Gateway Pundit writer Jacob Wohl and Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman have found themselves at the center of an investigation after allegations surfaced that they were attempting to promote false sexual assault allegations against FBI special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAccording to NBC News, two weeks ago, prominent reporters received an email from a woman claiming that someone associated with Burkman was offering money to make false sexual assault allegations. After reporters contacted Mueller's office to inquire about the claims, Mueller requested that the FBI look into the apparent hoax.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, told NBC News, \"When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the special counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation.\"\n\nReporters began investigating the source of the claims, which were being promoted by Wohl and Burkman online. Wohl tweeted on Oct. 19 that a \"prominent DC insider\" told him that women were \"prepared to make credible allegations\" against Mueller.\n\nTuesday, Burkman announced that he would reveal the first of Mueller's accusers at a Nov. 1 press conference. One of the women was supposed to say she worked at the law firm Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro in 1974 along with Mueller, and that was when the assault would have taken place. The law firm told NBC News that there was no record of that woman ever having worked there.\n\nBurkman claimed he was investigating sexual misconduct and alcohol allegations. However, when media inquiries were made, Burkman responded by telling The Hill Reporter that Jacob Wohl ran Surefire Intelligence, a firm that was supposedly involved in the investigation. Wohl denied any connection to the sexual assault investigation, and to Surefire Intelligence, but the evidence suggested otherwise.\n\nWohl's email was listed in the domain records for Surefire Intelligence's website, the phone number for the company redirected to Wohl's mother's voicemail, and alleged Surefire employees had fake LinkedIn profiles using headshots of random people pulled from the internet. One alleged employee even looked suspiciously like Wohl himself, under the name \"Matthew Cohen.\"\n\nThere were some other tells that Surefire was a fraud company: the company's LLC was just incorporated a few weeks ago, and the address Surefire listed is occupied by a law firm that said it had no connection to Surefire. Wohl stopped responding to NBC News when they called him out about the phone numbers.\n\nGateway Pundit published alleged \"exclusive documents\" about the fake sexual assault allegation -- documents which, although partially redacted, contained a slogan tied to Surefire Intelligence. The documents posted on Gateway Pundit indicate that one woman would accuse Mueller of sexual misconduct at a New York City hotel on Aug. 2, 2010. However, Mueller was serving jury duty in Washington, D.C. on that day.\n\nUPDATE: Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft tweeted that the site has taken down documents it posted related to the fabricated allegations against Mueller, and that it is also looking into the allegations that Pundit writer Jacob Wohl was involved in the scheme.",
    " Title: Amtrak Train Collides with Freight Train in South Carolina, Killing Two and Injuring 116\n\nAn Amtrak passenger train collided with a parked freight train in Cayce, South Carolina, on Sunday, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and the injury of at least 116 others. This is the fourth fatal Amtrak crash since December.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 2:35 a.m. local time (0735 GMT) when Amtrak Train 91, traveling from New York to Miami, hit a CSX Corp freight train that was stopped on a side track. The collision took place at a switch where a padlock had been attached to steer train traffic that way, according to Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Board (NTSB).\n\nThe NTSB is investigating the incident, with a focus on understanding why the switch was lined in that manner. The damage to the locomotives was described as \"catastrophic.\" Two crew members, Michael Kempf, 54, of Savannah, Georgia, and Michael Cella, 36, of Orange Park, Florida, were killed in the crash. Autopsies are currently being conducted.\n\nA total of 116 people were injured in the crash, with two in critical condition. The collision occurred about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the state capital, Columbia. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster described the scene as \"horrible\" and noted the extensive damage to the trains.\n\nAmtrak President and CEO Richard Anderson expressed the company's condolences and stated that CSX owns and controls the dispatching of all trains, including the signal systems that control access to sidings and yards. The passenger train hit the tail end of the freight train, which had two locomotives and 34 empty auto racks.\n\nThe passenger train's locomotive was left lying on its side, and the first car was bent and also derailed, although it remained upright. At least four of the freight train's cars were crumpled but remained on the tracks. Approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel leaked as a result of the collision, but there was no threat to public safety.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump received regular updates on the crash while at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed his condolences via Twitter, praising the work of first responders. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster stated that the Amtrak train was traveling at about 59 miles (95 km) per hour upon impact.\n\nThe NTSB did not release details on the speed at which the Amtrak train was traveling. In December, three people were killed when an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Washington state. In late January, an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of the U.S. Congress killed one person in a garbage truck with which it collided in Virginia. A Federal Railroad Administration Investigative team is also on the scene in South Carolina to help establish what happened.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation stated, \"It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Decision to Remove Protest Information Sparks Free Speech Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked a heated debate on free speech, Facebook has removed information about protests against state stay-at-home orders, citing potential violations of public health guidelines. The decision has been met with criticism from Republican senators, who accuse the social media giant of colluding with state governments to suppress free speech.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned Facebook's decision, asking, \"Because free speech is now illegal America?\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also expressed concern, stating, \"Given Big Tech\u2019s history of bias and censorship, I\u2019m deeply concerned that they and government officials are partnering not to protect public health, but to shut down views with which they disagree.\"\n\nHowever, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal praised the company's move, tweeting, \"Powerful special interests are using astroturfing & dangerous tactics to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Facebook is right to take a stand against harmful misinformation.\"\n\nThe initial reports suggested that Facebook removed the protest information at the request of state authorities. However, a spokesperson later clarified that the company sought guidance from states but ultimately made its own decision to take the posts down.\n\n\"We reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their orders, not about removing specific protests on Facebook,\" the spokesperson said. \"We remove the posts when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful.\"\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered a slightly different explanation in an interview with ABC News, suggesting that the company removes content that disputes social distancing practices and therefore poses a \"risk of imminent physical harm.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Facebook has faced criticism for its policies on removing content. The company has faced blowback for its handling of misleading political ads and vaccine misinformation.\n\nVera Eidelman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, expressed concern about Facebook's decision, stating, \"Facebook, which controls a platform for the speech of billions, should not be censoring political speech online.\"\n\nDavid Greene, civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argued that Facebook seemingly deciding to remove protests based on whether they violate state law provides an objective yardstick. However, he noted that without further clarity, it can be difficult to judge the fairness of the company's decisions.\n\nMatthew Feeney, the director of the libertarian Cato Institute's project on emerging technologies, contends that Facebook's decision to remove potentially harmful content offers a defensible rationale during a pandemic.\n\nFacebook, Google, Twitter, and other social media companies have long denied that politics is a factor in their decisions about what content they will and will not allow. However, the companies have faced criticism for their lack of transparency in these decisions.\n\nIn the past, Facebook has taken an aggressive approach to \"freedom of expression,\" as outlined by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a speech at Georgetown University last fall. Zuckerberg acknowledged that free expression is not absolute and cited social and civil rights activists as examples that inspired his stance. However, he also noted that the company would make exceptions when speech can cause adverse effects such as discrimination, harassment, and physical harm.",

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to bypass Mr. Reid and speak directly with Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nThe impasse seemed to ease when Republicans dropped their demand to change Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment formula, and both sides began discussing the income level at which taxpayers will see an income-tax rate increase and debating what other incentives would be included.\n\n\"You can't win an argument that has Social Security for seniors versus taxes for the rich. So we need to take it off the table,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, explained why the party decided to forgo demands for entitlement reform.\n\nA deal would need to pass not only the Senate, but also the House, where conservative Republicans hold sway. In the absence of an agreement, Senate Democrats were preparing to force a vote on Monday on their own fallback solution, which would raise taxes on families making more than $250,000, extend unemployment benefits, and could include other party priorities.\n\nHowever, this legislation is unlikely to reach President Obama's desk, leaving a narrow window for a deal that could save millions of taxpayers from rate increases.\n\nThe fiscal cliff refers to the combination of across-the-board tax increases due on Tuesday, followed by $110 billion in automatic spending cuts imposed as a result of last year's deal to raise the debt ceiling. Analysts predict that the combination will plunge the economy into a short, sharp recession, though in the long run, the deficit will drop, government debt will return to manageable levels, and the economy will be stronger over the next decade.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner traded blame for the situation.\n\n\"They say that their biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way, but the way they're behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans are protected,\" Mr. Obama said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program.\n\nMr. Boehner countered that the House has passed bills to cancel the tax cuts and the automatic spending \"sequesters,\" and that Mr. Obama could have prevented the situation if he had pressured Senate Democrats to send the House a bill.\n\nBoth sides have made significant concessions. The Republicans have conceded one of their major principles in agreeing to higher tax rates, while Mr. Obama has said he could accept tax increases beginning at income levels higher than the ones on which he campaigned: $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families.\n\nThe latest offer from Republicans is to let rates rise on individuals making more than $450,000 and families making more than $550,000, according to Democrats, who countered with rates above the $360,000 and $450,000 levels.\n\nRegardless of what happens with marginal rates, all taxpayers are likely to see at least some tax increases with the expiration of the 2 percentage-point payroll-tax holiday, which was worth about $1,000 to the average taxpayer last year.\n\nIt remains unclear whether any final deal will cancel the other part of the cliff: the $110 billion in automatic spending cuts due on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans argue that Democrats want to use the money from higher tax rates to cancel the cuts and to cover new unemployment-benefit spending, which would mean the deficit wouldn't go down at all and defeat the purpose of a deal on taxes.\n\nHowever, Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, defended the new unemployment-benefit spending, arguing that it was needed stimulus at a time when the economy is still struggling.\n\nEven as leaders butted heads, some senators said they were preparing their own workarounds.\n\n\"I will tell you that I've talked with numerous Democrats and Republicans on the floor, and there are a lot of subgroups who are eager to tackle this issue and try to come up with a solution if the negotiations break down at the leaders' level,\" said Sen. Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican.",
    " Title: Federal Investigation Clears NASCAR of Hate Crime Allegations in Noose Incident Involving Bubba Wallace\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the discovery of a noose-like object in Bubba Wallace's garage stall at Talladega Superspeedway, federal authorities have announced that no charges will be filed in the incident that had rocked NASCAR and its only full-time Black driver.\n\nThe noose, which was found on June 21, was determined to have been hanging since at least last October, according to U.S. Attorney Jay Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. The investigation revealed that the noose was not a hate crime, as it was not a targeted act against Wallace.\n\nNASCAR, the sanctioning body of the stock car racing series, had called in federal authorities after one of Wallace's crew members discovered the rope-like object in their garage stall. The series had been on heightened alert due to Wallace's active role in advocating for racial equality and the recent threats he had received.\n\nThe noose was the only garage stall with a pull-down rope that resembled a noose, according to NASCAR. The authorities' investigation found that nobody could have known Wallace would be assigned to that specific stall.\n\nBubba Wallace, who never saw the rope, expressed his anger and fear for his family's safety after the incident. He was initially convinced that a hate crime had been committed. However, even after the FBI's conclusion, Wallace remains adamant that the rope was fashioned into a noose.\n\nNASCAR has defended its reaction and insisted it would call the FBI again if a similar situation arises. The series opened the Talladega gates to 5,000 fans, its highest number since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince finding his voice over the last month, Wallace has become a prominent figure in NASCAR's attempt to move past its rocky racial history. He has worn an \"I Can't Breathe\" shirt, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme, and successfully lobbied for the Confederate flag ban.\n\nNASCAR assigned security to Wallace at the track, and the first word of the incident came in a sharply-worded statement in which NASCAR said it was \"angry and outraged\" over the \"heinous act\" that the series directly linked to racism. The series rallied around Wallace, with every team member on pit road lining up behind him during the national anthem.\n\nThe FBI sent 15 agents to Talladega for Monday's rescheduled race. The investigation confirmed that the rope \"was in that garage as early as October 2019\" hanging from a garage door. The rope was referred to as a noose, but can be used as a handle when closing the door.\n\nNASCAR is still investigating why the rope was tied that way, and NASCAR President Steve Phelps has continued to call it a noose after authorities said no charges would be filed. The series has yet to detail how it will address Wallace's call to stop the display of the Confederate flag.",
    " Title: Yazidi Volunteers Receive Training from Kurdish Forces in Syria to Combat Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe exact number of Yazidi men, women, and children who have been massacred by the Islamic State remains uncertain, but reports detailing the atrocities committed against this peaceful religious minority have been alarming. The Yazidis, who have been subjected to kidnappings, forced slavery, and unwanted marriages, are now fighting back.\n\nKurdish forces in Syria have reportedly trained hundreds of Yazidi volunteers, who are now returning to the battlefield in Iraq. According to Reuters, these civilians undergo only a few days of training before risking their lives fighting ISIS.\n\nA Reuters photographer visited a training camp at the Serimli military base in Qamishli, northeastern Syria, on the border with Iraqi Kurdistan, where he saw 55 Yazidis being trained to fight ISIS. The trainees, both young and old men, were taught how to use assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades by the Syrian Kurds, sweating in the 40-degree Celsius heat.\n\n\"The Yazidi civilians want to stay in Syria because it is safer, but the volunteers really want to go back to Iraq to fight,\" the photographer said by phone.\n\nIn Syria, the Yazidi volunteers train in weapon use and fighting tactics for several days before being sent back to Mount Sinjar to fight, a member from the media office of the Kurdish YPG told Reuters. \"There are several training camps for Yazidi men who have volunteered,\" Anas Hani said from eastern Syria. \"In the past ten days, hundreds have graduated. And we are training more.\"\n\nISIS is a highly sophisticated fighting force. However, the brave, all-women battalion already fighting these murderous jihadists in Iraq may soon find reinforcements in the form of these Yazidi volunteers. It is hoped that these newly armed civilians will soon start making a difference in the ongoing battle against ISIS.",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Actions and New Initiatives Amidst Ongoing Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to regain momentum following the failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump has taken swift action, signing an executive order to roll back some of President Obama's key policies on climate change and carbon emissions. On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions made a surprise appearance at the White House daily media briefing to discuss the administration's opposition to so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nMeanwhile, the president announced the new White House Office of American Innovation, led by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The group aims to develop fresh solutions to persistent problems afflicting American society.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether this burst of activity can help Trump find his footing or settle jangled nerves on the right. The failed healthcare push, which reached its denouement last Friday, was a debacle even in the eyes of the president's natural allies. While some Republicans, such as Speaker Paul Ryan, are vowing to revisit healthcare, there is no clear path forward.\n\nInvestigations into alleged connections between Russia and people in Trump's orbit, as well as the related controversy over the conduct of Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, are pestering the administration. The next big-ticket item on Trump's agenda is tax reform, but any push toward that goal will be subject to the same treacherous cross-currents on Capitol Hill that sank the healthcare push.\n\nExecutive orders repealing Obama-era regulations and hard-edged rhetoric on illegal immigration at least give supporters heart. \"I don't think his agenda has changed,\" said Barry Bennett, who served as a senior adviser for Trump's presidential bid. \"But, Bennett added, items that did not require congressional approval 'are going to happen, so [the White House] can shift the narrative when they desire, which is what they are doing.\"\n\nTrump's capacity to drive media coverage and change the subject when required can be vital, according to Bennett. \"It's really valuable because it's only Tuesday and we are not talking about defeat on Friday,\" Bennett said yesterday. \"We are talking about coal and sanctuary cities and reforming government.\"\n\nTrump has not focused only on policy since the healthcare push went awry. He has taken to Twitter to blame the conservative House Freedom Caucus for his defeat and has insisted that Obamacare will \"explode.\" Fueling the kind of palace intrigue that has surrounded his White House, Trump tweeted a recommendation that his followers should watch Jeanine Pirro's Fox News show over the weekend. Pirro used that platform to call for the resignation of Speaker Paul Ryan. The White House pushed back at suggestions that Trump knew what Pirro was going to say.\n\nTo some critics, Trump's feverish level of activity has a negative flip side: an unwillingness to do the honest self-reflection that might help him avoid repeating mistakes. \"He lives in a sort of reality-distortion field where he doesn't want to acknowledge that he makes any mistakes,\" said Timothy O'Brien, the author of a biography of Trump. \"He very rarely acknowledges making mistakes, and I think that is largely because he has been insulated from the consequences of his mistakes his whole life.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump often displayed a propensity to create the kind of big news that drowned out his rivals. His initial announcement that he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the United States came with the Iowa caucuses looming. It was made within hours of a poll showing his then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz leading Trump in the state.\n\nTwo months later, Trump again threw out the political rulebook and hit back at criticism from Pope Francis. Another Trump biographer, Michael D'Antonio, noted at the time on CNN's website that \"even those of us who know him and his fighting mentality have to marvel at his ability to find new battles.\"\n\n\"If he did not bounce back from adversity, he would be hosting 'The Apprentice' at the current time,\" said Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor who specializes in political communication. \"He's the maestro of agenda-setting, both for good and bad. All it takes is 140 characters [on Twitter] and at least one or two news cycles get converted to focusing on a new aspect of Trump and his presidency.\"\n\nCritical voices like O'Brien's believe Trump is in a different world now, however\u2014subject to the intense scrutiny that faces any president and with the Russian controversy lapping at his feet. \"The most dangerous thing, staring him right in the face, is the Russia investigation,\" O'Brien said. \"And all of his diversionary tactics haven't actually taken that away as the central thing that the media and Capitol Hill are looking at. He hasn't changed the narrative on that and, in fact, the response has been very ham-handed. Exhibit A on that is Devin Nunes.\"\n\nBut Trump loyalists remain convinced that he can bounce back once again, even when the stakes are at their highest. \"I am still very optimistic,\" said Bennett. \"We had bad days in the campaign. Next day, we're on to the next fight.\"",
    " Title: Rove Slams Defund-Obamacare Caucus: Unrealistic and Lacking Tactical Sense\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, political strategist Karl Rove, known for his role in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, has criticized the Defund-Obamacare Caucus for their efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Rove, who was a key advisor to former President George W. Bush, expressed doubt in the caucus's ability to succeed in their quest, citing the lack of support from Senate Democrats and the potential for a government shutdown.\n\nRove argued that the caucus's plan would require convincing some Democrat or Democrats in the Senate majority to join their cause, a highly unlikely scenario. He also pointed out that even if such a scenario were to occur, the president would simply veto the measure, requiring a supermajority in both houses of Congress to override the veto. Rove stated, \"No sentient being believes that will happen.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, the Defund-Obamacare Caucus has persisted in their efforts, even after Senator Ted Cruz admitted the votes were not there and after the caucus's principal cheerleader, Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint, acknowledged that the defunding effort is primarily a public relations stunt. Last week, the caucus staged a coup of sorts against House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, who had been trying to negotiate a more tactical approach.\n\nThe standoff between the caucus and the Democratic party could lead to a government shutdown, potentially bringing nearly all federal activity to a halt. In such a scenario, public outrage would likely fall upon the Republican party, as it did during the 1995 shutdown.\n\nWhile the Democrats are not without fault in this standoff, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's complaint that \"bipartisanship is a thing of the past\" is met with skepticism. Reid's history of partisan behavior is well-documented, and his call for bipartisanship rings hollow.\n\nPresident Obama has also drawn criticism for his refusal to negotiate on raising the debt ceiling, another fiscal debate that will follow the appropriations fight in short order. Some argue that Republicans are holding the debt ceiling hostage, endangering the country's credit rating and economic recovery. However, the analogy of the debt ceiling as a hostage situation is problematic, as the president is not backing down, but rather is willing to let the economic consequences of a default occur.\n\nThe long-term fiscal trajectory of the United States is unsustainable, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Without real and deep cuts to entitlements, the national debt will ruin the country. While the Defund-Obamacare Caucus is focused on denying the reality of the Affordable Care Act, the whole country is denying the reality of the national debt. The caucus's efforts to defund Obamacare may be misguided, but the more pressing issue is the unsustainable growth of entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.",
    " Title: Kushner's \"Shadow Task Force\" and the Ethical Implications of Oscar's Involvement in the Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nFor several weeks, Jared Kushner has been leading a \"shadow task force\" on the coronavirus, separate from Vice President Mike Pence's official committee, according to The Washington Post. This unofficial group, comprised of federal officials allied with Kushner and outside corporate executives, has been meeting at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nOn March 13, a senior official at HHS reached out to health insurance company Oscar for assistance, the Oscar spokesperson said, on the same day of Trump's press conference. The task force, led by Kushner, focused on expanding and publicizing coronavirus testing, particularly at drive-through locations. Oscar's website, designed to resemble a government-developed product, would have asked users about their symptoms, risk factors, and listed limited testing locations nationwide.\n\nOscar's website, which resembled a tool the company had already built for its customers in response to the crisis, was adjusted to meet the specifications and requirements set by the federal government. Jackie Kahn, the Oscar spokesperson, stated that Oscar had already been working on a coronavirus-testing website when HHS called for help, a coincidence that had nothing to do with Kushner. She declined to discuss whether Oscar had discussed the site with Joshua Kushner or any board members or investors before Trump's March 13 press conference.\n\nOscar donated its work freely and never expected to be paid for the project, Kahn said. The company is \"not, nor has ever been,\" a contractor or subcontractor for the government, she said, which would make it harder for the government to pay Oscar for its work. The work was \"all at the direction of HHS,\" she said. \"The website never saw the light of day,\" she added in an interview today.\n\nThe ad hoc nature of Kushner's task force has already collided with federal laws. Oscar's involvement deepens Kushner's ethics and conflict-of-interest problems.\n\n\"It's not typical. It's usually not allowed,\" Jessica Tillipman, an assistant dean at the George Washington University School of Law and an expert on anti-corruption law, told me. Oscar's relationship with the Trump administration could breach federal law in two ways, Tillipman and other experts told me. First, companies are generally not supposed to work for the federal government for free, though some exceptions can be made in a national emergency. \"The concern, when you have some free services, is that it makes the government beholden to the company,\" Tillipman said.",
    " Title: Intra-Party Tensions Mount as Gillibrand and Pelosi Criticize Obama on Military Sexual Assault and Trade Agreements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama is facing criticism from within his own party, with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi voicing their disapproval on two significant issues: military sexual assault and trade agreements.\n\nGillibrand, a vocal advocate for military sexual assault reform, criticized Obama for not fulfilling his promise from December 2013 to overhaul the Defense Department's judicial system if progress wasn't made within a year. \"A year has long passed, and we haven't seen the kind of changes that we need,\" Gillibrand said. \"I do not believe they are taking the issue as seriously as they should, and they should not be resisting the professionalization of the military justice system.\"\n\nThis public rebuke came after the Senate voted down an amendment sponsored by Gillibrand, which aimed to remove the prosecution of sexual assault from the military justice chain of command.\n\nPelosi's criticism followed closely, as she delivered a stinging blow to the administration by voting against two related trade bills. Pelosi, who had been seen as a silent ally to Obama and the Republican-led House in promoting Obama's trade agenda, kept her position secret until the end of Friday's debate. When she announced her opposition, she stated, \"Our people would rather have a job than trade assistance.\"\n\nPelosi's opposition was to prevent the fast-track legislation, which would allow the president to negotiate trade deals with limited Congressional interference, from moving forward. This stance prevented her from supporting the trade bills in the House.\n\nIn a move that could be seen as a blow to President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential election, appeared to back Pelosi. Clinton made no specific statement on her position but did mention Pelosi's efforts to challenge Obama's free trade deal negotiations twice.\n\n\"The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,\" Clinton said. \"And if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\n\nWith Gillibrand's amendment failing in the Senate and Pelosi's opposition to Obama's trade efforts continuing, intra-party resistance to Obama's initiatives on trade, military sexual assault, and other issues is likely to persist.",

The boy's fate remains unknown.\n\nThe boy dialed South Korea's emergency number, telling dispatchers for a local fire service, \"Help us. The boat is sinking.\" This revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew, nine of whom are facing charges in last week's sinking.\n\nThe coast guard stated that the ship's crew made a distress call to maritime officials only three minutes later. The initial distress call from a passenger aboard the sinking ship is likely to raise questions about the crew's response time and their actions during the crisis.\n\nAt least 146 people are confirmed dead, according to the joint task force leading the search. The death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship's cafeteria, where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week. However, early Wednesday, the coast guard said no bodies had been found in the cafeteria.\n\nRescuers will continue to focus on the third and fourth decks of the five-level ship, said Koh Myung-seok, a spokesman for the joint task force. The search and rescue operation is still ongoing, but no survivors have been found since 174 people were rescued soon after the ferry went down.\n\nAs the search continues, investigators are trying to figure out what happened to make the ship list before finally capsizing and sinking into the ocean. Initial criticism has focused on the captain and some crew members. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday that their actions were \"akin to murder.\"\n\nThe captain, Lee Joon-seok, has defended his decision to tell passengers to stay put as the ferry began sinking, saying he was concerned about the sea's strong currents and cold water as well as the lack of rescue ships. Questions have been raised about why the third mate was steering the ship when it ran into trouble on its way to a popular vacation island. The captain was in his cabin at the time.\n\nChonghaejin Marine, which operated the ferry, has posted an apology on its website. \"We pray for the Sewol victims who lost their precious lives due to the accident,\" it said. \"We prostrate ourselves before the victims' families and beg for forgiveness.\"\n\nAs the search for survivors and the investigation into the cause of the disaster continue, the nation mourns the loss of 146 lives and waits for answers.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Agencies Conclude COVID-19 Not Manmade, Investigating Possible Lab Leak in Wuhan\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the novel coronavirus was not manmade or genetically modified but are still examining whether the origins of the pandemic may be traced to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab in Wuhan. The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of U.S. spy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have touted the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic that has killed over 220,000 worldwide.\n\nThe statement reads, \"The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified. The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\"\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, with Pompeo urging China to allow outside experts into the lab \"so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.\" However, a U.S. intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory.\n\nScientists believe the virus arose naturally in bats. However, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is located 8 miles from the market that is considered a possible source. U.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in 2018, but they have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.\n\nChina has denied any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang citing the institute's director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen. Geng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should focus on \"better controlling the epidemic situation at home.\"\n\nHowever, Chinese government spokesman Zhao Lijian demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic, tweeting in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army. The U.S. intelligence agencies continue to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the possibility of a lab accident in Wuhan still under examination.",

I have faith that we will survive this as a nation and build together.\"\n\nOmar further expressed her support for Trump's efforts, stating, \"We should never let politics get in the way of good policy. This is a great start, and I hope others will be part of a united front to push for good policies.\"\n\nThis rare praise for the president comes as other strict opponents of Trump have voiced favorable opinions of how the president is reacting to the coronavirus outbreak. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, a known Trump critic, told his viewers on Tuesday that it was time to rally around the president and his efforts. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also praised Trump's reaction to the coronavirus crisis, stating that the president was \"100% sincere in saying he wanted to work together in partnership, in a spirit of cooperation.\"\n\nEven CNN's Dana Bash had kind words for the president on Tuesday, stating that Trump is \"being the kind of leader that people need, at least in tone, today and yesterday, in a tone that people need, and want, and yearn for in times of crisis and uncertainty.\"\n\nTrump has taken several significant steps in response to the coronavirus outbreak, including declaring a national emergency, promoting a $1 trillion stimulus bill, and ordering military hospital ships to the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the U.S. to treat coronavirus victims.",

When asked if he felt he owed anyone an apology, Sandmann replied, \"As far as standing there, I had every right to do so. My position is that I was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips. I respect him. I'd like to talk to him.\"\n\nSandmann added, \"In hindsight, I wish we could have walked away and avoided the whole thing.\"\n\nThe encounter, which was captured on video, showed Sandmann, wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, appearing to smile and stand close to Phillips as the activist sang and played a drum during the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\nIn a statement released over the weekend, Sandmann's family stated that the encounter occurred after another incident, not shown in the initial video clip, in which four African-American protestors allegedly directed \"derogatory insults\" at his school group. Sandmann, with permission from a chaperone, led students in school spirit chants to counter the alleged hateful remarks.\n\nIn the statement, Sandmann said he \"never interacted\" with Phillips and was \"startled and confused as to why he had approached me.\"\n\nPhillips, who initiated the encounter, has previously stated that he approached the students in an attempt to defuse tension from a heated exchange he claimed to have witnessed between the students and the Black Hebrew Israelites. Phillips has criticized the school chaperones, questioning their actions during the incident.\n\nPhillips has suggested sensitivity training and cultural education for the students, stating, \"Instead of being expelled, the students should go through some kind of sensitivity training.

    " Title: Trump's Tax Reform Plan and the Unaddressed Issue of Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has become all too familiar, Congress has passed yet another stop-gap spending bill, with the focus now shifting to President Trump's long-awaited tax reform plan. The plan, as outlined, appears to cater to conservative ideals, with corporate tax rates slashed, the top income tax bracket lowered, and the repeal of the Obamacare tax on investments. The plan also doubles the standard income tax deduction, benefiting a majority of Trump's working-class base.\n\nHowever, the plan faces a significant challenge that has long bedeviled reformers in the two controlling parties: the failure to curb spending that necessitates higher taxes. After years of broken promises and annual warnings of a fiscal crisis, the impending crisis seems to no longer alarm the public.\n\nWith a Republican in the White House, the deficit is once again a topic of concern, and most mainstream discussions revolve around the potential increase in the deficit due to Trump's tax plan. Vice President Pence, in a recent interview with MSNBC's Chuck Todd, asserted that while the plan might increase the deficit in the short term, economic growth would offset this gap. However, Democrats and nonpartisan watchdogs express skepticism about Pence's forecast.\n\nThe exact \"pay-fors\" included in the final package remain unclear, but it is good news that President Trump has abandoned the Border Adjustment Tax, a move welcomed by those who value affordable consumer goods and free markets.\n\nThe deficit implications could potentially jeopardize the political chances of passing any major reform. Republicans, who have long criticized debt and spending under Obama, find themselves in an unenviable position, especially if they continue to ignore spending.\n\nTrump's tax reform plan is estimated to add around $6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. When the Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's campaign tax plan last year, they found that about a third of this deficit impact would be offset by economic growth.\n\nTo address the remaining deficit, it would be nearly impossible, politically and procedurally, to seek spending cuts to match every dollar in tax changes. However, to abandon the idea outright would be unacceptable. Obvious cuts abound.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office's 2017 study of duplication and fragmentation identifies at least $20 billion in potential savings per year. Past estimates by former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn have been as high as $95 billion per year. For our purposes, let's assume a conservative total of $25 billion year or $250 billion over a decade in savings.\n\nIn January, news broke that the Pentagon buried an internal report that found administrative waste alone could be reduced by $125 billion over a 5-year period, without requiring layoffs or personnel reductions. There's another $25 billion per year from the country's biggest discretionary department.\n\nNo politically dicey changes would be required just yet on the infamous mandatory side. There are the well-documented improper government payments, estimated at $144 billion for fiscal year 2016. Most of this is overpayments by Medicare and Medicaid, along with other programs like federal education grants and the EITC.\n\nThis brings the total identified savings to just under $200 billion, assuming no increases since 2016.\n\nTo be clear, no spending cut is easy \u2013 every dollar in waste has its own interest group loudly insisting no other dollar could be more important to the wellbeing of the country.\n\nHowever, these suggestions involve neither sequestering workers nor meaningfully changing the size or role of government and its departments. When just a few items can make up as much as half of the shortfall from a massive tax cut, it should be a sign to policymakers that focusing on spending cuts is possible.\n\nAnd if Republicans believe cutting duplicative programs, self-identified waste, and improper payments is just not politically possible and not worth fighting for, perhaps they should ask themselves just what they're doing in Washington in the first place.",

The Republican losses have grown to at least 35 House seats, with the possibility of reaching 40 as the remaining close races are settled. The Democratic Party also flipped a second Senate seat from red to blue with Kyrsten Sinema's victory in the Arizona race.\n\nThese results solidify the Democratic Party's takeover of the House and maintain the Republican Senate majority in a thin margin. The Democrats also gained at least seven governors' mansions, won back majorities in eight state legislative chambers, and flipped at least 329 state legislative seats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, expressed optimism about his party's performance, particularly the \"Women of the West\" \u2013 Sens.-elect Sinema and Jacky Rosen, who won Republican seats in Arizona and Nevada, respectively.\n\nIn Florida, the results of the Senate and Governor's races are still uncertain due to ongoing recounts. As of Tuesday, Republican Governor Rick Scott led Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or 0.15 percent of the approximately 8.2 million votes cast. Republican Ron DeSantis had a 33,000-vote advantage over Democrat Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the recount of the Florida governor's race.\n\nPresident Trump, who initially declared the midterms a Republican success, now faces a more challenging picture, with the possibility of gaining only one or two additional Senate seats. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon commented, \"If the GOP has many more'victories' like this, it will go the way of the Whigs.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the growing Democratic wins. This marks the first time a president's party gained Senate seats in the midterms since 2002 under President George W. Bush and the fourth time since 1914.\n\nThe Republican Party's losses in 2018 are less severe than President Obama's loss of 63 Democratic House seats and seven Democratic Senate seats in his first midterm, which he called a \"shellacking.\" However, the setbacks this year still represent a significant challenge for the president and the Republican Party.\n\nChris Grant, founder of the Republican consulting firm Big Dog Strategies in Buffalo, described the election as \"a tough night all around\" for the Republican Party. He attributed the Democratic Party's success partly to candidates raising more money through ActBlue, a fundraising platform that allowed small-dollar donors to give to a variety of Democratic candidates across the nation. Grant suggested that the Trump presidential campaign's focus on small-dollar donors in 2016 could benefit the Republicans in 2020 during President Trump's re-election campaign. Grant concluded, \"The one good thing about 2018 is that there's a lot of lessons to be learned that can fix things in time for the presidential.\"",
    " Title: Senate Stalls Chuck Hagel's Confirmation as Defense Secretary, First Time in U.S. History\n\nArticle:\n\nThursday saw a significant development in the ongoing saga of Chuck Hagel's nomination as President Obama's second-term defense secretary. The nomination fell two votes short of the required 60 in the Senate, which would have allowed it to proceed to a final vote. The vote, largely along party lines, was 58 to 40 with one senator voting present.\n\nFour Republicans joined Democrats in voting to end debate and proceed to a final vote. They were Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressed his disappointment, stating, \"Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse.\" Reid plans to schedule another procedural vote for the week after next to try to advance Hagel's nomination to a final vote.\n\nThe Democrats and Republicans have differing perspectives on the nature of the Senate's actions. Democrats insist that the Republicans have filibustered the Hagel nomination, marking the first time a defense secretary has had his nomination stalled in such a way. Republicans, however, maintain they have not filibustered the nomination, with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) stating, \"This is not an attempt to kill this nomination, it's not a filibuster.\"\n\nInitially, Hagel faced immediate opposition, but it seemed for many weeks that while many Republicans would vote against Hagel's confirmation, no one would actively try to block it. However, some Republican senators, such as Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are reportedly open to allowing Hagel's nomination to receive an up-or-down final vote, so long as it comes after the recess. In a final post-filibuster floor vote, Hagel would need only 51 votes to be confirmed.\n\nSenate Republicans have argued that before a floor vote on his nomination happens, Hagel needs to answer more questions about speeches he has given since leaving the Senate in 2009, including to an Arab-American group. They've also raised questions about his financial dealings, queries which Senate Democrats say are unjustified.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans have expanded the questions they want answered before they allow a vote on Hagel. Some questions for the administration center on the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi attack on the U.S. Consulate and its aftermath, an issue unrelated to Hagel but leading to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe confirmation process for Hagel, a former Senate Republican, has been marked by intense scrutiny and debate, with some senators displeased with Hagel for various reasons, including his shift in stance on the Iraq War and surge, perceived softness on Iran, and hardness on Israel, as well as his performance during the confirmation hearing.\n\nIf the Hagel nomination fails, President Obama will be left with two options: finding a more acceptable nominee for Senate Republicans or following the John Paul Jones route, telling Senate Republicans he has not yet begun to fight and sending them another nominee who would likely provoke further opposition.",
    " Title: Senate Hearings on Russian Hacking: A Matter of National Security and Political Maneuvering\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee's Russian hacking hearings on Thursday have been a subject of debate, with some suggesting the hearings may have been used to undermine the U.S. presidential election. However, the consensus among top U.S. intelligence officials is that Russia indeed hacked into the Democratic National Committee emails, with the intention of interfering in the election.\n\nThe hearings have sparked controversy, with allegations of political maneuvering and finger-pointing. The hacking, if confirmed, is a serious matter that should enrage every American, as it represents a cyber-attack on the United States. The perpetrators should be met with significant retaliatory action.\n\nThe hacking has exposed numerous issues within the Democratic Party, but the responsibility for these lies, corruption, and political rigging lies with Hillary Clinton and her associates, not the hackers. The United States has been under cyber-attack from various adversaries, including Russia, China, and Iran, for years. The efforts by President Obama and his national security team to thwart these attacks have evidently been insufficient.\n\nSome blame for the hack must be attributed to the Democratic National Committee and its officials, including John Podesta, for their lack of email system security. The use of a password like \"[email protected]\" for security purposes is not secure.\n\nDuring the hearings, President-elect Donald Trump seemed to be on trial, with Senator Tim Kaine, the failed vice-presidential candidate, attempting to make light of the situation. His jokes fell flat, and he later criticized \"fake news\" and Trump's security team.\n\nThe hearings also brought to light the failures of the Obama administration's security officials, who have been responsible for protecting America's cyber interests for the past eight years. Their handling of the Islamic State and their response to the Russian hacking have been criticized.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper, a key figure in the hearings, has been accused of lying in the past. During the hearing, he struggled to differentiate between hacking and the use of hacked information to influence the election, a political question outside his area of expertise. Clapper defended the Obama administration's failure to punish cyber-espionage aggressors.\n\nThe hearings have provided a glimpse into the Obama Doctrine, often referred to as the \"Glass House Doctrine.\" This doctrine suggests that the United States is just another country in a world of struggling nations, with nothing unique or exceptional to offer. The United States, according to President Obama, is exceptional, but only in the same sense that every other country is exceptional. This perspective has been met with criticism and debate.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Aims to Bolster Oil Industry Amidst Coronavirus-Induced Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to support the struggling oil industry, President Trump announced on Friday that the Department of Energy would purchase crude oil for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. The move, Trump said, would help the industry reeling from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and save taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\nThe announcement led to a slight increase in oil prices, with prices rising nearly 5% after Friday's announcement. However, this was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week.\n\nThe impact of the recent decline in crude oil prices is already being felt in rural communities that depend on the oil industry. In Karnes City, Texas, Rudy Martinez, who rents out rooms to oilfield workers, has seen a significant drop in business.\n\n\"I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts,\" Martinez said. He added that the workers, who used to pay up to $2000 a week per person, can no longer afford his $100 per person per week rate.\n\nThe decline in oil prices is a stark contrast to the boom in Karnes City a decade ago, when local farmers and ranchers received large oil royalty checks. Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman recalls, \"There were local farmers and ranchers who were just getting by, then all of a sudden showed up at my bank with a $1 million oil royalty check in hand.\"\n\nThe oil industry's struggles stem from a combination of factors, including the coronavirus epidemic's threat to world economic growth, reduced demand due to canceled large gatherings and people staying home, and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that began last Sunday.\n\nU.S. oil companies, particularly smaller ones, are now looking to make deep cuts, with industry analysts warning of possible bankruptcies if oil remains in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable.\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly considering other ways to help the oil industry, such as reducing federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore, and offering low-interest government-backed loans. However, not everyone supports these measures. Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace stated, \"The last people who deserve taxpayers' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis.\"\n\nOne potential positive outcome of the current situation is lower gas prices for motorists in the coming months. However, with many limiting travel due to coronavirus concerns, increased consumption, typically seen when gas prices drop, may not occur this time.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee's Benghazi Report: A Bipartisan Assessment of the 2012 Terrorist Attacks\n\nA bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, released on Wednesday, has laid out findings regarding the assaults on the U.S. diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 and 12, 2012. The report, which spans more than a dozen findings, primarily blames the State Department and intelligence agencies for not preventing the attacks that resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nThe report states that the State Department failed to increase security at the sites despite warnings, and criticizes intelligence agencies for not sharing information about the existence of the CIA outpost with the U.S. military. The committee determined that the U.S. military command in Africa didn't know about the CIA annex and didn't have the resources to defend the diplomatic compound in an emergency.\n\nThe report also specifies the involvement of four Al-Qaeda-linked groups in the attacks, contradicting previous reports that Al-Qaeda played no role in the lethal siege. The Senate Intelligence Committee's report names Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as official branches of Al-Qaeda that were involved in the attacks.\n\nThe report also highlights the State Department's failure to heed security warnings, the intelligence community's provision of numerous, stark warnings of the terrorist threat in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attack, and the State Department's lack of intelligence analysis post-attack, which shows an \"unsettling\" lack of concern.\n\nThe report also alleges that the Obama administration unnecessarily hampered the committee's review, and Republican committee members have accused the administration of withholding relevant documentation. The Senate Intelligence Committee's assessment comes on the heels of a Fox News report confirming that U.S. officials knew that the Benghazi attacks were acts of terrorism within minutes.\n\nThe report has been met with criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some arguing that the report is a whitewash, while others argue that it is a fair and unsparing assessment of the events leading up to the attacks. The accountability scoreboard, as noted by CBS News, currently stands at zero, with no one held accountable for the events that transpired in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.",
    " Title: Global Stocks Plummet as Coronavirus Cases Surpass 200,000, Triggering Market Volatility and Economic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tumultuous trading session on Wednesday, global stocks took a significant hit, plunging to a three-year low as the worldwide tally of coronavirus cases surpassed 200,000. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has prompted governments worldwide to consider stimulus measures and stringent restrictions to curb the spread. However, the economic impact is already palpable, with several indicators showing a sharp decline, and Wall Street predicting a recession in 2020.\n\nJPMorgan Chase economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note on Wednesday, \"There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 1,300 points during Wednesday's session, settling below the psychologically-important level of 20,000\u2014its lowest close since February 2017 and deep in bear market territory. The oil market's demand and supply issues have also pushed the commodity to its lowest levels in nearly two decades.\n\nThe S&P 500 plummeted, triggering a market-wide temporary halt to trading before closing down by over 5% on the day. This was the second time in three days the blue-chip index invoked a so-called \"circuit breaker\" during regular trading, a measure intended to prevent extreme losses.\n\nInvestors remain on edge as one major economy after another shuts its borders to contain the outbreak and grapple with the financial and economic disaster left in the wake of COVID-19. The U.S. administration is finalizing a fiscal stimulus package to counter the effects of the pandemic. With both Democrats and Republicans agreeing on the urgent need for consumer support, the stimulus is expected to exceed $1 trillion.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate approved a bill that would provide for sick leave, expanded job benefits, and coronavirus testing. According to Eurasia Group's Todd Mariano, \"The most powerful factor spurring Congress forward will continue to be the deterioration of the U.S. economy as it experiences a historic shutdown. More than anything else, even outweighing electoral considerations, this has served to supersede partisan politics and concentrate minds in lightning fashion over the past ten days, and that will likely continue over the next few weeks.\"\n\nMonetary policymakers also stepped in with further stimulus on Tuesday. In a move anticipated by many market participants, the Federal Reserve announced Tuesday it would be relaunching its financial crisis-era Commercial Paper Funding Facility, a program designed to help U.S. companies gain increased access to financing amid the pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nVolatility stemming from the outbreak has seen the Dow move up or down by 1000 points or more for 8 straight days, and 11 times total in the last month, according to Yahoo Finance data.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton's Call for Honoring Obama's Healthcare Promises Faces Challenges in Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, former President Bill Clinton has called for President Barack Obama to honor his commitment to allow Americans to keep their health insurance plans, despite the cancellation notices sent out by insurance companies. Clinton's statement, made in an interview with Ozy.com, has sparked debate over his motives and the feasibility of his advice.\n\nClinton, known for his skill in verbal maneuvering, suggested that the president should uphold the federal government's commitment to those affected by the cancellations. However, the crux of the issue lies in the fact that Obama's promise was, in part, impossible to fulfill due to the central premise of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nThe cancellation of current insurance plans is not an unintended consequence of the law but a necessary one to ensure the law's functionality. The individual insurance market, which contains those content with their current coverage, must be emptied for the health insurance exchanges to function effectively.\n\nThe White House's stance is that the president is sorry for any confusion and wants people to keep their coverage, but it is impossible due to the law's structure. This has led to a political backlash, as the costs of the law, such as canceled policies and higher premiums, are immediate and concrete, making the politics of Obamacare increasingly toxic.\n\nThe Obama administration is currently exploring administrative \"fixes\" to address the cancellation issue, but the long-term viability of these solutions remains uncertain. The political landscape is further complicated by the fact that some Democrats are supporting legislation to grandfather canceled insurance policies, a move opposed by the White House.\n\nIn essence, the Obama administration finds itself in a difficult position, with Bill Clinton, a fellow Democrat, urging the president to honor his word, but the president's hands may be tied by the intricacies of the Affordable Care Act. The future of healthcare reform remains uncertain, as the administration navigates the complexities of the law and the political fallout from its implementation.",
    " Title: Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Criticizes Amazon's Decision to Establish HQ2 in Long Island City, Queens\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising figure on the liberal left, has criticized Amazon's decision to locate half of its second headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. In a series of tweets, she expressed concern over the reported tax breaks the company will receive and highlighted the local community's reported outrage.\n\nThe Democrat's stance on Amazon puts her at odds with some of New York's top Democrats, including Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who have been involved in negotiations over the deal. Ocasio-Cortez's position may further solidify her status as an outsider among New York's establishment Democrats, many of whom endorsed Joe Crowley, the longtime incumbent House member she unseated in the Democratic primary.\n\nOcasio-Cortez criticized the tax breaks reportedly offered by the state's economic development arm, Empire State Development. She suggested they may come at the expense of critical pieces of the city's infrastructure, such as its mass transit and public housing, which face billions of dollars in repair needs.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted late Monday night. \"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\"\n\nAmazon's split decision means the selected locations can expect to share as many as 50,000 jobs and roughly $5 billion in investment. New York and Arlington, Va.'s Crystal City neighborhood won the Amazon competition, beating out places including Newark, N.J., Boston, and Austin, Texas. Ocasio-Cortez's district includes parts of Queens adjacent to Long Island City, including Sunnyside and parts of Astoria.\n\nState and local officials are expected to make an official announcement on Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the plans told \u2588\u2588\u2588 late Monday.\n\nOcasio-Cortez emphasized the need for substantial benefits for the surrounding community, which is home to the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in the country.\n\n\"We need to focus on good healthcare, living wages, affordable rent. Corporations that offer none of those things should be met with skepticism,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \"It's possible to establish economic partnerships with real opportunities for working families, instead of a race-to-the-bottom competition.\"\n\n\"Lastly, this isn't just about one company or one headquarters,\" she said in a tweet sent Tuesday shortly after midnight. \"It's about cost of living, corps paying their fair share, etc. It's not about picking a fight, either. I was elected to advocate for our community's interests\u2014and they've requested, clearly, to voice their concerns.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, is set to become the youngest member of Congress when she's inaugurated next year following her upset victory over Crowley.",
    " Title: Frustration Mounts as Jeb Bush Struggles in Presidential Race, Donors and Supporters Contemplate Exit Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the New Hampshire primary, frustration within the Bush camp is becoming increasingly apparent, with even the most ardent family loyalists acknowledging the possibility that it may be time for Jeb Bush to exit the race. With the primary just days away and polls showing him still trailing Marco Rubio, there is a growing sense that the former Florida governor is running out of time to demonstrate strength.\n\nMany donors and influential supporters, bound by a deep and longstanding connection to the Bush family, say they will remain with Bush as long as he is in the race. However, others, deeply distressed by the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and eager for the Republican Party to rally around a mainstream candidate with viability, say they have come to terms with Bush's long odds and the possibility they will eventually get behind someone else.\n\n\"I acknowledge reality. There's going to be three or four candidates remaining after New Hampshire,\" said former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber, a Jeb Bush adviser who also worked on George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. \"I think the field is going to narrow pretty quickly. We'll see what happens in South Carolina, and from there you can see the dynamic starting to winnow the field pretty quickly.\"\n\nWhile Weber said he would remain with Bush as long as he was in the race, others said they may soon head for the exits. Barring a strong showing, they said, Wednesday could be a day of deep reflection for them.\n\n\"If he doesn't do well in New Hampshire, I think he needs to think long and hard about what he wants to do,\" said one top Bush fundraiser who played a key role in his brother's administration.\n\nAnother high-profile Bush financial backer, who has also been close to the family for years, said most of Bush's donors would give him until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20. \"That's when they say, 'Enough.'\"\n\nThere is still some reason for optimism. If recent polls are to be believed, Bush has climbed to within striking distance of second place, putting him in a head-to-head competition with his chief rival, Rubio. And he might have more upside after Saturday night, when Bush emerged relatively unscathed from the GOP debate while Rubio stumbled badly under a barrage of attacks, largely from Chris Christie.\n\nYet Bush's top aides are still struggling to keep restless supporters in line. On Thursday, three days after the former governor barely registered in the Iowa caucuses, the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise held a conference call with top donors to outline the path forward. At one point, Mike Murphy, a longtime top Bush adviser who oversees Right to Rise, was pressed by a donor on why the super PAC's substantial spending had yet to improve the former governor's poll numbers.\n\nFor Bush's supporters, the question of whether to desert him is a complicated one. Bush's network of loyal donors and political supporters is far more extensive than that of any of his rivals. The ties between them and the Bush family \u2013 to which many of them remain deeply indebted \u2013 are strong and long-lasting. This weekend, dozens of longtime Bush family friends and supporters from across the country descended on New Hampshire to trudge through the snow and knock on doors.\n\n\"There's no question that some of us have had long relationships with the family, from Prescott Bush to George W. Bush. Most of the folks I know who were with us in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004 and here with us now,\" said Lawrence Bathgate, the Republican National Committee finance chairman under President George H.W. Bush, pointing to the family's long list of presidential campaigns. \"I have no intention of leaving the team at all and I think most people feel the same way.\"\n\nIf some backers do begin to walk away, it could alter the trajectory of the campaign. The former governor, who has raised well over $120 million, has a deep well of donors who could go on to fill another contender's coffers.\n\nTo date, Bush has lost relatively few high-profile contributors. One exception came in November when Brian Ballard, a top Florida-based fundraiser, announced he was ditching the campaign over disagreements over strategy.\n\nSome say they are hesitant to leave Bush because there is a growing sense that he has no intention of departing the race soon. He has said publicly to supporters, and privately to senior aides, that he will fight on to South Carolina and his team has begun planning a campaign event there with George W. Bush. His campaign is getting ready to send a bus of Bush loyalists from Washington, D.C. to South Carolina.\n\nTo many of Bush's closest followers, the thought of him dropping out is almost unthinkable \u2013 particularly if Rubio emerges as the leading establishment candidate. Among Bush's top advisers, the dislike of Rubio \u2013 who for years was a junior figure to Bush in Florida politics and is seen as deeply disloyal \u2013 is intense. One top Bush fundraiser said that on conference calls with the campaign Rubio has been called \"Judas,\" a reference to the biblical figure who had betrayed Jesus.\n\nBut with the governor struggling, some \u2013 for all their feelings of closeness to the family \u2013 hint that they are beginning to think about the possibility of a 2016 campaign without him.\n\n\"One thing I am is a loyal guy and I'm loyal to the Bush family. It's been a wild ride,\" said Francis Rooney, who served as an ambassador under George W. Bush and has been a major donor to Jeb Bush's campaign. \"Sooner or later the process is going to unfold and we'll see who gains traction.\"\n\nAt times in recent weeks, the gloomy outlook in the campaign has been interrupted by moments of humor.\n\nShortly after kicking off the Right to Rise conference call last week, Murphy introduced himself to listeners and began his initial remarks. Then, he was suddenly interrupted.\n\n\"Ah, f-- you,\" one person on the line blurted out.\n\nThere was silence. Those on the call wondered: Was a frustrated donor, unhappy about Bush's lagging poll numbers and his crushing defeat in Iowa, directing venom toward Murphy?\n\n(As it turned out, the expletive-using caller was none other than Charlie Spies, the veteran Republican election attorney who represents Right to Rise. Spies had been cut off by a driver and had forgotten to turn on his mute button, though at the time the listeners on the call \u2013 and Murphy \u2013 didn't know that.)",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Vow to Reverse Obama's Foreign Policy Legacy, Setting Up Potential Policy Reversals in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, foreign policy has emerged as a key issue, with several Republican candidates vowing to reverse key foreign policy achievements of the Obama administration. This development has led some to label Obama's foreign policy as the \"Obamacare of the 2016 election,\" with Republicans promising to repeal the president's acts as soon as a Republican takes office.\n\nOne of the most prominent issues is the normalization of relations with Cuba. In his second term, President Obama has been working to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in over half a century. The U.S. has also been negotiating a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Several GOP presidential contenders, including Sen. Marco Rubio, have vowed to reverse these policies.\n\nRubio, who is Cuban-American, made his presidential campaign announcement at Miami's Freedom Tower, a historic site where Cuban exiles fleeing Fidel Castro's regime once received federal support. Rubio, a fierce critic of Cuba's government and of warming U.S. relations with it, has stated that he would re-break diplomatic relations with Cuba if elected.\n\nSimilarly, Rubio has also expressed his intention to reverse the U.S.'s deal with Iran. He contends that what one president gives, the next may take away. Rubio says he would re-impose sanctions, even if other world powers and the United Nations failed to follow suit. Such a move could lead to a new confrontation with Iran.\n\nThe prospect of such dramatic foreign policy reversals raises questions about the feasibility of these actions. A president can break diplomatic relations with Cuba, even if they've just been restored. However, supporters of Obama's Cuba policy expect a different dynamic. The U.S. opening to Cuba may in time bring economic opportunities. American entrepreneurs won't be clamoring to rupture ties again; they will be clamoring to modify the longstanding economic embargo against Cuba that blocks U.S. business deals.\n\nIn theory, a president could also tear up an agreement made by his predecessor. However, the Iran deal, a notion mentioned in an open letter to Iran signed by 47 Republican senators, has been met with resistance. Iran's foreign minister insisted an agreement would be binding on the United States, and withdrawal from it would be a \"blatant violation of international law.\"\n\nObama has been critical of the Republican candidates' stance on foreign policy. In an interview this month, he stated that the idea of breaking the Iran deal on \"Day 1\" was a \"foolish\" idea, which would undermine the presidency and suggested that the candidates would agree \"after they've taken some time to bone up on foreign policy.\"\n\nAs the 2016 election approaches, foreign policy discussions are prevalent among the candidates. Republicans are running against the retiring president's foreign policy legacy, which means they also get one more chance\u2014one last chance\u2014to run against Obama. The outcome of these policy reversals remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: foreign policy will continue to be a key issue in the 2016 election.",
    " Title: A Call for Debate: The Necessity and Limitations of Gun Control in the Aftermath of Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas, a heated debate has erupted over the need for stricter gun control laws in the United States. This article aims to present a neutral perspective on the issue, examining the arguments for and against increased regulation of firearms.\n\nTo resist an immediate call for more stringent gun laws or enforcement in the wake of tragedies like Las Vegas, one must first acknowledge that existing laws and regulations may not reliably prevent such incidents. As Jacob Sullum explained at Reason, new or expanded national gun control laws, even if perfectly enforced, would have had no effect on the Las Vegas shooting.\n\nThe proponents of gun control argue that the only relevant legal response to such tragedies is a total ban and confiscation of certain types of weapons, such as \"assault rifles.\" This stance is based on the belief that these weapons are disproportionately used in mass shootings, and their elimination could significantly reduce the number of such incidents.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of stricter gun control argue for a measured, proportionate response to gun violence. They contend that the prevalence of guns in the United States, and the fact that millions of rifles are owned peacefully and legally, makes a total ban impractical and potentially unconstitutional.\n\nIt is essential to consider the context of gun violence in the United States. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, in the three years prior to 2017, rifles were used in murders four known times in Nevada, a state often cited for its \"lax\" gun laws. However, when accounting for murders where the type of gun used is unknown, the number of rifle murders in Nevada increases to 24 over the same period, representing 4% of total murders in the state. In contrast, killers used hands or fists to murder 25 times during the same period.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to recognize that guns are tools, with legitimate uses for personal safety, personal fulfillment, and convenience, just as cars, for example. The unwillingness to leap to a legal solution to mass gun murders requires acknowledging that guns are tools, with a tiny number of people who own or have access to these specific tools ever using them to harm another human.\n\nThe debate over gun control is complex and emotionally charged, with valid arguments on both sides. It is essential to approach the issue with an open mind, recognizing the need for a balanced, measured response that considers the realities of gun violence in the United States, the potential consequences of stricter gun control, and the value of the Second Amendment.\n\nIn conclusion, the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting has reignited the debate over gun control in the United States. While it is clear that something must be done to address the issue of gun violence, it is equally important to consider the potential consequences of stricter gun control and the value of the Second Amendment. A balanced, measured response that acknowledges the complexities of gun violence and the legitimate uses of firearms is necessary to find a solution that protects both public safety and individual rights.",
    " Title: US-China Climate Agreement: A Significant Step Towards Emissions Reduction, but Falls Short of 2-Degree Target\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, have announced a historic agreement to reduce their carbon emissions. The US has pledged to cut emissions by 26-28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels, while China has committed to peak its emissions by 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 20% by the same date.\n\nThe agreement, while significant, does not put the US on a pathway to the 2-degree Celsius target that scientists believe is the threshold of danger. \"This does not put us on a pathway to 2 degrees,\" said Samantha Smith, a climate change expert from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\nThe agreement marks a first for China, as it is the first time they have named a date when their emissions will peak. However, the deal is not a result of a philosophical determination to save the planet, but rather a political necessity for both countries.\n\nPresident Obama needs to show the US Congress and public that he can create a level playing field for American industry to compete with China. President Xi Jinping, on the other hand, needs to demonstrate significant efforts to clean the air by reducing the use of coal, while maintaining China's efforts to lift people out of poverty.\n\nThe agreement received a muted welcome from the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), a group of countries facing threats from rising sea levels. Aosis ministers said they look forward to more detailed information about how the commitments match up against what is needed to ensure a safe global climate.\n\nThe real significance of the US-China deal lies in the changes it signals in the United Nations political process. Every nation has committed to agreeing a new deal by the time the parties gather in Paris next year. The negotiators will meet in Peru next month to draft the text of that agreement.\n\nThe Beijing deal is significant because it underlines the fact that China is changing its position. According to Liz Gallagher from environmental think-tank E3G, the deal signals a shift, with China no longer viewing itself as a developing country but as a transitioning economy.\n\nThe agreement should also put pressure on some developed countries who have been moving away from tackling emissions. \"The ball is in play, so now others, not just developing countries but the likes of Japan, Canada, and Australia, there is now pressure on them to come forward with something themselves,\" said Samantha Smith.\n\nTaken together with the EU's recent announcement of new climate targets for 2030, one could be forgiven for thinking that a deal in Paris is in the bag. However, cutting emissions is just one part of the negotiations, and for many countries, the least important bit. For many, the bigger questions are about cash to cope with the impact of climate change.\n\nMany nations want a financial mechanism that would put a legal responsibility on those who have done most to cause climate change to compensate those who suffer most from it. This is a potential iceberg for the whole process. \"There is a need for the developing countries to see that there would be certainty in terms of future flows of finance, otherwise we won't see much ownership of this process from many of the parties in Paris,\" said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, a senior negotiator from the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
    " Title: Unfamiliar Faces: A Third of Voters Unaware of Their Congressional Candidates Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK - With less than five weeks remaining before the midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress for the next two years, a significant number of registered voters are unaware of their party's candidate for office, according to a poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos.\n\nThe poll found that 34 percent of Republican registered voters and 32.5 percent of Democratic registered voters do not know the names of their party's congressional candidates in their districts. The poll of 2,597 registered voters taken Sept. 24-30 had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.\n\nName recognition is crucial in motivating voters, and candidates spend millions of dollars on TV ads to ensure their names are known. However, this year, many voters may view their choices as referendums on a man whose name will not be on the ballot: Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nRobert Erikson, a professor of political science at Columbia University in New York City, wrote in an email that with the current party polarization, voters increasingly vote based on their feelings towards Trump rather than the local candidates.\n\nThe level of congressional candidate name recognition is about in line with recent elections, said Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina. \"People aren't voting for their side as much as they are voting against the other side,\" Hetherington said. \"It really doesn't matter what the names are these days.\"\n\nBeyond party and name recognition, gender may play a role in voters' decisions this year. Michael Cornfield, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, noted that the #MeToo movement and protests around Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have influenced this trend.\n\n\"In these cases, it's not just the name. Gender relations may be the top issue,\" Cornfield said in an email.\n\nThe poll also showed that 54 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of the way Trump is handling the presidency, and Democrats have a 9 percentage point lead in a generic question on which party they expect to vote for in Congress. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House to win a majority that they could use to more effectively oppose Trump's agenda.",
    " Title: Trump and Cruz Unite in Texas: A Political Rally and a Shift in Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, who were once political adversaries, have found common ground at a rally in Texas on Monday. The event, which attracted a large crowd, saw Trump endorsing Cruz for re-election, describing the senator as \"a really good friend of mine.\"\n\nThe rally, held in Houston, was a significant one for the Republican party, as the fragile majority they hold in the Senate is crucial for Trump's legislative agenda, including his proposed border wall. Trump urged voters to re-elect Cruz, stating, \"Together, with a lot of other great Republicans, we are defending your freedom.\"\n\nThe event, which was shifted to a larger arena due to high interest, according to Trump's campaign, was well-attended, although the Toyota Arena, which holds 18,000, was not at capacity during the rally. The Trump campaign reported that 100,000 people had expressed interest in the free tickets.\n\nWhile Cruz is currently leading in polls, two weeks before the election, his Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, has made a notable impression on voters across the state. The Democratic Party has long looked to Texas, hoping to capitalize on shifting demographics in the big cities, while Republicans have relied on it as a solid block across the south and southwest.\n\nHowever, many voters interviewed by The Wall Street Journal stated that they would likely vote for Cruz in the midterm election next month, but their primary reason for attending the rally was to see Trump. One such voter, Rick LaBlanc, a retired oil industry executive, said, \"I do like Ted Cruz a lot but I'm here to see Donald Trump. I'm a Trump man.\"\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Cruz has evolved significantly since their bitter exchanges during the 2016 presidential campaign. Cruz has since become an outspoken advocate for Trump's policies, including immigration crackdowns, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the nomination of conservative judges to the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump praised Cruz for his role in the recent Supreme Court battle, calling it a \"victory\" and commending Cruz for \"staring down an angry left-wing mob.\" The two men also took aim at O'Rourke, with Trump labeling him as a \"radical, open borders left-winger,\" and Cruz referring to him as a \"gun-grabbing liberal.\"\n\nThe O'Rourke campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a reflection of their evolving relationship, Trump acknowledged the past difficulties between him and Cruz but emphasized their current alliance, stating, \"We had our little difficulties, but actually, if you remember in the beginning it was a lovefest...then it got nasty. And then it ended, and I'll tell you what nobody has helped me more.\"",
    " Title: Alabama Officials Reject Federal Plan to House Coronavirus-Positive Cruise Ship Passengers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, state officials in Alabama have rejected a federal plan to house passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who tested positive for the coronavirus at a facility in Anniston, potentially forcing authorities to reconsider the idea.\n\nGlobally, the death toll from the virus surpassed 2,600 on Sunday night, with over 79,000 confirmed cases. The U.S. currently has 35 confirmed cases.\n\nThe federal plan, proposed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, aimed to use the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston as a quarantine center for some American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess. Most of the evacuees are currently housed at military bases in Texas, Colorado, and California.\n\nThe plan, which called for the Anniston facility due to its \"unique facilities,\" would have only admitted passengers with minor or no symptoms. Those who became seriously ill would have been taken to \"pre-identified\" hospitals, HHS said.\n\nHowever, the plan was met with a swift and negative response from Alabama's mayor, governor, and multiple congressmen.\n\nRep. Bradley Byrne expressed his opposition on Twitter, stating, \"The people of Alabama DO NOT want the coronavirus brought here.\" He further added, \"I\u2019m fighting to bring this to a full stop. Leave these people in the place they came from, don\u2019t spread them around the US, and keep them OUT of Alabama. The risk is much too high.\"\n\nRep. Mike Rogers claimed he had spoken with President Donald Trump, who Rogers said agreed that the HHS plan was the \"wrong decision.\"\n\nGov. Kay Ivey also voiced her concerns, stating that the HHS announcement was \"inadvertently, and perhaps prematurely, sent.\" She clarified that Anniston was being considered only as a backup plan and that no decision had been made to send anyone to Anniston.\n\nWorldwide, South Korea went on its highest alert Sunday, reporting its sixth and seventh coronavirus deaths and announcing that cases have surpassed 760. President Moon Jae-in raised the virus alert level to red, the highest in its four-tier system, for the first time in more than a decade. Schools that were supposed to open in a week will be delayed until March 9.\n\nIn China, President Xi Jinping pledged unrelenting efforts to control the outbreak that has killed over 2,400 of his countrymen. \"The epidemic situation remains grim and complex,\" Xi told state media. More than 77,000 of the infection cases are in mainland China.\n\nThe silver lining: More than 24,000 of those patients have been confirmed as \"totally recovered.\"\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani issued a decree setting up a national committee for managing the epidemic in Iran, which has reported eight deaths and 43 cases. Cultural centers, schools, and universities in 14 provinces were ordered closed, and Turkey closed its border with Iran. Sylvie Briand, director of global infectious hazard preparedness at the World Health Organization, expressed concern over the \"very rapid increase in a matter of a few days\" in Iran.",
    " Title: Journalist Challenges Political Perspectives on Executive Power and Civil Liberties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, journalist Glenn Greenwald emphasized the long-term implications of granting executive powers and the potential erosion of civil liberties. He argued that such powers, once acquired, tend to become permanent, regardless of the political leanings of the current administration. Greenwald's statement comes amidst the ongoing debate surrounding the Obama administration's handling of executive power.\n\nGreenwald's perspective, however, seems to contrast with that of Obama's supporters, who express concerns about a potential Romney-Ryan administration's approach to civil liberties and foreign policy. Greenwald, in his statement, questions the apparent short-sightedness of these supporters, who, despite the possibility of a future Republican presidency, do not seem to be urging Obama to limit executive power.\n\nThe debate has seen a polarized discourse, with some Republicans criticizing Obama's policies, while others, like Sarah Palin, have been vocal about issues such as the Medicare treatment review board, labeling it a \"death panel.\" However, these same critics appear to be accepting of Obama's controversial actions, such as the targeted killing of American citizens.\n\nGreenwald's statement underscores the urgency of addressing these issues, particularly in light of the upcoming elections. He emphasizes the need to defeat Romney and Ryan, citing their perceived bellicose nature and disregard for the less affluent. However, his statement also raises questions about the potential dangers of overly critical characterizations of political opponents, suggesting that such characterizations may not accurately reflect the true intentions or actions of those in power.\n\nFurthermore, Greenwald's statement touches on the issue of privilege, suggesting that the ability to engage in such discussions is a privilege in itself. This point, while not directly addressing the core issue of executive power and civil liberties, adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing debate.\n\nIn conclusion, Greenwald's statement serves as a reminder of the importance of balanced and informed discourse in the face of polarizing political issues. It encourages a nuanced understanding of the implications of executive power and the need for vigilance in the face of potential abuses, regardless of the political affiliation of the current administration.",
    " Title: Hurricane Sandy Overshadows Presidential Campaign in Final Days, Leaving Romney Struggling for Attention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of the presidential race, the impact of Hurricane Sandy has overshadowed the campaign, leaving Mitt Romney struggling for media attention. The superstorm has dominated news coverage, interrupting the regular news cycle and prompting prime-time specials.\n\n\"It interrupted the news cycle at a time when there were favorable horse race stories for Mitt,\" says Tom Rath, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. \"In a campaign, you do not get to design the racetrack; you play the cards you're dealt.\"\n\nRomney has been sensitive to the devastation caused by the storm, collecting donated food in Ohio on Tuesday, calling for donations to the American Red Cross, and sending out messages of sympathy. However, he has not commanded the same amount of attention that President Obama naturally attracts, given his role in heading up the federal government's response to the storm and cleanup efforts.\n\nObama was touring New Jersey Wednesday with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who has praised Obama for his handling of the disaster. Romney was campaigning in Florida.\n\n\"The attention is all on the president,\" says William Schneider, a senior fellow at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \"It's going to be a little harder for [Romney] to argue that this is a failed presidency, because the president appears to have performed well in this crisis.\"\n\nSandy may not pay any direct political dividends for Obama. People expect their leaders to step up at times of crisis. \"I don't see a rallying-around-the-president effect,\" says David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.\n\nThe storm is also unlikely to reshape the electoral map, given that the worst of the destruction occurred in northeastern states that were considered certain to vote for Obama.\n\nAs more days pass without much media attention paid to the campaign, it becomes increasingly difficult for Romney to erase Obama's thin polling leads in the battleground states that matter most.\n\nFor all the talk over the years about \"October surprises\" \u2014 late-breaking news stories that were thought to sway voters or divert attention from the presidential race \u2014 Yepsen says there's never been an event as dominant as Sandy in the closing weeks of any campaign.\n\n\"This is a seismic national tragedy,\" he says. \"I don't think there's anything that Romney or the president can do. This is a story in which the narrative has to play out for a few days.\"\n\nSpeaking strictly in terms of media attention, though, all hot stories eventually cool off. With any major news event, there's a point at which most media outlets decide they've reached a saturation point and begin dialing back the coverage \u2014 at least outside the affected areas.\n\nCertainly, the presidential election will take precedence in terms of media coverage at some point between now and next Tuesday. It's hard to know exactly when that might happen, though. Schneider, who is also a public policy professor at George Mason University, suggests that Friday's jobs report might change the subject \u2014 particularly if unemployment numbers are looking worse than they were in September.\n\n\"Romney has to broaden the issue to the last four years, not the last few days,\" Schneider says.\n\nEven if Romney is not able to get much attention for final rallies and appeals \u2014 and Obama does not turn his attention to campaigning, either \u2014 it may not matter much, suggests David Carney, a Republican consultant.\n\nVoters have already heard just about enough of this campaign. The vast majority of Americans seem to have made up their minds early in the process. And, especially with millions having voted early, it's not clear that a strong closing argument from a candidate or a bit more coverage from the media would change the eventual outcome.\n\n\"Traditionally, in the last week of the campaign, the messages have all been sent, and it's really about turning out your voters,\" Carney says. \"If the 65 trillion TV ads have not affected you yet, there is not a week of TV or some new slogan that can move you one way or another.\"\n\nRath, the Romney adviser, suggests that voters are sufficiently invested in the presidential race to want to make their choices known, regardless of the shape and coverage of any final campaign sprint, or lack thereof.\n\n\"Everybody is overwhelmed and moved by the pictures, which are compelling beyond measure, but at the end of the day, they'll think, 'We've got to vote,'\" Rath says. \"The American people are going to say, after putting up with this race for 18 months, 'It's time for me to make my decision.'\"",
    " Title: Delay in GOP Lawsuit Against President Obama: What Happened to the Anticipated Legal Challenge?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the much-anticipated lawsuit by House Republicans against President Barack Obama, announced in June, has yet to materialize four months later. The lawsuit, which aimed to challenge the president's constitutional authority over the implementation of certain provisions of the Obamacare law, was initially expected to be a significant rallying point for the Republican party during the election season.\n\nHowever, legal action seems to have stalled, with no signs of the lawsuit being filed before the midterm elections. Lawyers close to the process had initially anticipated the legal challenge to be filed in September, but now they do not expect any action before the elections.\n\nThe delay in filing the lawsuit has led to speculation among political analysts. Some attribute the delay to electoral politics, suggesting that Republicans were concerned that the lawsuit could stir up the Democratic base. The GOP has remained silent on the reasons for the delay.\n\nThe core of the suit was expected to center on the employer mandate provision, which President Obama twice delayed but is now set to kick in for many employers on Jan. 1. The delay in filing the lawsuit means that the core of the suit could effectively be moot before the Obama administration even responds to it in court.\n\nFormer House Counsel Stan Brand, a Democrat, expressed his surprise at the delay, stating, \"I thought this was a constitutional crisis and the republic was in jeopardy because Obama overstepped his bounds. Now, they can\u2019t even get around to filing it?\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner stated that the date for filing the litigation remains undecided. \"No decisions on timing at this point,\" spokesman Kevin Smith said Friday. He declined to comment on speculation about the reasons for the delay.\n\nSome Democrats suspect the filing has been delayed due to the backlash from Boehner's announcement of the suit over the summer, which spurred fundraising by Democratic committees. Raising the issue again so close to the election could agitate those in the president's base who view such a lawsuit as disrespectful and part of an effort to delegitimize Obama.\n\nDemocratic consultant David DiMartino argued, \"I think it goes beyond the Democratic base in terms of the Americans who thought this was beyond the pale. Republican leaders are really good at finding really efficient ways to alienate huge swaths of the American public, and this is one of those issues.\"\n\nSome conservatives, however, see the suit's postponement until after the election as important to rebutting charges that it's only about politics. Todd Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation stated, \"After the election, it ought to garner more serious commentary, evaluation, and judicial review. It can have some very helpful consequences for a principle that I think liberals and conservatives should both be concerned about, and that is the president's unilateral authority to rewrite a statute in dozens of ways.\"",
    " Title: Pentagon to Allow Transgender Recruits as Legal Challenges Mount Against Trump's Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Defense Department has confirmed that it will allow transgender individuals to enlist in the military starting January 1, 2023, following a federal court order. This move comes despite President Trump's summer announcement of a ban on transgender servicemembers, which has since been challenged in the courts.\n\nThe new policy reflects the growing legal pressure on the issue and the challenges the federal government would face in enforcing Trump's demand. Potential transgender recruits will still need to meet a rigorous set of physical, medical, and mental conditions to join the armed services.\n\nMaj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the enlistment of transgender recruits will commence on January 1 and continue amid ongoing legal battles. The Defense Department is also studying the issue further.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition, and those who have undergone reconstruction. However, such recruits are allowed if a medical provider certifies they have been clinically stable in their preferred gender for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas.\n\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\n\nLast year, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender service members, allowing them to serve openly in the military. He stated that within 12 months, or by July 2017, transgender people would also be able to enlist.\n\nHowever, Trump, via Twitter, announced in July that the federal government \"will not accept or allow\" transgender troops to serve \"in any capacity\" in the military. A month later, he issued a formal order telling the Pentagon to extend the ban. He gave the department six months to determine what to do about those currently serving.\n\nTrump's decision was quickly challenged in court, and two U.S. district court judges have already ruled against the ban. Part of one ruling required the government to allow transgender individuals to enlist beginning January 1.\n\n\"We disagree with the Court's ruling and are seeking to stay the Defense Department's obligations under that ruling as we evaluate next steps. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit challenging military service requirements is premature for many reasons, including that the Defense Department is actively reviewing such service requirements, as the President ordered, and because none of the Plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam told Fox News.\n\nThe government had asked that the January 1 requirement be put on hold while the appeal proceeds. The Pentagon's move on Monday suggests a growing sense within the government that authorities are likely to lose the legal fight.",
    " Title: \"Edward Snowden's Asylum in Russia and Ongoing Investigation into NSA Leaks\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, former NSA and CIA deputy director Richard Ledgett expressed openness to discussing the potential implications of Edward Snowden's actions, but emphasized the need for assurances that any remaining data could be secured. Snowden, who has been living in Russia under a one-year asylum, has been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on charges of espionage and theft of government property.\n\nSnowden has expressed a willingness to return to the United States if offered amnesty, but it remains uncertain whether President Obama, who would likely have to make such a decision, would extend such an offer. The damage that Snowden's leaks have allegedly caused to national security is a point of contention for the administration.\n\nThe NSA is still uncertain about the extent of the data Snowden took, with government officials sometimes learning about specific documents from reporters preparing their articles for publication, leaving little time for the State Department to notify foreign leaders about incoming disclosures. The security agency is currently in the process of revamping its computer network in the aftermath of what could be the largest breach of classified information in American history.\n\nThe Justice Department has continued its investigation of Snowden, with FBI agents from the Washington field office, leading the investigation, believing that Snowden methodically downloaded the files over several months while working as a government contractor at the Hawaii facility. They also believe that he worked alone, according to senior government officials.\n\nDespite Snowden's technical expertise, some American officials also place blame on the security agency for being slow to install software that can detect unusual computer activity carried out by the agency's workforce, which, at approximately 35,000 employees, is the largest of any intelligence agency.",
    " Title: \"Tahrir al-Sham: The Evolution of Extremist Recruitment and the Emerging Digital Battlefield\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a video, now deleted from YouTube, showcases a young man, dressed in the attire of a modern jihadist, calling for the recruitment of fighters to defend the fronts in Syria and Iraq. The video, which was uploaded in early November, is not a traditional recruitment video but an extremist version of a Kickstarter campaign, aiming to sign up new fighters through the anonymous Telegram app. The group behind this campaign is not al-Qaeda or ISIS, but an umbrella group called the Levant Liberation Committee, also known as Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nTahrir al-Sham, created as a result of a merger between the Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front and other militant groups in Syria, is a group whose fighters are younger and less religious, not tied to a geographic caliphate like ISIS, and less interested in governance. They are, in other words, more nimble\u2014and more dangerous.\n\nAs a diplomat and scholar who has studied violent extremism, I've seen firsthand how the spread of Tahrir al-Sham's message has alarmed Western intelligence agencies. The group's use of technology, particularly the internet, has become crucial to their operations. With a limited number of dedicated actors, Tahrir could potentially take down local, regional, or even national power grids, disrupt cellphone, GPS, and satellite communications, or hack into government computers and publish classified military and intelligence information, endangering Western agents and assets.\n\nThe group's use of the hidden Telegram channel and Dark Web social networks, which cannot be seen by satellites or destroyed with bombs, makes their activities difficult to detect and censor. Tahrir leaders operate on the principle, \"The narrower the audience, the bigger the impact.\"\n\nThis still-emerging digital battlefield is the least understood component of our ever-changing, 16-year war on terror. Tahrir militants have learned from ISIS's successes and failures on the battlefield, using multiple platforms to amplify their impact. While ISIS sent messages using a broadcast model, Tahrir has experimented with platforms like Sarahah, which allows users to send messages anonymously to one person.\n\nGovernments are still trying to censor ISIS on Twitter, while Tahrir is experimenting with an app that reaches more than 16 million young people and is the top download in over 25 countries, including Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon. Tahrir can fail, quickly measure what resonates, and retool their pitch before the activity is detected by officials. Their speed gives them the advantage.\n\nThis new approach to recruitment and information dissemination by Tahrir al-Sham underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the digital battlefield and the evolving tactics of extremist groups. As the war on terror continues to evolve, so too must our strategies for countering these threats.",
    " Title: \"Congressional Report Estimates 25 Million Americans Exempt from ObamaCare Penalty in 2016\"\n\nA new congressional report has estimated that more than 25 million Americans without health insurance will not be subject to the penalty for not having coverage in 2016 due to an increasing number of ObamaCare exemptions. The Wall Street Journal, citing an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the number of people expected to pay the penalty in 2016 has decreased from the previous projection of six million to four million.\n\nAccording to the report, approximately 30 million Americans are believed to be without health insurance. The latest report is likely to spark fresh concerns among insurers, who have maintained that the number of exemptions to the law's individual mandate are resulting in fewer young, healthy people signing up for health insurance. An insurance pool skewed toward older, comparatively unhealthy people is likely to result in premiums rising.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the penalty for not purchasing health insurance is either $95 per adult or 1 percent of family income, whichever is greater. This amount is set to increase to $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of family income in 2016, with a total family penalty capped at $2,085. The Act provides exemptions to the penalty for certain groups, such as illegal immigrants and members of certain Native American tribes or religious sects. The Obama administration has since added exemptions for hardships like domestic violence, property damage suffered in a fire or flood, or having a health plan canceled when ObamaCare came into effect this past October 1. One exemption, written as being for people who \"experienced another hardship acquiring health insurance,\" does not require documentation.\n\nResidents of 21 states who have opted not to expand their Medicaid program under the health law may also be exempt from the penalty. The Journal reports that more than 4 million Americans who receive subsidies through the federal ObamaCare exchange could qualify for hardship waivers if the subsidies are struck down in court.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was narrowly upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2012 in a ruling based in part on acceptance of the administration's argument that the law's individual mandate was not a tax. Republicans have argued that the Obama administration has undermined its own argument by issuing so many exemptions and should scrap the mandate completely.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the Journal that approximately 77,000 individuals and families have requested an exemption as of this past April. However, that number is expected to rise because many exemption requests can only be claimed on tax returns filed in 2015. The Obama administration has given people whose insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet ObamaCare's minimum coverage requirements an exemption that runs until October 2016. They are also allowed to buy a minimum amount of coverage originally available to people under 30.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Takes Big Step in Same-Sex Marriage Cases, Setting Stage for Potential Resolution\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has taken a significant step in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage by agreeing to hear two cases, one of which seeks to establish a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in the remaining states that prohibit it. The decision comes eight years after Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, and four years after California voters rejected a ruling allowing same-sex marriages in their state.\n\nThe court's decision to hear both cases, rather than just one, has some gay rights advocates bracing for a split decision. The court could strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, arguing that the definition of marriage is a matter for the states to decide. At the same time, it could reject the idea that the Constitution requires states to allow same-sex marriage, stating that the definition of marriage is a matter for the states to decide.\n\nThe speed at which the court is moving has some supporters of traditional marriage sounding optimistic. Brian S. Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, said, \"Taking both cases at the same time exposes the hypocrisy on the other side.\"\n\nThe court's decision could have far-reaching implications, particularly in states that offer gay and lesbian couples all the benefits and burdens of marriage but withhold the name \"marriage.\" Such a ruling could violate equal protection principles, but could also have \"perverse effects,\" according to Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University. States that enact laws allowing gay and lesbian couples to join in civil unions might hesitate, for fear of being forced by the courts to adopt same-sex marriage if they do.\n\nThe court's decision to hear the cases is a departure from the caution of an earlier era, when the court avoided cases that would require giving an answer about the constitutionality of bans on interracial marriage. The Supreme Court did not strike down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967, in the case of Loving v. Virginia.\n\nThe court's decision to hear the cases is a significant development in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage, and could potentially bring a final resolution to the issue in the near future. The court is expected to hear arguments in the cases in March, with a decision likely by the end of June.",
    " Title: Iranian Police Deny Using Live Ammunition Against Protesters Following Downing of Ukrainian Plane\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Iran's admission of responsibility for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane, protests have erupted in the Iranian capital, Tehran. Videos posted online show what appears to be gunfire and injured protesters being carried away. The Tehran police, however, have denied using live ammunition against demonstrators.\n\nThe protests, which went on late into the night on Sunday, were sparked by Iran's acknowledgment that its armed forces mistakenly shot down the Ukraine International Airlines jet, killing all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Canadians. For the first three days after the crash, Iran denied any involvement and suggested a technical failure was the cause.\n\nThe admission of responsibility, which came after video emerged of a missile hitting the plane, has provoked widespread anger in Iran against the establishment. The latest reports of a possible crackdown echo the protests in November over rising fuel prices, during which human rights groups say hundreds of people were killed.\n\nSunday's demonstrations saw protesters venting their fury against the Iranian government and the Revolutionary Guards, who are believed to have shot down the Ukrainian plane. A video posted to social media shows a protester kicking and then ripping down a large poster of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general killed in a US drone strike in Iraq.\n\nThere were reports that a number of people were injured when security forces broke up a protest in Tehran's Azadi Square, during which people chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. One video posted on social media allegedly showed members of the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force attacking protesters in the area.\n\nAnother video shows an injured woman being carried away by people who shout that she has been shot in the leg. A pool of blood is seen on the ground. A protester who saw the injured woman told the BBC: \"They started to come with sticks, they started to beat us. When we started to shout slogans, they started to bombard us with fire, they started to shoot.\"\n\nDespite such reports, Tehran police chief Brig-Gen Hossein Rahimi insisted that his officers did not fire live ammunition at protesters. \"The police treated the people who had gathered with patience and tolerance,\" he said, before warning that \"those who intend to manipulate the situation\" would face consequences.\n\nIranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei meanwhile dismissed as \"crocodile tears\" US President Donald Trump's expressions of support for the protesters. Fresh protests reportedly took place on Monday afternoon outside universities in Tehran and the city of Isfahan.\n\nFootage showed students at the capital's Sharif University of Technology chanting \"They killed our elites and replaced them with clerics\" - a reference to Iranian students who were on flight PS752. The captain of the national men's volleyball team, Said Marouf, wrote on Instagram that he hoped Iran had seen its \"last show\" of \"deceit and stupidity.\"\n\nAnd one of Iran's most famous actresses, Taraneh Alidoosti, posted that Iranians were being treated not as citizens but as \"hostages.\" Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Vadym Prystaiko, told the BBC that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had assured the Ukrainian government in a telephone call that \"no-one who is to [blame] will escape punishment.\"\n\nMr. Prystaiko added that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden, and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. He said the \"grieving nations\" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to \"bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also told a memorial service for the 57 Canadian victims that their country would \"not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve.\" Later, the head of Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB), Kathy Fox, said Iran still had the black boxes from the aircraft, and that they were damaged.\n\nHowever, Ms. Fox said there were early signs that Iran was \"allowing the TSB to play a more active role than normally permitted\" - such as by inviting its investigators to take part in downloading and analyzing data. The Iranian government meanwhile denied there had been a cover-up.\n\n\"On these sad days, numerous criticisms were raised against the country's officials; some of us have been accused of lying and secrecy,\" spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters on Monday. \"But honestly, it was not like that.\"\n\n\"The reality is that we did not lie,\" he added, blaming \"a lack of valid information\" and also \"the US's psychological warfare\" for his own and other officials' denials that the plane was shot down. Mr. Rabiei insisted that senior officials, including President Rouhani, did not know that missiles had been launched at the airliner until Friday evening.\n\nHowever, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force Commander, Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, had said when admitting its role in the \"unintentional\" strike that he had informed officials about it on Wednesday. Gen. Hajizadeh said on Saturday that Iran's air defenses had been on the highest state of alert because the Revolutionary Guards had just fired ballistic missiles at US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.\n\nThe operator of a missile defense system near Tehran's airport mistook flight PS752 for a US missile and due to problems with a communication system was unable to contact the command center, according to the general. \"He had 10 seconds to decide,\" he added. \"He could have decided to strike or not to strike, and under such circumstances, he took the wrong decision.\"\n\nIn a separate development on Monday, the UK Foreign Office summoned Iran's ambassador in London following the detention of his British counterpart in Tehran after he attended a vigil for victims of the Ukrainian plane crash. The CEO of Canadian company Maple Leaf Foods, Michael McCain, meanwhile criticized the US government for escalating tensions in the Middle East in the days before the crash, in which he said a colleague lost his family.",
    " Title: NSA's Middle East and North Africa Group Undergoes Changes in Sigint Collection Capabilities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to streamline its Sigint collection capabilities, the National Security Agency (NSA) made significant adjustments to its Middle East and North Africa group in 2008. The \"ambitious scrub\" of selectors, or search terms, reduced the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795, and the number of messages added to the agency's Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day.\n\nThe reduction in volume was hailed as a major achievement, allowing for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, according to a report. However, the NSA's Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software, with the computer failing to search for email addresses, a fundamental flaw that led to the loss of over 500 messages a week for one target.\n\nThe revelations, stemming from the Snowden disclosures, have sparked debate about the NSA's practices. Joel F. Brenner, the agency's former inspector general, defends the NSA, stating that much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the realpolitik of spying. He believes that the agency is being criticized for doing too well the things it is supposed to do.\n\nHowever, Brenner also acknowledges that technology has outpaced policy at the NSA, and that in an era where spying may be exposed, \"routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.\"\n\nWilliam E. Binney, a former senior NSA official who has become an outspoken critic, expresses less concern about foreign leaders' sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. He warns that without new leadership, new laws, and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of \"turnkey totalitarianism\" \u2013 the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public.\n\nAnother former insider, Bobby R. Inman, who served as NSA director from 1977 to 1981, offers a radical suggestion for the agency. He suggests that the NSA should release everything it believes Edward Snowden has and make it public, a move he believes would be a shock to the agency but could help them move past the controversy and rebuild.",
    " Title: An In-depth Analysis of Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign: Policy Shifts, Controversies, and International Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous political landscape of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has been a figure of controversy and intrigue. His campaign has been marked by policy shifts, contradictions, and a series of contentious statements that have raised concerns among experts and the public alike.\n\nSince the inception of his campaign, NBC News has documented 117 distinct policy shifts on 20 major issues, including three contradictory views on abortion in an eight-hour period. This inconsistency has left reporters struggling to pin down the candidate's positions, a fact that Trump has often exploited at his rallies, mocking the media for their attempts to hold him accountable.\n\nOne of Trump's most notorious campaigns was the \"birther\" movement, which questioned President Obama's legitimacy as a U.S. citizen. However, in a bid to court undecided voters, Trump has flip-flopped on this issue, acknowledging Obama's American birth, while attempting to shift blame to Hillary Clinton for the birther controversy.\n\nTrump's tax-cut plan, initially estimated to cost $10 trillion in tax revenue, has been revised, with one adviser suggesting it could cost $3 trillion. However, there is no clear indication of how this deficit would be addressed, other than promises of favorable treatment for those in the upper tax brackets.\n\nIf elected, Trump's presidency could present significant diplomatic and security challenges. His open doubts about the value of NATO and his repeated denunciations of trade deals and relations with China would strain alliances and potentially destabilize global financial markets. His plan for cutting the national debt, which involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the government owes, has been met with skepticism.\n\nTrump's admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin has also raised concerns. His urging Russia to meddle in the presidential campaign by hacking Clinton's emails has been widely criticized, and his admiration for Putin's dictatorial tactics and suppression of dissent has been a source of controversy.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Trump has expressed a desire to renegotiate the Iran nuclear control agreement and has been criticized for his lack of understanding of the complexities involved. His statements on global warming, which he has dismissed as a \"hoax,\" have also been a point of contention.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's campaign has been marked by promises of change, it remains unclear whether his policies would deliver the desired results. Starting trade wars could lead to economic recession, and a deficit-increasing tax plan would not secure Americans' financial future. Alienating allies and pursuing questionable foreign policies could also compromise national security. As voters head to the polls, these are the questions they should be asking themselves.",
    " Title: Biden and Bloomberg Push for Tougher Gun Control Legislation, Citing Public Support and Reduction in Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of a political impasse regarding the implementation of stricter federal gun control laws, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have not been deterred. On Thursday, they advocated for the enactment of \"common sense legislation to reduce gun violence,\" emphasizing the need for a comprehensive background check system for all gun sales.\n\nThe duo, joined by families of the victims of the December 2012 shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, spoke at New York City Hall, as prospects for a ban on semi-automatic weapons resembling military assault weapons seemed to stall.\n\nBloomberg, citing public opinion polls, stated, \"There's no real debate among Americans about this issue.\" He argued that nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives, and that the only question \"is if Congress has the courage to do the right thing.\"\n\nThe proposed ban, vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association, is expected to receive fewer than 40 votes, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Instead, the ban could be offered as an amendment to the gun legislation on the Senate floor to secure a vote on it, Reid said.\n\nVice President Biden commended Bloomberg's \"immense\" and \"committed\" gun control work and criticized those who argue that the proposals would infringe upon rights. \"Tell me how it violates anyone's constitutional rights to limit (ammunition clips) to 10 rounds,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden also highlighted the positive impact of previous gun control measures, such as the 1994 assault weapons ban and the Brady Bill, which expanded background checks. He emphasized that these reforms, though expired, had a significant, positive impact on public safety.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown was carried out with a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, and Biden argued that such weapons of war have no place on American streets. He expressed his admiration for the Newtown families, stating that their presence has helped move legislation through the Senate Judiciary Committee and given gun control reform a \"fighting chance.\"\n\nBiden also addressed those who argue that assault weapons and high-capacity magazines cannot be banned. He suggested that gun-trafficking legislation would provide police with the power to deal more effectively with straw sales, where individuals purchase multiple guns and then sell them to criminals.\n\nThe proposed reforms, Biden said, \"will not solve every problem. It will not end every gun death. But it will substantially reduce it. And it matters.\"",
    " Title: The Broken Process of Supreme Court Justice Appointments: A Call for Term Limits\n\nArticle:\n\nThe retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, following the contentious and politically charged atmosphere that surrounded the appointment of Justice Antonin Scalia, has highlighted the broken process of selecting Supreme Court justices in the United States. The current system, characterized by a tit-for-tat escalation of norm-breaking and rule-bending, has led to a state where the minority party holds no power over Supreme Court picks, and the majority party can and will install their preferred candidate for life.\n\nIn 2016, the death of Justice Scalia led to the invention of the controversial principle that open seats on the Supreme Court should not be filled during election years. This principle, if consistently applied, would mean that Supreme Court seats would be unfilled half the time, given America's biannual national elections. The ensuing political fury saw Democrats filibustering Neil Gorsuch, a broadly qualified nominee who would have easily passed in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations.\n\nThis back-and-forth, as political scientist Steven Smith terms it, is a manifestation of what he calls \"Senate syndrome\" - a cycle of norm-breaking and rule-breaking that escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. The current state of Supreme Court nominations is a stark example of this syndrome.\n\nIn the current political climate, the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy can be a matter of life and death for various political ideologies. For instance, if Democrats were to win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were to retire in 2019, it would be highly unlikely, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats would allow Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe high stakes of Supreme Court nominations, coupled with the irreversible nature of the position, have led to a politicization of the process that is both undemocratic and random. The unpredictability of when a seat will open, and the length of service of justices, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into a bloodsport.\n\nTo address this issue, a potential solution could be the implementation of term limits for Supreme Court justices. A 10-year, non-renewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination, make the timing of fights more predictable, and discourage justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics. This reform would maintain judicial independence while instilling regularity to the nominations process, discourage justices from outlasting ideologically unfriendly administrations, and prevent the ever-increasing tenure of justices.\n\nImplementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws.",
    " Title: Cory Booker Exits 2020 Presidential Race After Failing to Qualify for December Debate\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Democrat Cory Booker has ended his presidential campaign, leaving a field that was once the most diverse in history with just one remaining African American candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.\n\nThe New Jersey senator, who launched his campaign last February, struggled to raise the necessary funds for a White House bid. He was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in Tuesday's debate. Booker also missed last month's debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Booker said that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising the money required for victory. \"Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win -- money we don't have, and money that is harder to raise because I won't be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington,\" he said.\n\nBooker had warned that the looming impeachment trial of President Donald Trump would deal a \"big, big blow\" to his campaign by pulling him away from Iowa in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. He hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on The \u2588\u2588\u2588' \"Ground Game\" podcast.\n\n\"If we can't raise more money in this final stretch, we won't be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money can do to show presence,\" he said.\n\nIn his email to supporters, Booker pledged to do \"everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president,\" though his campaign says he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary.\n\nBooker, who was once lauded by Oprah Winfrey as the \"rock star mayor\" who helped lead the renewal of Newark, New Jersey, was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery and his early fluency with social media. His rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to President Barack Obama, and he had been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013.\n\nNow, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media. Another former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is seen as the freshest face in the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden has built a strong base of support with black voters. And Booker's message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by Democratic fury over the actions of the Trump administration.\n\nAn early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.\n\nOn the stump, Booker emphasized his Midwestern connections and delivered an exhortation to voters to use \"radical love\" to overcome what he considered Trump's hate. But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.\n\nBooker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He's long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.\n\nHe was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan, and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before. He also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes.\n\nBut he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn't land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.\n\nBooker's seat is up for a vote this year, and he will run for reelection to the Senate. A handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat, but Booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection.\n\nBooker's exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen-strong field, which now stands at 12 candidates.

    " Title: The Evolution of the Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom: A Look at the Shifting Demographics and Partnerships\n\nArticle:\n\nThe annual Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom, a significant motorcycle rally in Washington, D.C., experienced a significant turnout on Sunday, but organizers are concerned about the dwindling numbers of Vietnam veterans, the event's traditional core.\n\nArtie Muller, executive director of Rolling Thunder Inc., the nonprofit foundation that sponsors the freedom ride, expressed his concerns about the future of the organization. \"It's going to be interesting to see what we can really bring to the organization in the next five to ten years,\" he said.\n\nThe Ride for Freedom, which began in 1988 with approximately 2,500 motorcycles and riders, has grown steadily over the years, with 1 million riders and spectators attending the rally this Sunday. However, the growth is primarily due to supporters and family members of the veterans, as younger veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have gravitated towards other organizations.\n\nOne such organization is Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). The wars fought by IAVA members are different from the core Rolling Thunder veterans, and their motorcycles reflect this difference. Harley-Davidson dominates the Rolling Thunder Ride, but younger riders, including those who ride for IAVA, have increasingly been choosing Victory motorcycles.\n\nVictory, a competitor to Harley-Davidson, has pursued a partnership with IAVA. Last year, Victory donated $500 for every bike sold in November and December to IAVA. This year, IAVA riders, on Victory bikes, rode alongside Rolling Thunder for the Memorial Day weekend event.\n\nMatt Colvin, deputy director of strategic corporate and foundation partnerships at IAVA, sees the group as the next generation of riders. \"I have to imagine it would simply be a passing of the torch,\" he said. \"Numbers are dwindling, but I don't think the sentiment will.\"\n\nIAVA has started its own parades, with Victory's help. Last year, more than 700 IAVA veterans and their families marched in the Veterans Day Parade in New York City, where Victory provided about 10 bikes to escort them. More events are planned to showcase the younger group of veterans.\n\nAlthough Harley-Davidson still dominates the road at the Ride for Freedom, Victory's motorcycles and IAVA's veterans add a younger element. Matt Colvin described a camaraderie between Vietnam veterans and younger veterans who may not have been welcomed home from controversial wars in the Middle East with open arms. This shared experience has brought the two groups together.\n\nMr. Colvin, an Air Force veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said he ultimately would like IAVA to integrate with Rolling Thunder. Artie Muller, the executive director of Rolling Thunder, echoed this sentiment and expressed hope that more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans would participate with them.\n\nMr. Colvin stated that IAVA and Rolling Thunder would continue to work together but that it's not quite time for the younger veterans to take over. \"It's definitely not time to hand over the torch. We still have a long way to go before the post-9/11 vets are our main focus here. I do truly believe that there is a next generation that's going to step up and take over,\" he said.",
    " Title: \" The Evolution and Security Concerns of Electronic Voting Machines in the U.S.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of last week's state elections, the focus has shifted from the outcomes to the security of the newly implemented electronic voting machines. These machines, a part of a nationwide push to replace older, paperless voting systems, have been met with both praise for their paper backup feature and concern over their potential vulnerabilities.\n\nCongress approved over $3 billion in 2003 to replace older voting methods with electronic systems, following the disputed 2000 Bush v. Gore election. However, cybersecurity was an afterthought at the time, leading to the current systems that are susceptible to hacking. These systems were targeted by Russia during the 2016 election, and intelligence officials anticipate similar efforts in 2020 by foreign powers like China and Iran.\n\nThe new machines, while providing a paper backup, are not immune to hacking. Although they are not internet-connected, they can be compromised by a skilled hacker in person within minutes. These new machines were used for the first time last week in various districts, with some locations reporting significant glitches.\n\nThe debate over the security of electronic voting machines has led some election security experts to advocate for a return to traditional pen-and-paper ballots. However, this proposal raises concerns about issues such as voter error, confusing ballots, slow counts, and suppressed turnout that were prevalent in earlier elections.\n\nThere is a bipartisan consensus in Congress that more needs to be done to secure the country's voting machines. A bill providing additional funding for election systems has passed both houses, and further funding could be allocated before the 2020 elections. However, a bill requiring all voting systems to have a paper record, passed by House Democrats, has stalled in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe next significant debate in election integrity may center around voting via smartphones, a method that was used by a small number of voters for the first time last Tuesday. While this method could potentially increase voting access, it raises significant security concerns.\n\nExperts warn that hackers are outpacing efforts to secure the electoral process. John Brandon, writing for Fox News, states, \"Criminals and foreign operatives intent on disrupting the midterms have worked harder, faster, and with more intent than those trying to fend off the attacks.\" On the other hand, Jim Geraghty, writing for National Review, argues, \"No hacker in Moscow can reach across the World Wide Web and alter what your ballot says. Even if they somehow managed to alter the data being tabulated in some local or state government system that is connected to the Internet, a recount would reveal the discrepancy.\"\n\nThe potential erosion of public confidence in the election process due to perceived insecurity is a significant concern. As Lee C. Bollinger and Michael A. McRobbie write in The Hill, \"It is sobering to consider the effect that a deep erosion of public confidence in the election process could have. It would be devastating to Americans' faith in our democracy and the legitimacy of our elected government.\"\n\nAs the 2020 elections approach, the debate over the security and integrity of voting systems will undoubtedly continue to be a pressing issue.",
    " Title: Caroline Kennedy Nominated as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, First Woman to Hold Post if Confirmed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Barack Obama has nominated Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Kennedy would become the first woman to hold the post.\n\nKennedy, a prominent Democratic supporter, served as the co-chair of Obama's vice presidential search committee in 2008. The nomination was announced on Wednesday, with CNN reporting that Kennedy had been asked to serve as ambassador and was being vetted for the role since April.\n\nKennedy, the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family, has largely avoided the limelight and scrutiny associated with her famous last name. After expressing interest in running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York vacated when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, she ultimately decided against making a bid, citing personal reasons.\n\nKennedy has made speeches at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions, recalling her famous relatives. In 2008, her speech served as a tribute to her uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy. In 2012, she noted that \"like my father's election in 1960, this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake.\"\n\nAfter receiving degrees at Harvard and Columbia, Kennedy served in a variety of roles at New York non-profits, including the John F. Kennedy Library and the American Ballet Theatre.\n\nThe current U.S. ambassador to Japan is John Roos, who assumed the role in 2009. He was the first American ambassador to attend commemoration ceremonies for the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He also led America's embassy through the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the ensuing nuclear aftermath.\n\nThe United States is Japan's largest economic partner as well as a military ally. The U.S. military presence on Japan's Okinawa Island has remained a point of diplomatic tension between the two nations. Some of the island's residents have complained about noise from the base, in an urban area. Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel.\n\nOpposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay, a decision he called \"heartbreaking.\"\n\nThe confirmation process for Kennedy's nomination will now begin in the U.S. Senate. If confirmed, Kennedy's tenure as ambassador will mark a significant milestone in U.S.-Japan relations.",

The visit comes as the U.S. grapples with the rapid spread of the virus, with more than 1,300 confirmed cases in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nStocks plunged 7% after the opening bell on Thursday, halting trading for 15 minutes due to the fears and fallout over the coronavirus. The visit by Varadkar is one of the few events that is charging ahead amidst the outbreak, with 43 confirmed cases in Ireland as of Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump addressed the travel restrictions he announced Wednesday night, which do not apply to Ireland or the United Kingdom. He explained that it takes a long time to make individual calls to world leaders and claimed that Europe does not alert the U.S. when it raises taxes on the U.S.\n\nThe president's meeting with Varadkar is set to continue on Thursday, with the Irish prime minister attending the annual \"Friends of Ireland\" luncheon hosted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. However, President Trump is skipping this year's event, citing the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last year.\n\nAs the U.S. grapples with the spread of the coronavirus, officials in Washington, D.C., and around the nation have begun to cancel large events. At the White House, public tours have been halted, and in the U.S. Capitol, congressional leaders are nearing a pause on tours. President Trump also canceled upcoming events in Nevada, Colorado, and Wisconsin \"out of an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\nThe White House and Congress are weighing a legislative package to provide economic relief to businesses and people impacted by the virus. President Trump said he wants paid sick leave to be a part of that. The president also emphasized the importance of minimizing the spread of the virus, stating, \"We need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It's going to go away, it's going to go away.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Fourth Defense Chief: Ash Carter's Challenges and Expectations\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama prepares to introduce his fourth defense chief, Ash Carter, the president's own credibility on national security and his relationship with the military are under scrutiny like never before. The White House's role in setting defense policy has been a contentious issue during Obama's tenure, with previous defense secretaries, including Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, criticizing the White House for policy failures and interference.\n\nCarter, a well-regarded policy expert and former deputy defense secretary, is expected to carry out the strategy set by the West Wing and the National Security Council, rather than shift the balance of power back to the Pentagon. His strengths lie in his familiarity with the Pentagon and the military, but he faces the challenge of navigating the White House's currents and developing a strong team at the Pentagon to help him perform at his best.\n\nFormer senior foreign policy officials have noted that Obama is one of the most controlling foreign policy presidents since Richard Nixon, with a tendency to dominate and not delegate. This has led to complaints of undue interference, with the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, acknowledging that there is always some natural tension between the Pentagon and the White House.\n\nThe lack of public confidence in Obama's handling of foreign policy issues, particularly in the fight against ISIL, has been evident in recent months. In September, only 34 percent of Americans approved of the president's foreign policy, according to a CBS/New York Times poll. The delay in announcing Hagel's replacement and the subsequent nomination of Carter has further perpetuated the idea that the White House doesn't have its act together when it comes to the military.\n\nCarter's nomination, however, is widely touted for his policy expertise and experience as deputy defense secretary, though he lacks a strong profile. Many former officials are waiting to see how Carter adjusts to his new position and whether he develops the political skills to handle the White House better than his predecessors.\n\nLawrence Korb, a Reagan administration assistant defense secretary, noted that Carter lacks the leverage over the White House that Gates and even Panetta had. \"He didn't have the gravitas to say, 'Before I take this job, this is what I want, this and this to be assured,'\" said Korb.\n\nDespite these challenges, Carter is not expected to be a pushover. Doug Wilson, assistant secretary of Defense for public affairs under Gates and Panetta, said, \"I do not think the president is looking for a doormat for the next secretary of Defense. I think he's looking for somebody to speak truth to power and to be able to work as a key member of the national security team on the development of policy and the implementation of policy.\"\n\nCarter's success will depend on his ability to build a strong team at the Pentagon and navigate the White House's currents. Ultimately, it is the president's responsibility as commander-in-chief to make the final decision.",
    " Title: High Approval Rate of President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program Raises Questions Ahead of Supreme Court Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe approval rate for President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants temporary amnesty to illegal immigrant Dreamers, has been strikingly high, with 93 percent of all applications decided through December 2019 being approved. This high approval rate is likely to play a significant role next month when the Supreme Court hears a legal challenge to a broader amnesty program.\n\nThe DACA program, which was a test run for a broader amnesty announced by Obama in late 2014, has been held up by lower courts as they sort out whether the administration had the authority to grant temporary stays of deportation, issue work permits, and make illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits.\n\nPresident Obama argues that he is not rewriting the law but offering guidance on how to prioritize enforcement, and that his officers still have discretion in every case to grant or deny amnesty, even if someone meets all the criteria for the program. However, opponents argue that the high approval rate undercuts this argument.\n\nMark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for an immigration crackdown, said, \"It tells me that they're rubber-stamping DACA applications. Any program that four years after its initiation is still approving 93 percent of applicants is a program that doesn't have very high standards.\"\n\nAlthough Dreamers were in little danger of being deported under President Obama's policies, DACA went further. It granted a proactive two-year stay of deportation, issued work permits and Social Security numbers, and made illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits.\n\nThe administration began accepting DACA applications in August 2012, in the middle of President Obama's re-election bid. In 2014, after his party was crushed in midterm congressional elections, President Obama tried to expand the amnesty to three years and making as many as 5 million illegal immigrant parents eligible.\n\nTexas led 25 other states in suing to stop the program, known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). Judges have halted the amnesty for parents while the case winds through courts. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on April 18 and could issue a ruling by the end of June.\n\nWhile DACA is different from DAPA, the two are so closely related that the lower-court judges have used the performance of the Dreamer amnesty to inform their rulings on the broader program for parents. That's why the DACA approval rate has become an issue.\n\nAt the end of last year, nearly 715,000 people had been approved, and fewer than 55,000 had been rejected. That rate is similar to the 94 percent success rate of a farmworker amnesty that was part of the 1986 amnesty. Reports said fraud within that program could have been as high as 50 percent.\n\nNo such widespread fraud charges have been leveled against DACA, and advocates for Dreamers say part of the reason the approval rate is so high is that the immigrants themselves have done a good job of making sure they are eligible before they apply. That means there are fewer borderline cases to be judged, and possibly denied.\n\nAlso, the nearly $500 cost makes immigrants think carefully before applying, said Tom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\"There are a number of very good reasons why you would expect to see an approval rate around where the approval rate is,\" Mr. Jawetz said.\n\nHe said a 7 percent denial is a \"meaningful amount\" that the lower court judges shouldn't have dismissed.\n\nThe 93 percent initial approval rate is lower than at the beginning of the program. Initially, 99.5 percent of applicants were granted DACA status, or what advocates call \"DACAmented\" - a play on the word \"documented.\" Trickier applications took longer to decide, and more of those were denied, part of the reason the approval rate has fallen.\n\nThe program has been around long enough that the initial two-year period has expired for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, who have applied for renewals. The renewal rate is 99.3 percent, according to the latest Homeland Security statistics.\n\nDistrict Judge Andrew S. Hanen and the majority on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the high approval rates suggested that President Obama was writing a new policy. Judge Hanen rejected the president's argument that he was only issuing guidelines to carry out existing law.\n\n\"The key fact - more so than the 92 percent grant rate - is that the government has been unable to identify a single instance where a DACA applicant was denied for discretionary reasons,\" said Josh Blackman, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law who has helped craft briefs supporting Texas' case.\n\nIndeed, Judge Hanen said he asked the government during oral arguments for examples, and except for cases of fraud, the administration couldn't point to any cases in which officers rejected an application that otherwise met the criteria.\n\nImmigrant rights groups are countering that argument in a brief filed with the Supreme Court. They offered a number of cases that they said proved officers were using discretion to reject applications.\n\nIn one case, an immigrant identified by his first name, Christian, 24, had already been ordered deported along with his father, who was accused of being part of crimes in Guatemala's decades-old civil war. The advocates say Christian applied for the amnesty and met all the criteria and was even a hardship case because he was the sole provider for his daughter and her mother, yet he was denied without further explanation.\n\nIn another case, a Virginia man named Francisco, who arrived from Mexico when he was 10, was denied DACA benefits. The immigrant rights advocates said he is married to a U.S. citizen, has a 6-year-old child who is a citizen, and had a minor criminal record that shouldn't have disqualified him - yet he, too, was denied.\n\nLawyers also raised the case of Gabriela, a 31-year-old who had been approved for the amnesty in June 2014 but had it revoked a year and a half later.\n\n\"The argument that the government lacks discretion to deny deferred action, or to revoke it at any time once granted, is simply wrong,\" the attorneys for the immigrant rights groups said in their brief to the high court.",
    " Title: Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Upholds $135,000 Damages Order Against Sweet Cakes by Melissa\n\nArticle:\n\nThe owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, a bakery in Oregon, have been ordered to pay $135,000 in damages for emotional suffering to a same-sex couple following a final ruling by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) on Thursday. The ruling affirms an initial decision made in January, which found Aaron and Melissa Klein, the bakery's owners, in violation of Oregon civil-rights law for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony in 2013.\n\nOregon labor commissioner Brad Avakian, in his 122-page order, stated, \"This case is not about a wedding cake or a marriage. It is about a business's refusal to serve someone because of their sexual orientation, which is illegal under Oregon law.\"\n\nThe Kleins had argued that their religious beliefs prevented them from participating in the wedding by baking the cake. However, Mr. Avakian rejected this distinction, stating, \"The forum has already found there to be no distinction between discriminating against a same-sex couple and refusing to participate in a same-sex ceremony.\"\n\nThe Kleins' attorney, Anna Harmon, described the final order as a \"shocking result which shows the state's relentless campaign to punish Oregonians who live and work according to their faith,\" according to KATU-TV in Portland. The Kleins, who have since closed their shop and now sell baked goods from their home, indicated in a Facebook post that they \"will NOT give up this fight,\" suggesting they may appeal the order to the Oregon Court of Appeals.\n\nIn their Facebook post, the Kleins stated, \"According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. We stand for God's truth, God's word, and freedom for ALL Americans. We are here to obey God, not man, and we will not conform to this world.\"\n\nThe Sweet Cakes case is one of at least a half-dozen involving complaints by same-sex couples against Christian small business owners who declined to provide products for gay weddings.",
    " Title: Sanders' Resolute Attitude: A Shift in Strategy Amidst Democratic Primary Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent, has displayed a newfound determination in his presidential campaign, a development that stems from months of frustration with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over perceived favoritism towards Hillary Clinton, his primary rival.\n\nThis resurgence in Sanders' campaign strategy is also a response to issues such as the debate schedule, fund-raising arrangements, and the appointment of Clinton partisans as leaders of key convention committees. The DNC's rebuke of Sanders on Tuesday, for not explicitly condemning a violent incident at the Nevada Democratic convention, has further fueled Sanders' campaign's resolve.\n\nWhile Sanders has expressed his desire for Donald Trump not to win in November, his advisers and allies suggest that he is prepared to cause some damage to Clinton in the short term if it means securing a majority of the 475 pledged delegates in California. This strategy would allow Sanders to arrive at the Philadelphia convention with significant political clout.\n\nTad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders, stated that the campaign does not believe their attacks will benefit Trump in the long run. However, Devine added that Sanders' team is \"not thinking about\" the possibility of their actions potentially derailing Clinton from becoming the first woman elected president.\n\nDevine emphasized, \"The only thing that matters is what happens between now and June 14,\" referring to the final Democratic primary in the District of Columbia. \"We have to put the blinders on and focus on the best case to make in the upcoming states. If we do that, we can be in a strong position to make the best closing argument before the convention. If not, everyone will know in mid-June, and we'll have to take a hard look at where things stand.\"\n\nThe prospect of a prolonged Democratic primary battle is causing concern among party leaders who are eager for Clinton and other House and Senate candidates to focus on attacking Trump, rather than being sidetracked by internal Democratic strife. Sanders has garnered nearly 10 million votes, compared to Clinton's 13 million, and Democratic leaders argue that Clinton needs time to court young voters, liberals, and Sanders supporters who view her as aligned with corporate and big-money interests.",
    " Title: The Millennial Generation: A Political Puzzle in the 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, an unusual silence pervades social media regarding potential candidates, with the millennial generation, known for their vocal opinions, seemingly lacking a clear preference. As President Barack Obama, a charismatic figure among millennials, prepares to leave office, the political alliances of this generation are up for grabs.\n\nFor the past seven years, millennials have been steadfast in their support of marriage equality, a cause that aligns with the Democrat Party's platform. However, with the legalization of gay marriage in every state, many millennials find themselves apathetic towards the political landscape without a direct loyalty to the Democrat Party.\n\nMillennials' political views are diverse, as a recent Reason Foundation poll reveals. They desire small government, provided budget cuts do not impact them directly. They have higher approval ratings for Congress than any other generation, yet they oppose Obamacare, a policy they once supported. They want the government to address their problems, but they do not want Washington in charge.\n\nThe lack of a clear political leaning among millennials has left both major parties puzzled. Neither party has found a candidate they believe they can successfully sell to this generation. The solution, it seems, lies in starting a conversation. Millennials want to be part of something, from gay marriage to global events like the World Cup.\n\nInterestingly, it is the Republican Party, when stripped to its core, that resonates with millennials' desire for limited government. While the past eight years have seen a push for taxing the wealthy and redistributing wealth, millennials, contrary to this narrative, prefer to keep their wealth and use it as they see fit.\n\nThe political affiliations of the millennial generation are up for grabs. If the Republican Party can learn how to create a conversation centered around limited government, 2016's political landscape may quickly become more red than anticipated. The millennial generation desires freedom, not government control, in their personal lives and finances. This generation wants to pursue their passions, start their own companies, and enjoy life without Washington dictating their choices. The political landscape is evolving, and the millennial generation may hold the key to the future.",
    " Title: Analysis: Hillary Clinton's Struggles in the Democratic Race and the Concerns for the General Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary race, Hillary Clinton is currently leading her opponent, Bernie Sanders, but is facing criticism from some pundits and commentators. Despite President Obama's endorsement and her consistent wins in state primaries, Clinton is receiving negative reviews from some quarters, raising concerns about her performance in the general election against a potential Republican candidate, such as Donald Trump.\n\nThe conventional wisdom had previously suggested that a Trump nomination would all but assure a second Clinton presidency. However, some commentators are now questioning Clinton's ability to withstand a Trump onslaught, citing her high negatives and perceived lack of charisma.\n\nJoe Klein, a longtime Clinton observer, has offered a critical assessment of Clinton's potential matchup with Trump. Klein, who has written sympathetically about the Clintons for over two decades, argues that Clinton is \"our very own quinoa and kale salad, nutritious but bland.\" He also suggests that Clinton's political style and speaking style may not be well-suited for the current political climate, as she is often perceived as too much of a politician and too much of an embodiment of the establishment that Trump has been running against.\n\nClinton's low polling marks on honesty, a result of the email scandal and decades of accumulated accusations, are also seen as a significant problem. Veteran journalist Jeff Greenfield, writing in Politico, spells out three reasons why Clinton could prove to be a weak candidate: mistrust, association with the establishment, and the perception of embodying the past rather than the future.\n\nClinton's struggles to engage younger voters, who are turning away from her in favor of Sanders, are also a concern. When Clinton recalibrates, Greenfield notes, she often embraces the politically popular stand.\n\nDespite the Democratic base's lukewarm support for Clinton, she enjoys broad support within the party, and most Bernie backers should have no trouble shifting their allegiance to her. The same cannot be said for Trump, who is currently weathering a Republican revolt against his likelihood of winning the nomination.\n\nThe key for Clinton will be to address the concerns of the left and to start receiving better reviews from journalists on the left. It remains to be seen whether she will be able to do so and whether she can overcome the challenges posed by a potential Trump candidacy in the general election.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson Meets with Russian Counterpart Amid Syria Tensions; White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer Under Fire for Holocaust Comparison\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense political climate, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is currently in Moscow, meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the war in Syria. The meeting comes after White House officials accused Russia of attempting to conceal the Syrian government's alleged role in a chemical attack that killed 86 civilians, including dozens of children, last week.\n\nThe U.S. asserts that the Syrian government carried out the attack, while Russia has blamed the anti-government rebels for the incident. The Russian foreign minister has criticized the U.S.'s rhetoric, labeling it as \"primitive and loutish.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signaled a potential meeting with Tillerson during the secretary of state's trip, marking a shift from Putin's earlier position.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers and Jewish organizations, including the Anne Frank Center, are demanding the resignation of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer following his controversial comments regarding the Syrian conflict and the Holocaust.\n\nDuring a press briefing, Spicer compared the Syrian regime to Hitler and falsely claimed that Hitler never used chemical weapons. In fact, the Nazis systematically used poison gas as part of their genocide of 6 million Jews and others. The Nazis began experimenting with gas with the specific purpose of carrying out mass murder in the late 1930s. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, they deployed gas vans to kill hundreds of thousands of people. By 1942, the Nazis had set up a series of concentration camps where gas chambers were the main method of killing people. At its peak, as many as 6,000 people, mostly Jews, were gassed to death every day at Auschwitz concentration camp alone.\n\nSpicer also referred to Nazi concentration camps as \"holocaust centers\" during his comments.\n\nHours later, Spicer issued an apology, acknowledging his inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust. However, he made several mistakes during his apology, including mispronouncing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's name.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Spicer clarified his statement, stating that he meant to say President Trump was seeking to stabilize the region, not to destabilize it.",
    " Title: Unexpected Success: The Real Shock of Obamacare Reform Unveiled\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, goes into full effect from next year, predictions of administrative chaos and consumer shock are circulating widely. The law is expected to face significant challenges, with the potential for a political advantage for the Republicans due to the law's perceived difficulties. However, new evidence, particularly from California, the law's most significant test case, indicates that the real Obamacare shock may be one of unexpected success.\n\nIt is essential to clarify a crucial point: Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform, not in a political sense (although it was originally a Republican proposal), but in terms of leaving most people's health care unaffected. Americans who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicare, or Medicaid\u2014which is to say, the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all\u2014will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect.\n\nHowever, there are millions of Americans who do not receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs. They can obtain insurance only by buying it on their own, and many of them are effectively shut out of that market. In some states, like California, insurers reject applicants with past medical problems. In others, like New York, insurers cannot reject applicants and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history (community rating). Unfortunately, this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up, while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act aims to address this issue by creating health insurance marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance. The law also provides subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals to make insurance more affordable. The success of these reforms in states like California could lead to a significant reduction in the number of uninsured Americans and a more stable insurance market.\n\nIn conclusion, while there will undoubtedly be challenges as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect, the evidence suggests that the real shock may be one of unexpected success, particularly in states like California. The law's conservative approach to leaving most people's health care unaffected, combined with the creation of health insurance marketplaces and subsidies, could lead to a significant reduction in the number of uninsured Americans and a more stable insurance market.",
    " Title: President Trump Removes State Department Inspector General, Sparking Controversy and Allegations of Retaliation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and allegations of retaliation, President Donald Trump fired the State Department's Inspector General, Steve Linick, on Friday night. The president's letter to Congress, which did not mention Linick by name, stated that his removal would take effect in 30 days.\n\nLinick, who has held the Inspector General position since 2013, had overseen reports that were critical of the State Department's management policies since Trump took office. His office had also criticized several Trump appointees for their treatment of career staff, allegedly for being insufficiently supportive of the president and his policies.\n\nLast October, it was reported that Linick had hosted a closed-door briefing on Ukraine for aides from several congressional committees. The briefing examined communications between Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin and current Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko. Linick also shared news clips and information regarding Ukrainian energy company Burisma, whose board members included Hunter Biden, son of the former vice president.\n\nThe conversations between Giuliani and the Ukrainians were in reference to reports that former Vice President Joe Biden had sought to have Shokin fired amid an investigation into Burisma. President Trump's July 2019 request that Ukraine's president investigate the Biden matter led to the House impeaching the president last December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted Trump in February.\n\nDemocrats in Congress immediately cried foul, with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that Linick was fired in part in retaliation for opening an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \"This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,\" Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick\u2019s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.\"\n\nEngel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, although two congressional aides told the Associated Press the investigation involved allegations that Pompeo may have improperly treated staff.\n\nLinick's removal continues a series of changes among the government's inspectors general. In April, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's impeachment. Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the Defense Department, a move that stripped him of his post as chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. That panel is charged with overseeing the allocation of more than $2 trillion in coronavirus relief funding.\n\nDuring a White House briefing on the coronavirus, Trump questioned the independence of an inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services over a report that said there was a shortage of supplies and testing at hospitals.\n\nWhen Linick departs, he will be replaced by Stephen Akard, a former career foreign service officer with close ties to Vice President Mike Pence. Akard currently runs the department's Office of Foreign Missions. He had been nominated to be the director general of the Foreign Service but withdrew after objections he was not experienced enough.\n\n\"The president must cease his pattern of reprisal and retaliation against the public servants who are working to keep Americans safe, particularly during this time of global emergency,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. Pelosi claimed Linick was being \"punished for honorably performing his duty to protect the Constitution and our national security.\"\n\nThe developments come as the Trump administration faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its response to allegations of mismanagement and corruption. The firing of Linick, who was widely respected for his integrity and independence, has raised concerns about the administration's commitment to accountability and transparency.",

During a news conference, Becerra stated, \"State law is state law. It's my job to enforce state law, and I will do so. We want to make sure that every jurisdiction, including Orange County, understands what state law requires of the people and the subdivisions of the state of California.\"\n\nWhen asked if this stance meant potential arrests or lawsuits against a sheriff who announced her department would cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement by publishing inmate release dates through an online database called \"Who's in Jail,\" Becerra did not provide a specific response.\n\nThe Orange County Sheriff's Department, in a statement on Tuesday, defended its decision, stating, \"Our decision will enhance communication between the Sheriff's Department and our law enforcement partners to remove dangerous offenders from our community.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchins expressed surprise at the attorney general's statement, stating, \"You are the chief law enforcement officer of the county. The attorney general is threatening to arrest you.\" Carlson responded, \"I have never heard of anything like that happening in any state.\" Hutchins countered, \"I don't think he understands what the law says. What I'm doing is entirely within the confines of the law, and I'm doing what I think is important for my constituents. It's a public safety issue to me. It's not about immigration at all. It's about individuals who have committed violent crimes.\"\n\nFollowing the Sheriff Department's statement, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted 3-0 to join the Department of Justice's lawsuit against California over three of the state's recent immigration laws. Supervisor Shawn Nelson stated ahead of the vote, \"This legislation prevents law enforcement from removing criminals from our community and is a threat to public safety.\"",
    " Title: FBI Obtains FISA Warrant to Monitor Carter Page, Trump Campaign Advisor, in 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nLast summer, the FBI obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump. This development, leaked to The Washington Post last night, does not necessarily imply that Page was involved in any wrongdoing, but it does indicate that the Bureau had enough evidence to suspect that Page was in contact with Russian agents, leading to the order to place him under surveillance.\n\nAccording to law enforcement and U.S. officials, the FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page's communications after presenting sufficient evidence to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case, Russia. This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents.\n\nThe counterintelligence investigation into Russian efforts to influence U.S. elections began in July, officials have said. Page has not been accused of any crimes, and it is unclear whether the Justice Department might later seek charges against him or others in connection with Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe FBI, White House, and the Justice Department declined to comment on the matter. Typically, when an American is caught through incidental collection through these FISA warrants, minimization protocols are initiated to protect this person's privacy. However, the Obama White House reportedly tweaked the protocols when it came to unmasking individuals, which could potentially lead to political espionage.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, first unveiled the news of the unmasking in a short press conference last month. The move was seen as controversial, with members of the committee crying foul that they were not shown the documents that Nunes said revealed this information. Nunes also viewed these documents on White House grounds, where two staffers aided in a navigational capacity since intelligence services were reportedly stonewalling Nunes.\n\nFox News' Adam Housley and Malia Zimmerman were the ones that broke the news that the person who requested the unmasking was high up the food chain in the intelligence community, not a member of the FBI, and well known. That person was Susan Rice, who said last month on PBS that she had no clue about the leaks. Now, she says that unmasking was part of the job; she changed her story. Rice isn't exactly an arbiter of truth either. She lied about the nature of the 2012 Benghazi attack, which she said was due to a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video when in fact\u2014the administration knew that this was a coordinated terrorist attack by a group affiliated with al-Qaeda.\n\nBoth GOP and Democratic House Intelligence committee members have looked at the documents that Nunes and ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) looked at and concluded that there doesn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary (or illegal)\u2014even with Rice's unmasking request. However, both the House and Senate probes seem to be set on calling Ms. Rice in for further questioning.\n\nAs of right now, there is no definitive proof that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, according to Rep. Adam Schiff himself last week. FISA warrants are almost never turned down, so it's apparent that the threshold is rather low. What is absolutely true as of right now is that there is no definitive proof that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.",
    " Title: U.S. Embassy Compound in Tripoli Reportedly Taken Over by Islamic Militia\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Islamic militant group, the Dawn of Libya, has reportedly taken control of the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli, Libya's capital city. The American personnel evacuated the area approximately a month ago due to ongoing fighting in the country.\n\nOn Sunday, an Associated Press journalist was granted access to the compound by the Dawn of Libya, who invited onlookers inside. The compound showed signs of vandalism, with broken windows, but most of the equipment appeared untouched.\n\nThe takeover of the U.S. diplomatic post is likely to reignite debate in the U.S. regarding its role in Libya, more than three years after it supported rebels who overthrew dictator Moammar Gadhafi. A senior State Department official stated, \"We are seeking additional details. At this point, we believe the Embassy compound itself remains secure, but we continue to monitor the situation on the ground, which remains very fluid.\"\n\nThe Dawn of Libya commander claimed that his forces had been in control of the compound since last week. The official continued, \"We continue to work with the Government of Libya and other parties on issues of concern. Our Ambassador and other officials remain engaged both in Washington and from our Embassy in Valetta, Malta, where Embassy staff from Tripoli were recently relocated.\"\n\nNo U.S. military or assets were guarding the property after the State Department withdrew. The last significant incident at a U.S. facility in Libya was the 2012 terror attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, which resulted in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, and State Department information management officer Sean Smith.\n\nA video posted online showed men playing in a pool at the compound. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones stated that the video appeared to have been shot in the embassy's residential annex. However, two sources with first-hand knowledge of the embassy and other U.S. facilities in Libya claim that the YouTube video, in which militia members are diving from a roof into a pool, was taken at the CIA annex in Tripoli that was abandoned when U.S. Embassy personnel and the ambassador evacuated on July 26. It is about a mile away from the U.S. Embassy in Libya.\n\nWhen the CIA abandoned the annex in July, it would no longer be considered sovereign U.S. territory. Ambassador Jones also stated that the compound appears to be \"safeguarded,\" not \"ransacked.\"\n\nThe fighting prompted diplomats and thousands of Tripoli residents to flee. Dozens were killed in the fighting. On July 26, U.S. diplomats evacuated to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort. The State Department announced that embassy operations would be suspended until the security situation improved. The Dawn of Libya militia has since called on foreign diplomats to return now that the fighting has subsided.",
    " Title: High School Student Speaks Out, Denies Allegations of Racial Taunting in Viral Rally Confrontation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released Sunday evening, Nick Sandmann, a junior at Covington Catholic High School, addressed the viral video showing a confrontation between Native American protesters and his classmates during a Washington rally. Sandmann claimed that his classmates were taunted by a group of African-American protesters before the incident, and that he and his family have received death threats.\n\nSandmann stated, \"I am mortified that so many people have come to believe something that did not happen -- that students from my school were chanting or acting in a racist fashion toward African Americans or Native Americans. I did not do that, do not have hateful feelings in my heart, and did not witness any of my classmates doing that.\"\n\nThe initial accusations were made after a snippet of video from the apparent confrontation gained traction on social media, with many condemning the students, some of whom were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" apparel. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington and the high school issued a joint statement apologizing to Nathan Phillips, the Native American activist involved in the incident, on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the emergence of longer video that appears to show some students being harassed by a group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites prompted some conservatives to retract their earlier criticisms of the students.\n\nAccording to Sandmann, his classmates had taken part in the March for Life and had arrived at the Lincoln Memorial to wait for the buses that would take them back to Kentucky. However, they were confronted by four members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, who allegedly used racial slurs and made threats.\n\nSandmann said one of the students asked a teacher chaperoning the trip for permission to \"begin our school spirit chants\" to drown out the hecklers. In one chant, the group appeared to perform the haka, a traditional Maori dance. Marcus Frejo, a member of the Pawnee and Seminole tribes who witnessed the chant, considered it mockery.\n\n\"At no time did I hear any student chant anything other than the school spirit chants,\" Sandmann said. \"I did not witness or hear any other students chant 'build that wall' or anything hateful or racist at any time. Assertions to the contrary are simply false.\"\n\nAt that point, Phillips approached the group with his drum, according to Sandmann, who said Phillips \"locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face\" and \"played his drum the entire time he was in my face.\" Sandmann said he remained motionless and calm to defuse the tense situation.\n\nPhillips, in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, said he was trying to keep the peace between the students and the group that was heckling them. He also insisted that the students were making disparaging remarks about Native Americans.\n\nSandmann concluded his statement by saying, \"One person threatened to harm me at school and one person claims to live in my neighborhood. My parents are receiving death and professional threats because of the social media mob that has formed over this issue.\"",
    " Title: The Collapse of the American Health Care Act: A Failure of Policy and Political Imagination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Health Care Act, a key legislative priority for the Republican Party, has failed to pass in the House of Representatives. The bill, which was widely criticized for its potential to leave 24 million people without insurance and raise deductibles for millions more, was opposed not just by Democrats but also by many Republicans.\n\nThe failure of the AHCA is a significant blow to Speaker Paul Ryan, who took charge of the legislative process and was expected to produce legislation that could pass. The bill's shortcomings were highlighted by conservative groups such as the Heritage Action and Republican representatives like Rep. Mo Brooks, who described it as \"bad policy\" and a \"disaster.\"\n\nThe AHCA's failure reflects a deeper failure of moral and policy imagination, as the Republican Party, which had promised to repair its relationship with the poor and improve healthcare, produced a bill that was widely criticized as inadequate. The bill's collapse is a stark reminder of the challenges of governing and the need for patience, compromise, and a willingness to engage in the slow, arduous work of crafting policy that can pass.\n\nThe limits of President Donald Trump's attention span were on display throughout the AHCA's short life, with the president failing to learn enough about the bill to make a persuasive case for it. Trump's strategy of blaming Democrats for the bill's failure and threatening to sabotage Obamacare to gain negotiating leverage is dangerous and unlikely to be effective.\n\nThe Republican Party would be wise to reflect deeply on what happened and learn from this defeat. As Jonathan Chait writes, the party has spent eight years building a news bubble that exaggerates the law's shortcomings and ignores its successes. Their attacks on Obamacare have been opportunistic and cynical, making the replacement of the law nearly impossible.\n\nBig policy change is hard, and the modern Republican Party has forgotten how to do the slow, arduous work of governing. The party needs to learn from this defeat, or they are doomed to repeat it, and repeat it, and repeat it.",
    " Title: Tragic Discovery of 39 Bodies in Truck Container in England Sparks Murder Investigation\n\nGRAYS, England (AP) \u2014 In a grim discovery, 39 people were found dead in a truck container in an industrial park in England on Wednesday, leading to the arrest of the truck's driver on suspicion of murder in one of Britain's worst human-smuggling tragedies.\n\nThe truck and the trailer with the people inside apparently took separate circuitous journeys before ending up on the grounds of the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of London on the River Thames.\n\nAuthorities are reconstructing the final journey of the victims as they try to piece together where they were from and how they came to be in England. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of Parliament who represents the area where the truck was found, said, \"To put 39 people into a locked metal container shows a contempt for human life that is evil.\"\n\nThe truck's driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, was arrested on suspicion of murder. He has not been charged and his name has not been released.\n\nThe truck was registered in Bulgaria to a company owned by an Irish citizen, according to Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry. The Belgian federal prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the case.\n\nAs darkness approached Wednesday, a police motorcycle escort slowly led the Scania semitrailer out of the industrial park, taking it to a place where the bodies could be recovered. The driver of the trailer wore a full forensic suit and gloves as he guided the massive vehicle in the impromptu cortege past journalists.\n\nBritain remains an attractive destination for immigrants, even as the U.K. is negotiating its divorce from the European Union. In Parliament, Prime Minister Boris Johnson put aside the Brexit crisis and vowed that human traffickers would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n\nAmbulance workers discovered the bodies after being called at 1:40 a.m. It was unclear who called the ambulance service. No cause of death has been made public, and police have not released further details about the victims.\n\nThe tragedy recalls similar incidents in the past, such as the death of 58 migrants in 2000 in a truck in Dover, England, and the deaths in 2015 of 71 migrants from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan who were found suffocated in the back of a refrigerated truck that was abandoned on an Austrian highway close to the Hungarian border.\n\nGroups of migrants have repeatedly landed on English shores using small boats for the risky Channel crossing, and migrants are sometimes found in the trunks of cars that disembark from the massive ferries that link France and England. Wednesday's macabre find in an industrial park was a reminder that trafficking gangs are still profiting from the human trade. Police are also investigating a separate incident in which nine people were found traveling in the back of a truck in southeast England.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said its specialists are working to \"urgently identify and take action against any organized crime groups who have played a role in causing these deaths.\" It said in May that the number of people being smuggled into Britain via cargo trucks was on the rise.\n\nVeselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, Raf Casert in Brussels, and Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary, contributed to this story.",
    " Title: Jersey City Shooting Highlights Challenges in Combating Gun Trafficking Across State Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nTRENTON, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The fatal attack on a Jewish market in New Jersey has brought renewed attention to the issue of gun trafficking across state lines, as officials from states with strong gun restrictions call for stricter firearm control in places with weaker laws.\n\nThree civilians and a police officer were gunned down Tuesday by two killers with anti-Semitic and anti-law enforcement beliefs, according to the state's attorney general. The attackers carried five firearms and a pipe bomb in the U-Haul van they drove to the Jersey City Jewish market before opening fire, officials said. Two of the weapons used by David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, were bought by Graham in Ohio last year, police said. It's unknown where they got the three other guns.\n\nNew Jersey is among the states with the toughest gun restrictions in the country, and in the past two years, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has signed over a half-dozen new restrictions into law, including a lower bullet limit for gun magazines and a red flag law. He's also made a priority of highlighting the so-called iron pipeline of firearms from other states, particularly along the Interstate 95 corridor.\n\nMurphy says it's important to \"name and shame\" states with weaker gun laws that effectively import weapons into New Jersey. And in California, its Democratic governor and attorney general this year both criticized the continued ability to bring in illegal firearms from other states despite California's strict gun laws.\n\nFor years, Chicago officials have complained that street violence often comes from the muzzles of guns sold in states with less-stringent laws. Officials there and elsewhere have renewed demands for gun control at the federal level.\n\n\"It keeps happening, over and over and over again, on their damn watch,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said of federal politicians. \"I can't put borders up in a neighboring state where you can buy this damn stuff legally.\"\n\nFederal legislation is the missing factor, agreed Murphy's top gun adviser.\n\n\"If we're being honest, New Jersey is not an oasis and that's why it's extraordinarily frustrating,\" said Bill Castner. \"We will continue to push and identify the most aggressive actions, but without a federal solution, it's extraordinarily challenging.\"\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group is pressing ahead with state-level gun control because of the political headwinds in Washington.\n\n\"What we have to do until we have the right president and Congress is go state by state,\" Watts said in an interview. \"That's what we have to do now because of the political makeup. Every state is only as safe as the closest state with the weakest gun laws.\"\n\nSecond Amendment advocates, though, push back on the need for tougher state and national laws. Scott Bach, the executive director of the New Jersey Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs, an affiliate of the NRA, invoked a common criticism of tougher restrictions: criminals break laws, they don't follow them.\n\n\"Criminals laugh at gun regulations \u2014 the only thing they understand is severe punishment for actual gun crime,\" Bach said.\n\nOfficials are still investigating the Jersey City attack and have yet to release details about how the deceased attackers obtained their weapons.",
    " Title: U.S. Successfully Tests Ballistic Missile Defense System as North Korea Vows More Missile Tests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Missile Defense Agency (MDA) announced on Wednesday that a U.S. warship had successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii. The test, which involved the USS John Paul Jones, marked the second successful interception of a medium-range ballistic missile using the SM-6 missile system.\n\nThe USS John Paul Jones detected and tracked the missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai with its onboard radar before intercepting it with SM-6 missiles, according to the MDA. The test, which took place on Wednesday, is a significant milestone for the MDA, as it continues to develop ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the evolving threat.\n\nThe test comes as North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, has vowed to continue conducting more missile tests in the Pacific. On Wednesday, North Korea released images of its intermediate-range ballistic missile launch over Japan the previous day. The official Korean Central News Agency reported that the Hwasong-12, the first missile the nation has fired over Japan, was \"guided\" by Kim Jong Un and observed by senior officials.\n\nThe launch of the intermediate-range rocket traveled nearly 1,700 miles and reached a maximum height of 341 miles as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido early Tuesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, described the test as an \"unprecedented, grave threat.\"\n\nIn response to North Korea's latest missile launch, President Trump warned that \"all options are on the table.\" However, military action seems unlikely, according to security analysts. The United Nations Security Council \"strongly condemned\" the missile test and demanded that North Korea \"immediately cease all such actions.\"\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea are also set to discuss possible responses to North Korea's provocative actions, as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet with South Korea's Defense Minister Song Young-moo at the Pentagon on Wednesday. The two will discuss the ongoing military drills and the North's latest actions.\n\nChina, North Korea's most important ally, has also called for the U.S. to \"correct its mistake\" over North Korea sanctions. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will \"fully and completely\" abide by U.N. Security Council sanctions and work with other council members on how best to react to the North's latest action.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May also called on China to put more pressure on North Korea during her three-day visit to Japan on Wednesday. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on 10 companies and six individuals from mostly China and Russia who it says helped North Korea develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
    " Title: Explosion in Afghanistan's Khost Province Leaves Three Dead, 11 Injured; Taliban-US Agreement Tensions Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nA tragic incident occurred in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province on Monday, resulting in at least three fatalities and 11 injuries following an explosion during a football match. According to Sayed Ahmad Babazai, the police chief in the area, the explosion was caused by a motorcycle rigged with a bomb.\n\nThe bomb detonated near a football pitch in Nadir Shah Kot district in the afternoon, as confirmed by Talib Khan Mangal, the provincial governor's spokesman. This incident follows the Taliban's announcement of resuming offensive operations against Afghan security forces, marking a halt in the \"reduction in violence\" agreement that preceded the signing of a deal between the Taliban and the United States.\n\nUnder the four-part agreement signed on Saturday, foreign forces will withdraw from Afghanistan within 14 months, contingent upon Taliban security guarantees and the group's commitment to hold talks with the Kabul government. The agreement sets March 10 as the date for an intra-Afghan dialogue, as well as a prisoner-swap, with the Afghan government releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban releasing 1,000 captives.\n\nHowever, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani stated on Sunday that the government has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners. In response, the Taliban announced on Monday that they would not participate in intra-Afghan talks until the prisoners were released. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters news agency, \"We are fully ready for the intra-Afghan talks, but we are waiting for the release of our 5,000 prisoners.\"\n\nCommander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, US General Scott Miller, expressed expectations for the Taliban to adhere to their obligations. \"The reduction in violence was a confidence builder... The United States has been very clear about our expectations - the violence must remain low,\" Miller said in a tweet.",
    " Title: U.S. Special Forces Member Criticizes Turkey's Actions in Northeastern Syria, Expresses Concern Over ISIS Prisoners\n\nA U.S. special forces member serving with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria has criticized Turkey's actions in northeastern Syria, stating that Turkey is inflicting atrocities as it invades the region. The unidentified soldier, who has been involved in the training of indigenous forces on multiple continents, told Fox News that Turkey is not adhering to the agreements made and that the Kurds have not posed a threat to Turkey.\n\nThe soldier's comments come after President Trump announced that U.S. troops would withdraw from the area in anticipation of Turkey's offensive, removing the chief deterrent to Ankara's operation. The decision has sparked a firestorm in Washington, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) calling it a \"disaster in the making\" that could lead to an ISIS comeback.\n\nTurkey has long viewed Kurdish groups in northern Syria, which have worked with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS, as linked with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a terrorist organization labeled as such by both Washington and Ankara. Reports have emerged of several civilian casualties since Turkey's military operation began, with the U.S. soldier telling Fox News that the U.S. troops are merely \"sitting by and watching it unfold.\"\n\nDefense officials have expressed concerns that the offensive against the SDF could lead to the inadvertent release of several ISIS members that the SDF is detaining. Trump confirmed Thursday morning that the U.S. had taken custody of two ISIS militants believed to be part of an execution unit in case the Kurds or Turkey \"lose control.\" The U.S. has already taken the two ISIS militants, known as the Beetles, out of Syria and into a secure location controlled by the U.S.\n\nThe soldier expressed concern that many of the ISIS prisoners \"will be free in the coming days and weeks.\" The soldier's comments highlight the potential consequences of the U.S. withdrawal from the region and the ongoing concerns about the stability and security of northeastern Syria.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Takes to Twitter for a \"Festivus\" Airing of Grievances\n\nIn a nod to the popular sitcom \"Seinfeld,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) celebrated the unofficial holiday \"Festivus\" on Monday by airing his grievances with Washington on Twitter. The holiday, popularized in a 1997 episode of the show, is traditionally observed on December 23.\n\nPaul, known for his libertarian leanings, used the platform to express his discontent with various aspects of politics in Washington, D.C. His tweets ranged from criticizing the Federal Reserve and the recently passed bipartisan budget, to more lighthearted complaints such as the food in the Senate cafeteria and the D.C. street cleaning schedule.\n\nOne of Paul's tweets read, \"In Washington, 'bipartisan deal' is a synonym for 'increasing our debt.'\" He also expressed his displeasure with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) for not retweeting him enough, to which Booker responded, \"U, me & 'feats of strength': Senate floor, name the time.\"\n\nPaul also called for more debate and amendments in the Senate, and lamented the lack of burgoo, a traditional Kentucky dish, in the Senate cafeteria. He also shared a minor grievance about forgetting when to move his car for D.C. street cleaning.\n\nIn addition to these, Paul took aim at the Federal Reserve, stating that its policies make people poorer and hurt the poor and middle class the most. He argued that these policies increase the costs of goods, and that the public should thank the Fed for their rising grocery and gas bills.\n\n\"Seinfeld\" writer Dan O'Keefe weighed in on Paul's reference the next day. The holiday, which includes the \"airing of grievances\" and the \"feats of strength,\" has become a cultural touchstone and is often celebrated by fans of the show.",
    " Title: House Ways and Means Committee Issues Subpoenas for President Trump's Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move to escalate the ongoing dispute over President Donald Trump's tax returns, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal has issued subpoenas to Department of the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig, demanding six years of the president's tax returns.\n\nThe Treasury Department had previously declined Neal's initial request for the president's tax returns. In a statement, Neal expressed hope that the Treasury Department would comply with the subpoena and provide the requested material within a week, allowing the committee to promptly begin its work.\n\nOn Monday, Mnuchin rejected Neal's request in a letter, citing the advice of the Department of Justice and asserting that the committee's request lacked a legitimate legislative purpose. The original request, made in April, was for Trump's 2013-2018 tax returns, which were sought under a law allowing select members of Congress to review individual tax returns for legislative purposes.\n\nThis demand for a sitting president's tax information marks the first such request in 45 years. In addition to the president's tax returns, Neal also demanded copies of tax returns for Trump's trust and his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThe subpoena is part of a broader effort by Congress to obtain documents and bring administration officials and allies in for questioning. On Wednesday, the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr. to answer further questions. Earlier that day, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress over his refusal to hand over an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
    " Title: Secretary Clinton Takes Responsibility for Benghazi Consulate Attack, Denies Cover-up Allegations\n\nIn a recent interview, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepted responsibility for any security lapses leading up to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. However, she refuted claims of a cover-up, attributing the administration's evolving explanations for the attack to the \"fog of war.\"\n\nInitially, administration officials suggested that the attack was a spontaneous response to protests sparked by an anti-Islam film, but investigations now indicate that extremists linked to Al Qaeda orchestrated a premeditated, coordinated attack with no evidence of a protest preceding the consulate attack.\n\nSecretary Clinton explained the administration's shifting narrative by referring to the confusion that arises in combat situations, stating, \"Remember, this was an attack that went on for hours. There had to be a lot of sorting out... Everyone said, here's what we know, subject to change.\"\n\nThe Obama administration, particularly the State Department, has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill regarding the level of security at the consulate, with allegations that requests for increased protection were either denied or ignored. This topic was a focal point during the vice presidential debate, where Vice President Biden denied receiving any such requests. The White House later clarified that Biden was speaking for himself and the president, not for the State Department.\n\nClinton seemed to support Biden's claims, stating, \"I'm responsible for the State Department, for the more than 60,000 people around the world. The decisions about security are made by security professionals.\" She added, \"We're going to review everything to be sure we're doing what needs to be done in an increasingly risky environment.\"\n\nClinton also addressed the June explosion at the consulate in Benghazi, stating, \"I can't speak to who knew what. We knew there were security breaches and problems throughout Libya... It was taken into account by security professionals as they made their assessments.\"\n\nThree Republican senators, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte, issued a statement Monday, stating that Clinton's claim was \"a laudable gesture,\" but they placed the responsibility for the Benghazi attack and what they called \"an escalating pattern of attacks this year in Benghazi\" on President Obama and his national security team. They argued that if the president was unaware of the rising threat level in Benghazi, then his national security team has lost the confidence of the senators, but if he was aware, then the president bears full responsibility for any security failures.",
    " Title: Potential Discussions on Obamacare: What Changes Could Democrats and Republicans Agree On?\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the political landscape shifts, discussions between President Barack Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may resume. However, the scope of these talks is limited due to the lack of common ground between the two parties.\n\nPresident Obama has expressed his willingness to engage in discussions about his health care law, stating, \"If you disagree with certain aspects of it, tell us what you disagree with, and let's work on it.\"\n\nHowever, the types of incremental changes that wouldn't significantly impact the ACA, such as repealing the medical device tax, would not satisfy hardline Republicans. More substantial changes, such as delaying the individual mandate or the entire law, are non-starters for the White House.\n\nIf the focus shifts from the ACA to entitlements and health spending, the barriers remain substantial. While President Obama has proposed savings to Medicare and Social Security in his own budget, these would need to be part of a broader package that includes new revenues, a proposition that Republicans are unlikely to accept.\n\nPotential points of discussion in the event of ACA talks include:\n\n1. Delaying the individual mandate: This idea is central to the Republicans' \"fairness\" argument, as they question why individuals should not receive the same one-year reprieve from the requirement to obtain health coverage or pay fines as large employers. However, the individual mandate is directly linked to the coverage of individuals with pre-existing conditions, which begins on January 1. Delaying the mandate could disrupt the balance of healthy and sick individuals in the new insurance system, potentially leading to the \"insurance death spiral.\"\n\n2. Delaying the entire law for one year: This idea includes delaying pre-existing condition coverage. While this delay might be acceptable to the White House, there is a practical issue: People are already enrolling in Obamacare health plans with January 1 start dates. Delaying the law would create another public relations challenge, as the administration would have to inform these individuals that their coverage would be delayed.\n\n3. Repealing the medical device tax: This was one of the House Republicans' last proposals before the government shutdown and has garnered some Democratic support in the past. The goal is to eliminate the 2.3 percent tax on the sales price of medical devices by manufacturers and importers. However, repealing the device tax would result in a loss of $30 billion in revenue needed to fund the ACA.\n\n4. Repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund: This fund, authored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), is part of the health law but is not central to its operation. Republicans could push for its repeal, but this would likely be seen as a symbolic victory rather than a significant concession.\n\n5. Eliminating congressional subsidies: Republicans, such as Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), have been advocating for the repeal of subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs to receive health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges. However, the practical implications of this change are unclear, and it may not be a priority for Republicans due to potential staffing issues.\n\nIn summary, while discussions between President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders regarding the ACA may resume, finding common ground will be challenging. The potential changes under consideration, such as delaying the individual mandate, repealing the medical device tax, or eliminating congressional subsidies, may not satisfy either side fully, and further negotiations would be required to find a compromise.",
    " Title: Suspect in Charleston Church Shooting Apprehended in North Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift turn of events, Dylann Roof, the alleged perpetrator of a tragic shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina church, has been apprehended, authorities confirmed. Roof, aged 21, was arrested today during a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, approximately 250 miles north of Charleston.\n\nThe arrest took place after a citizen reported Roof's vehicle to the police, who then responded and made the arrest. Roof cooperated with the officer who stopped him, according to police.\n\nCharleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen expressed relief at a news conference, stating, \"I am so pleased we were able to resolve this case quickly.\"\n\nThe FBI and Charleston police had earlier identified Roof, of Lexington, South Carolina, as the suspect. On Wednesday night, Roof allegedly opened fire on a Bible study group at the historic predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street, resulting in the deaths of nine individuals. One other person was rushed to the hospital and later died, bringing the total number of fatalities to nine.\n\nInitially, police reported that two people were hospitalized, but later clarified that three people survived the shooting, although details about them were not immediately available.\n\nThe victims included Rev. Clementa Pinckney, church pastor and a South Carolina state senator, as well as Rev. Sharonda Singleton, retired pastor Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, Ethel Lee Lance, Cynthia Hurd, Myra Thompson, and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders.\n\nCharleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. described the suspect as a \"horrible scoundrel.\" Three of the victims were males, and six were females.\n\nEarly this morning, police released pictures from surveillance footage showing the suspect, a white man, approximately 21 to 25 years old, as well as the car he was driving. The suspect was described as approximately 5-foot-9, wearing a sweatshirt with distinctive markings and Timberland boots.\n\nFurther charges are expected, and Roof is expected to be charged with murder, allowing for him to be extradited. The investigation is ongoing, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 9525: Autopilot Reprogrammed, Co-Pilot's Apartment Searched in Crash Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators continue to piece together the events that led to the tragic crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, which killed all 150 people on board. New details have emerged suggesting that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, intentionally crashed the plane.\n\nTransponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data. The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds, with the captain, who was locked out of the cockpit, banging on the door and screaming heard on the recording for the final few minutes of the flight.\n\nPolice searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive. A search is underway for the plane's second \"black box,\" the flight data recorder, which could shed more light on the plane's final minutes. The French government has also asked the FBI to help investigate the crash.\n\nInvestigators are still baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane. He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time. Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen, Germany, and only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying, but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone.\n\nLufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired, and it is unclear whether Lubitz had any underlying issues that may have contributed to the crash. The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder.\n\nRelatives and friends of the victims traveled on special Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished. The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done, a process likely to last several weeks.\n\nThe disaster is not being described as a \"terrorist attack,\" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a \"suicide\" either. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said, \"If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide.\"\n\nThe investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. The aviation community and the world continue to mourn the loss of 150 lives.",
    " Title: Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson Eyes Opportunity in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a presidential election season marked by deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees, the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the race. This opportunity, to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking 'Trump' or 'Clinton' this November, is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee.\n\nFormer New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination, has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. One poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans \u2013 not exactly in contention, but nevertheless impressive for a party that\u2019s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election.\n\nWhether Johnson\u2019s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice, the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com, \"It\u2019s a combination of both.\"\n\nPresuming he can snag the nomination at the Memorial Day weekend convention, which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando, Johnson indicated he\u2019d happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option. Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday.\n\n\"The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third-party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states,\" he said. \"I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [the] third name in any polls, the recognizable figure that he is, [he] would be at 30 percent. But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\nWhile prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party, state ballot access will indeed be a challenge. As Johnson says, the Libertarian Party \u2013 already on 32 state ballots \u2013 will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November.\n\nUpping his potential appeal to #NeverTrump Republicans, Johnson tapped another former GOP governor, William Weld of Massachusetts, to be his running mate, both fiscal conservatives and social liberals.\n\n\"If conservative means smaller government, I think we are the proven commodity,\" Johnson said.\n\nHe is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates. But he believes if he\u2019s in the debates, the ticket could collect electoral votes.\n\n\"I would not be doing this if there wasn\u2019t the opportunity to actually win,\" Johnson said. \"New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, there are some real opportunities.\"\n\nThe 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable. His standing in the poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent. If the numbers hold, Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader\u2019s 3 percent in 2000, but still lag behind Ross Perot\u2019s 19 percent in 1992.\n\nJohnson\u2019s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history. Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections, but Johnson\u2019s poll numbers haven\u2019t always held up either. In the 2012 general election \u2013 when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian \u2013 he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote.\n\nStill, the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian, and if the party can build on that this year, it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November \u2013 though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen.\n\n\"A group of Republicans feel their party\u2019s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star. A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don\u2019t want to support a war hawk, who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Weld made waves by comparing Trump\u2019s deportation policy to Nazi tactics. But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either, and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected, government is going to expand. With regard to military and foreign policy, she has been an architect,\" Johnson said. \"Is anything going to change with regards to foreign policy? No.\"\n\nAbout 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando. The top contenders are Johnson, anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen, and 15 other candidates.\n\n\"If Johnson does not win on the first round, it will be mine,\" McAfee told FoxNews.com.\n\nJohnson, if nominated, could run into trouble with some conservatives \u2013 yet attract liberals \u2013 as a supporter of abortion rights and marijuana legalization. He also favors military cuts and a reserved foreign policy, while backing sweeping entitlement reforms, changes to the tax code, and term limits for members of Congress.\n\nJohnson and Weld, both two-term governors in the 1990s, were given A\u2019s in the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s Fiscal Policy Report Card for cutting spending and taxes.\n\n\"Two governors running against a candidate that has never held office and another who has not held executive office -- the Libertarians would be the most experienced ticket,\" Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz told FoxNews.com.\n\nHe added, \"But this year, experience isn\u2019t what people are looking for.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Army Soldier Charged with Sharing Deployment Information to Inspire Attacks\n\nA U.S. Army private stationed overseas has been indicted by a federal grand jury for attempting to provide information about his unit's planned deployment to extremist groups, with the intention of inciting attacks. The accused, Ethan Phelan Melzer, a 22-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, faces multiple federal attempted murder charges, carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nAccording to John Demers, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's national security division, Melzer \"planned a deadly ambush on his fellow soldiers in the service of a diabolical cocktail of ideologies laced with hate and violence.\"\n\nCourt documents reveal that Melzer began communicating with followers of the Order of the Nine Angles, a violent, satanic neo-Nazi fringe group, on a restricted messaging application in April. A month later, he started posting information about his Army unit, stationed in Italy, and its planned redeployment to a U.S. military base in Turkey, in an attempt to incite a jihadist attack.\n\nInvestigators claim that Melzer shared the location of a U.S. military installation, the nature of the weaponry his unit would be armed with, its vulnerabilities, and the number of soldiers stationed at the base, as well as other sensitive information. The FBI stated that they intercepted these communications, which led to the arrest of Melzer on June 10.\n\nFederal officials reported that the Army thwarted the plot in late May, and the FBI uncovered Melzer's confession. According to a charging document unsealed Monday, Melzer provided this information to the users of the messaging application to facilitate a mass casualty attack on the unit.\n\nThe Order of the Nine Angles, based in the U.K., has gained notoriety as a source of inspiration for violent American white supremacists. Brian Levin, a terrorism expert at California State University in San Bernardino, described the group as \"a decades-old extreme satanic Nazi cult whose glorification of violence and mysticism has found a renewed international audience, including some young violent American neo-Nazis.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center describes the Order of Nine Angles as \"an enigmatic Satanic occult group.\" Its most extreme adherents \"promote human sacrifice, Nazism and Fascism, and have been reported to praise Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nMelzer enlisted in the Army in 2018 and became a follower of the group the following year. By 2019, he had deployed overseas and was following propaganda from several extremist groups, according to investigators.\n\nAudrey Strauss, the acting US attorney in Manhattan, where the formal charges were filed, stated, \"Melzer was motivated by racism and hatred as he attempted to carry out this ultimate act of betrayal.\" No information about Melzer's defense lawyer was available at the time of this report.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Returns to Michigan as Likely Republican Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and likely Republican presidential nominee, has embarked on a journey back to his home state of Michigan, the final destination of a five-day, six-state Midwestern tour. In an interview with reporters on his campaign plane, Romney expressed optimism about his chances in Michigan, stating, \"I think Michigan's a state I can win.\"\n\nWhen asked if carrying the state in November would hold special significance, Romney replied, \"If I win in Michigan, then I become the president, and that would mean a lot to me personally.\" Romney was born in Michigan and raised in the suburbs outside Detroit. His father, George Romney, ran a car company - American Motors Corp. - and later served as the governor of the state.\n\nGeorge Romney unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, a prize his son is poised to claim at the Republican National Convention in August. Mitt Romney's political journey began nearly six years ago when he launched his unsuccessful bid for the 2008 GOP nomination.\n\nMichigan is one of several states that could determine the outcome in November. It is not on Romney's campaign's list of top targets, which includes traditionally Republican states like Virginia and North Carolina, and swing states like Ohio and Florida. However, it is one of a number of Rust Belt states President Barack Obama won in 2008 where Romney's campaign team sees an opportunity.\n\nDeputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage, a Michigan native, stated, \"There's another level of states that are all states that Obama won last time. And he won't win if he doesn't win them again.\" Romney faces an uphill battle in Michigan, with a strong Democratic base in Detroit, and he has already struggled to explain his opposition to the federal bailout that saved General Motors and Chrysler.\n\nRomney's 2012 campaign has been marked by frequent reminders of his Michigan roots. George Romney's photo was displayed on the campaign bus during the primary, and supporters bring Romney '68 memorabilia and stories about volunteering on his father's presidential campaign to rallies. Romney has spoken fondly of Vernors, a distinctive ginger ale popular in Michigan, and has been affectionate about the state's trees and the cars produced by the industry that has shaped Michigan's culture and economy.\n\nRomney's opposition to federal support for General Motors and Chrysler has been a contentious issue. During the primary, his comment about his wife, Ann, driving \"a couple of Cadillacs\" was criticized as out of touch with Americans struggling in a bad economy. Romney has also faced criticism for his stance on the auto industry bailouts, but his campaign has indicated that he may soften his tone on the issue.\n\n\"He's going to acknowledge, as he has, that President Obama and he ultimately shared the same goal, which was to see the auto industry survive and thrive,\" said Gage. \"They just had different ways of going about it. He's pleased to see that he does seem to be getting stronger.\"\n\nRomney's return to Michigan marks a significant milestone in his presidential campaign, and his efforts to win over the state's voters will be closely watched in the coming months.",
    " Title: Anticipating Bipartisan Tone and Fashion Statements in Obama's Second-Term State of the Union Address\n\nThe highly anticipated State of the Union address by President Barack Obama will be delivered on Tuesday, marking the beginning of his second-term agenda. Here are five key aspects to watch for during the speech:\n\n1. Bipartisan Progress and Challenges: Sources suggest that the president will highlight bipartisan progress on immigration reform, but he is expected to take a firm stance on debt and tax reform. The balance between these points of agreement and areas of contention will serve as an early indicator of the administration's approach to bipartisan cooperation.\n\n2. Policy Priorities: The State of the Union address is often a policy laundry list, and this year's speech is expected to be no exception. Issues such as U.S. policy in Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and the security of U.S. diplomatic posts are likely to be addressed, along with domestic concerns like poverty and U.S. use of unmanned drones.\n\n3. Economic Themes: Aides have indicated that this speech will focus heavily on economic themes. However, the amount of time dedicated to other issues, such as gay rights, women's rights, climate change, and education, will provide insight into the president's priorities beyond the economy.\n\n4. Michelle Obama's Fashion: First Lady Michelle Obama's fashion choices have become a significant part of the State of the Union event, with her outfits often serving as one of the night's most surprising elements. This year, speculation is rife about whether she will repeat her 2009 arm-baring style.\n\n5. Rhetorical Impact: State of the Union addresses are not typically remembered for their oratory, with presidents often using these speeches to outline policy goals rather than deliver memorable speeches. However, the rhetoric used to address these policy points will be closely scrutinized, particularly in light of the president's inaugural address themes, which include gay rights, women's rights, climate change, and education.\n\nAs the president delivers his address, these five aspects will provide a comprehensive view of the administration's priorities and approach to the second term.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Acknowledged Inaccuracy in \"You Can Keep Your Health Plan\" Promise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that has sparked controversy, the Obama Administration has admitted that a significant number of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), contradicting a key promise made by President Obama during the health reform plan's promotion.\n\nThe Obama Administration revised a \"grandfathering\" provision that would have allowed most Americans to maintain their existing insurance policies. However, the revisions led to an estimated 40% to 67% of all members in the individual health insurance market losing their plans.\n\nThe law stipulates that policies in effect as of March 23, 2010, would be \"grandfathered,\" allowing consumers to keep those policies despite not meeting the new health care law's requirements. However, the Department of Health and Human Services narrowed this provision by stating that if any part of a policy was significantly changed since the key date\u2014such as deductibles, copays, or benefits\u2014the policy would not be grandfathered.\n\nBuried in Obamacare regulations from July 2010 is an estimate that, due to normal turnover in the individual insurance market, \"40 to 67 percent\" of customers would not be able to keep their policy. Furthermore, because many policies have been changed since the key date, \"the percentage of individual market policies losing grandfather status in a given year exceeds the 40 to 67 percent range.\"\n\nThe Obama Administration's assurance that Americans could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare has been met with skepticism, and it now appears that they did not believe their own rhetoric. Despite this, President Obama continued to make the same promise to Americans, even in last year's debates with his rival Mitt Romney.\n\nThe reason for the cancellation of insurance plans and the increased cost of new plans is due to the Obama Administration's new minimum guidelines for what insurance must cover. The Administration maintains that the new insurance is better, but this assertion is being met with resistance, as demonstrated by the case of Jacqueline Proctor, a 60-year-old Californian whose new insurance must cover childcare and maternity care, services she will never use. Her new insurance will cost \"more than twice as much\" as her old insurance.",
    " Title: Judges' Skepticism Towards Flynn Case Dismissal Raises Questions for Justice Department\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent hearing, Judges Henderson and Rao, known for their favorable interpretations of the law towards the Trump administration in other politically charged cases, expressed skepticism towards the Justice Department's motion to dismiss the case against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. This development, unexpected given their previous leanings, has raised questions about the future of the case.\n\nThe three-judge panel, to which the judges were randomly assigned, seemed to agree that U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan had the power to hold a hearing, a decision that could potentially be detrimental to the Justice Department.\n\nDeputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall argued that the department would face significant challenges if it was required to defend itself against the brief written by former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and critic of Attorney General William Barr, Michael J. Gleeson. The department, Wall contended, would have to disclose internal deliberations, including the reason why no career prosecutor signed the motion to dismiss the charge against Flynn, in a potentially \"politicized\" atmosphere.\n\nWall expressed concern about the potential harm to the executive branch, stating, \"There are real harms here and if we know what has to happen at the end of the day, with all respect, district court should be directed to do it now rather than have some unnecessary and very harmful proceedings.\"\n\nThe arguments left unclear what would happen if Judge Sullivan were to reject the Justice Department's motion to dismiss the case. Judge Henderson, in particular, seemed to take a skeptical view of Gleeson's brief, suggesting that Judge Sullivan may have chosen an \"intemperate\" person to critique the Justice Department's move. However, she did not take a position on whether a judge could sentence a defendant who had pleaded guilty even though the executive branch no longer wanted to pursue the case.",
    " Title: Senate Healthcare Bill Repeal Efforts Collapse as Lisa Murkowski Joins Democrats in Blocking Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Republican-led attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has suffered a major setback. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) has announced her decision to vote with the Democrats to block the repeal-only health bill, effectively killing the measure. This marks the third Republican Senator to vote against the repeal, making it impossible for the bill to pass.\n\nThe development comes as a blow to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who had reportedly planned to hold a vote to proceed on the 2015 repeal bill, despite the likelihood of its failure. This move would have forced every Senator to go on record regarding their stance on the issue.\n\nSources indicate that McConnell's intention to hold a vote to proceed on the straight repeal bill is a strategic move. Some speculate that he may be using this threat as leverage to revive the compromise bill, while others suggest that he is frustrated with his recalcitrant conference and wants to subject his members to tough votes.\n\nHowever, this strategy could potentially put some Senators in the line of fire for avoidable blowback. The move also risks further highlighting the Republican Party's inability to deliver on a long-standing campaign promise, an issue that is not likely to go unnoticed by voters.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to jumpstart new bipartisan talks have begun. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has initiated bipartisan health care talks with former governors turned senators. However, the anti-conservative demands from even the most \"moderate\" of Democrats could pose challenges in these negotiations.\n\nAs the healthcare debate continues, the Senate remains divided, and the future of the Affordable Care Act remains uncertain. The failure to repeal and replace the healthcare law is a significant setback for the Republican Party, and the road to bipartisan agreement may be long and arduous.",
    " Title: President Trump and Vice President Pence Celebrate Christmas with U.S. Troops Overseas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence took time to express their gratitude and well-wishes to U.S. troops stationed around the world, who are unable to be with their families during the Christmas holiday.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump hosted a video teleconference with troops stationed in Kuwait, Qatar, Guantanamo Bay, and aboard the USS Sampson. During the call, he thanked them for their service and wished them a Merry Christmas.\n\n\"I just want to wish everybody a very, very merry Christmas. We say Merry Christmas, again, very, very proudly. Very, very merry Christmas. We're going to have a great year, an incredible year. I'm thrilled to bring season's greetings on behalf of the first lady and our entire family, and most importantly, on behalf of the American people,\" Trump said, according to the White House pool report.\n\nHe continued, \"As we celebrate this most precious holiday, we're grateful for each of you who spend this Christmas away from our families and defend all of our families, our freedom, and our flag. Every American heart is thankful, and we're asking God to watch over you and to watch over your families.\"\n\nThe media covering his initial remarks were ushered out of the room so the President could have a personal conversation with the individuals on the call.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Afghanistan last week. In a tweet, he expressed his wishes for renewed strength during the holiday season and shared a message of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men.\n\n\"For all who, in the coming days, will look to a manger & claim the promise announced on a Holy Night of peace on Earth & good will toward men-from the First Family, my family & families across America: Merry Christmas,\" Pence tweeted.\n\nBoth leaders' messages serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by U.S. troops and their families during the holiday season, and the gratitude and support felt by the American people.",
    " Title: Clinton's Negative Perception in Key Swing States Raises Concerns for 2016 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is facing a significant challenge in the form of negative perceptions among voters in key swing states. A series of recent polls have shown that a majority of voters in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia hold an unfavorable view of Clinton.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, 56 percent of Colorado voters view Clinton unfavorably, compared to only 35 percent who view her favorably. The gap is similar in Iowa (56 percent negative to 33 percent positive) and only somewhat diminished in Virginia (50 percent favorable to 41 percent negative). The poll had a margin of error of +/- 2.8 percentage points in all three states.\n\nIn comparison, her unfavorable scores are close to those of Donald Trump, the most polarizing Republican candidate on the trail and the Republican with the worst favorability numbers in the poll. By contrast, more voters rated Scott Walker and Marco Rubio favorably than unfavorably in all three states. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, was viewed more unfavorably in Colorado and Iowa, but did not have any gaps the size of Clinton's.\n\nHowever, some Democratic pollsters are pushing back against the Quinnipiac poll, arguing that Clinton's standing is better than the polls suggest. Geoff Garin, a top strategist on Clinton's 2008 campaign, wrote in an email to NPR that \"Her standing is better than the [Quinnipiac] polls suggest,\" adding that these numbers are \"inconsistent with other polling.\"\n\nDespite the pushback, other polls do reinforce that Clinton may have a perception problem. In several swing states, voters do not think she is honest or trustworthy. In the same Quinnipiac poll, Coloradans, Iowans, and Virginians all said by wide margins that they do not consider Clinton honest or trustworthy. In a Quinnipiac poll from June, voters in three other states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014were also more likely to find her untrustworthy than trustworthy. This sentiment extends beyond swing states, as well. In a June nationwide CNN poll, 57 percent of voters said they did not find Clinton trustworthy.\n\nThe negative perceptions of Clinton are not limited to trustworthiness. Quinnipiac has found that in six swing states, voters are either split or negative on whether they believe Clinton cares about their needs and problems.\n\nSo what's a candidate to do? One pollster suggested having realistic expectations about changing people's minds, while another suggested focusing on Clinton's strengths, such as her leadership skills. Clinton has one bright spot that pops up in state after state in these polls\u2014her leadership skills. Even when voters view her unfavorably, think she does not understand their problems, or say she is untrustworthy, they also view her as a strong leader.\n\nIn fact, simply emphasizing her leadership credentials and skills could be a way to make people feel that Clinton is more trustworthy and authentic. Democratic strategist Craig Varoga suggested that Clinton should use her leadership as an opportunity to speak bluntly and authentically about the issues that matter to people in the country.\n\nVaroga added that there is one other important thing to remember when looking at any poll about how voters feel about 2016 candidates. \"This is in many ways a completely lousy time to run for president,\" he said. Frustration with politicians is off the charts, he added, and that means well-established candidates like Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush are facing a testier electorate than candidates in previous races have faced. \"There's a very high level of dissatisfaction with the status quo,\" Varoga noted, \"and there's a very large minority inside each party that wants something completely different.\"\n\nThis has helped candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump post high numbers in polls, Varoga says. And that support itself hints that, for Clinton or any number of mainstream Republican candidates, making voters like them could just be tougher this time around.",
    " Title: \"Political Engagement, Media Preferences, and Lifestyle Choices of Consistent Conservatives in the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is set to commence this week, with a dozen or so potential Republican presidential candidates, including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, and Ted Cruz, in attendance. The event, hosted by the American Conservative Union, will see activists, officeholders, campaign consultants, and others discuss political issues and strategies.\n\nA recent series of reports by Pew Research Center on political polarization has shed light on the ideological leanings of Americans. The reports used a 10-item scale of ideological consistency to categorize Americans into five groups: consistently conservative or liberal, mostly conservative or liberal, and mixed. According to these reports, 9% of the public overall is consistently conservative, including 20% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nHere are five key findings from Pew Research Center's reports about consistent conservatives:\n\n1. Consistent conservatives are more politically engaged than most other ideological groups. Half of consistent conservatives have contacted an elected official within the past two years, the highest level among the five groups. This political engagement is also evident in other areas, such as donating money (26%), attending campaign events (24%), and volunteering on a campaign (12%).\n\n2. Consistent conservatives had a significant influence in the November 2014 midterm elections. Although they make up only about 9% of the total adult population, they vote at higher rates than other ideological groups, with 78% saying they always vote. This high voter turnout led to an estimated 17% of the 2014 electorate being consistent conservatives.\n\n3. Consistent conservatives prefer non-urban lifestyles. The survey found that 41% of consistent conservatives would choose to live in a rural area, and 35% would prefer a small town. In contrast, only 4% would opt for a city.\n\n4. When it comes to raising children, consistent conservatives prioritize responsibility, faith, and hard work. When asked about the three most important traits to teach children, 61% of consistent conservatives cited \"being responsible,\" 59% identified religious faith as particularly important, and 44% chose hard work.\n\n5. Consistent conservatives tend to gravitate toward Fox News. The report on polarization and media habits found that 47% of consistent conservatives (and 31% of people with mostly conservative views) cited Fox News as their main source for news about government and politics. This preference is reflected in the high level of trust (88%) that consistent conservatives have in Fox News, the highest level of trust by any ideological group for any single news source.\n\nThese findings offer insights into the political landscape, media preferences, and lifestyle choices of consistent conservatives in the United States.",
    " Title: Obama Announces Federal Intervention to Lower College Costs and Rate Schools on Educational Value\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to address the rising costs of college and make higher education more accessible, President Obama announced on Thursday that the federal government will take a more active role in pushing schools to lower costs. The President made the announcement during a two-day bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania, as he seeks to revitalize his domestic agenda amid budget and partisan battles on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe President's plan includes capping student loan repayments at 10 percent of future paychecks and implementing measures to ensure students attending school on federal grants stay in school by doling out the money in installments.\n\nTo evaluate the educational value of colleges, the President announced that the Education Department will compile and release a scorecard beginning in 2015. The scorecard will rate colleges based on affordability, productivity, and access. Affordability will be measured by comparing tuition costs to the number of students taking loans or receiving scholarships. Productivity will be measured by graduation rates and the earnings of graduates. Access will be measured by the percentage of students who receive federal aid.\n\nBy 2018, after the scorecard has been refined, federal funding will be tailored to reward schools that accept low-income students and perform well according to the rest of the formula. The plan also encourages colleges and universities to explore new methods of education, such as lower-cost online courses and awarding degrees based on what students have learned, rather than the number of classes they have taken.\n\nCongress will need to approve the President's plan to dock schools' federal funds for poor performance on the Education Department scorecard, and lawmakers will also need to pass legislation to cap student loan repayments at 10 percent of postgraduate incomes. The Higher Education Act, which is set to expire at the end of this year, will need to be debated and reauthorized.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have expressed mixed reactions to the President's plan. Rep. John Kline, Minnesota Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, agrees with the President's idea of promoting innovation among colleges but sees the proposed ranking system as \"arbitrary\" and potentially stifling innovation. Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, sees areas where his party can work with the President to control costs, but he urges the President to call on colleges to limit executive salaries. Grassley also emphasizes the importance of empowering students and parents to make informed decisions about college costs.\n\n\"The more students and parents become savvy shoppers, the more colleges would be forced to rein in rising costs to compete for students,\" Grassley said. The President's plan aims to make higher education more affordable and accessible for all, while encouraging innovation and accountability in the higher education system.",
    " Title: CNN Announces Seven-Hour Climate Change Town Hall, Allocating 40 Minutes for Each Candidate\n\nIn a move that has been described as ambitious, CNN has announced a seven-hour climate change town hall, scheduled for September 4th. The extended duration is intended to provide each of the ten participating Democratic presidential candidates with ample time to discuss their plans to address climate change.\n\nThe town hall will be moderated by a team of CNN anchors, including Wolf Blitzer, Erin Burnett, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, and Don Lemon. The candidates' appearances will be staggered throughout the event, with specific times allocated as follows:\n\n- Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro will be interviewed by CNN's Wolf Blitzer at 5 p.m. ET.\n- Businessman Andrew Yang, who will also be interviewed by Blitzer, will come on at 5:40 p.m.\n- California Sen. Kamala Harris will be interviewed by CNN's Erin Burnett at 6:20 p.m.\n- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who will also be interviewed by Burnett, will appear at 7 p.m.\n- Former Vice President Joe Biden will be interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper at 8 p.m.\n- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who will also be interviewed by Cooper, will be on at 8:40 p.m.\n- Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will be interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo at 9:20 p.m.\n- South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who will also be interviewed by Cuomo at 10 p.m.\n- Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke will appear with CNN's Don Lemon at 10:40 p.m.\n- New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will also be interviewed by Lemon and will come on at 11:20 p.m.\n\nThe extended format of the town hall is a response to the Democratic National Committee's decision last week not to host a debate focused solely on climate change. According to previous CNN polls, 96 percent of Democratic voters want \"aggressive\" action taken to address climate change.\n\nWhile the seven-hour format may be unprecedented for a prime-time event, some question whether the length will be sustainable for viewers. With three-hour debates already proving challenging, the extended town hall has raised eyebrows in the media industry. However, with CNN's ratings reportedly down, the town hall could potentially serve as a ratings boost for the network.",
    " Title: Sen. Tom Coburn Critiques 2013 as a Year of Dysfunction and Disregard for Founding Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing critique, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) has described 2013 as a year that may go down in history as one of the worst for the republic, due to a perceived disregard for the country's founding principles and governmental responsibilities. In a piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Coburn lamented the \"unwinding\" of the country's founding principles and the \"rule of rulers\" over the \"rule of law.\"\n\nCoburn, a longtime critic of government waste, cited several instances of what he perceived as executive overreach and disregard for the law. He pointed to the troubled rollout of President Obama's health care law and the president's broken promise that Americans could keep their health care plans if they liked them. The Tampa Bay Times' PolitiFact named this promise the \"Lie of the Year.\"\n\nCoburn also criticized the Obama administration for taking unilateral, extralegal action, such as delaying the employer mandate for a year when the administration realized the law would cause trouble for businesses. He also accused the administration of ignoring immigration and border-security laws, reimposing a deep-water drilling moratorium after it was struck down in court, and stonewalling over allegations of Internal Revenue Service agents harassing political enemies.\n\nCoburn also noted Congress's low approval rating of 6 percent and criticized the Senate's move to change the filibuster rules to require only a simple majority for confirmation of most executive appointments. He also criticized the Senate for ignoring the Constitution and appointing people without Senate confirmation.\n\nCoburn also pointed to his annual Wastebook report, which highlighted instances of government funding for projects such as the study of romance novels, providing military benefits to the Fort Hood shooter, and helping the State Department buy Facebook fans.\n\nCoburn concluded by urging Americans to demand a course correction in the coming year, stating, \"If you don't like the rulers you have, you don't have to keep them.\" He suggested that the low approval rating of Congress and the administration presents an opportunity for change.",
    " Title: Deadly Easter Sunday Bombings Rock Sri Lanka, Killing Nearly 300 and Injuring Hundreds More\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Sri Lanka experienced a series of coordinated bombings on Easter Sunday, resulting in the death of nearly 300 people and injuring hundreds more. The attacks targeted churches, luxury hotels, and other sites across the country, marking the deadliest violence in Sri Lanka since the end of its civil war a decade ago.\n\nDefense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena described the blasts as a terrorist attack by religious extremists, and police reported the arrest of 13 suspects, although no immediate claim of responsibility has been made. Wijewardena stated that most of the bombings were believed to have been suicide attacks.\n\nThe explosions, primarily in and around Colombo, the capital, caused ceilings to collapse and windows to shatter, resulting in a grim scene of smoke, soot, blood, broken glass, screams, and wailing alarms. Worshippers and hotel guests were among the casualties.\n\nBhanuka Harischandra, a 24-year-old founder of a tech marketing company from Colombo, was en route to the Shangri-La Hotel for a meeting when it was bombed. \"People were being dragged out,\" he recounted. \"People didn't know what was going on. It was panic mode.\"\n\nMost of the victims were Sri Lankan nationals. However, the three bombed hotels and one of the churches, St. Anthony's Shrine, are frequented by foreign tourists. The Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry reported that at least 27 foreign nationals from various countries were among the deceased.\n\nIn response to the violence, the Sri Lankan government imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and blocked most social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, to curtail the spread of false information and ease tension in the country of approximately 21 million people.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed fears that the massacre could lead to instability in Sri Lanka and vowed to \"vest all necessary powers with the defense forces\" to take action against those responsible.\n\nCardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, called for the merciless punishment of those responsible, stating, \"Only animals can behave like that.\"\n\nAccording to police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, at least 290 people were killed, and at least 500 were wounded. Police found a safe house and a van used by the attackers.\n\nThe scale of the bloodshed recalls the worst days of Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war, during which the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group from the ethnic Tamil minority, sought independence from the Buddhist-majority country. The Tamils are Hindu, Muslim, and Christian.\n\nAlthough there have been scattered incidents of anti-Christian harassment in recent years, nothing on this scale has occurred since Easter Sunday. There is also no history of violent Muslim militants in Sri Lanka, but tensions have been running high between hard-line Buddhist monks and Muslims.\n\nTwo Muslim groups in Sri Lanka condemned the church attacks, as did countries worldwide, and Pope Francis expressed condolences at the end of his traditional Easter Sunday blessing in Rome.\n\nSix nearly simultaneous blasts took place in the morning at the shrine and the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La, and Kingsbury hotels in Colombo, as well as at two churches outside Colombo. A few hours later, two more blasts occurred just outside Colombo, one of them at a guesthouse, where two people were killed, and the other near an overpass.\n\nThree police officers were killed during a search at a suspected safe house on the outskirts of Colombo when its occupants apparently detonated explosives to prevent arrest, authorities said.\n\nThe Shangri-La's second-floor restaurant was gutted, with the ceiling and windows blown out.

    " Title: Shake Shack Executives Call for Improvements to Paycheck Protection Program Amid Confusion and Financial Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nShake Shack Inc., the popular burger chain, has returned a $10 million loan it received from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) due to the program's complex application process. The PPP is a part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, designed to provide financial aid to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a joint letter posted to LinkedIn, Shake Shack's Chief Executive Randy Garutti and Danny Meyer, the company's founder, expressed their concerns about the PPP's application process. \"The onus was placed on each business to figure out how, when, or even if to apply,\" they wrote. \"The 'PPP' came with no user manual and it was extremely confusing.\"\n\nAccording to a Treasury Department information sheet, the PPP is open to businesses with 500 or fewer employees. Shake Shack, with an average of about 45 workers per location, has 189 restaurants in the U.S. and nearly 8,000 workers.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused $1.5 million in weekly operating losses for Shake Shack, the letter stated. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts report that 84% of Shake Shack's company-owned restaurants are in counties with at least 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with none of the company's locations in a county with fewer than 50 cases.\n\nDanny Meyer, Shake Shack's founder, is also the CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group, which operates high-end restaurants such as Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Caf\u00e9, and Maialino. The closure of these restaurants led to the layoff of more than 2,000 employees.\n\nThe executives suggest improvements to the PPP, such as assigning a local bank to each applicant to avoid issues that arise if a restaurant doesn't have a pre-existing loan or banking relationship. The Small Business Administration announced that the program ran out of money last Thursday.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association has asked Congress for $240 billion in relief, stating that 40% of restaurants have closed, some permanently, and eight million workers have been furloughed. Before the pandemic, restaurants employed more than 12.2 million workers in the U.S.\n\nThe NRA estimates $240 billion in restaurant losses by the end of the year.",
    " Title: The Evolution of John McCain's Political Career: A Retrospective Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the dissolution of John McCain's old fan club signifies a significant shift in the political climate, as former McCainiacs can now be found among various political groups, including neocons, deplorables, Clintonites, and Bernie Bros. This transformation is not as unusual as it may seem.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, McCain's rebellion against the Republican establishment represented a desire shared by many Americans, during a time when the country generally supported the policies of Bill Clinton, if not the man himself. The Republican Party was careful to maintain a centrist stance in their rhetoric, and issues such as immigration, war, and trade were divisive but not as contentious as they would become.\n\nThe changes in the political landscape over the years have led to a shift in the issues that define the Establishment. Rebelling against the G.O.P. establishment in 1999 meant defying the donor class on taxes and the religious right on social issues. However, rebelling against it in 2016 meant defying the donor class on trade and immigration and siding with the religious right on social issues. McCain's earlier fans sorted themselves accordingly.\n\nMcCain, at times, seemed bitter, and this may have been due to the immense shifts in the public mood. Politicians, more than most people, learn to cope with swings in the public mood, but those who have enjoyed a period of marked resonance, when everything they say triggers sympathetic reverberations with the masses, have it hard when that stretch runs out. McCain was going fairly strong in 2004, but the formula of 2000 could no longer work.\n\nBy the time McCain finally secured a presidential nomination in 2008, it was at exactly the wrong time. What everybody wanted\u2014peace, a break from Bush-era policies, and a fair and sensible way out of a financial crash\u2014McCain couldn't offer. What he could offer, resolute leadership in war, nobody wanted.\n\nThe 2008 campaign showed McCain at his best and worst. To the consternation of many Republicans, he eschewed all advice to hit Barack Obama for his association with radical preacher Jeremiah Wright. He made a proposal to the Obama campaign that the two candidates do 10 town halls together, and the idea, while self-serving, was still wonderful.\n\nMcCain also stuck to his pledge, one that was broken by Obama, to use public financing for his campaign. At the same time, McCain shocked many of his admirers by picking as his running mate Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, someone exceptionally unsuited to the role. Palin's virtues (sense of humor, love of country, informality) were entirely inadequate in the face of her vices (insecurity, ignorance, self-deception), all of which were brought out under the glare of a national campaign. It made McCain look reckless and cynical.\n\nAfter 2008, McCain managed to frustrate nearly everyone. Democrats became enraged when McCain joined his fellow Republicans in partisan politics to weaken Obama. Republicans became enraged when McCain voted to confirm nominees or pass immigration amnesties. Because he broke ranks, because he was independent at one moment yet partisan the next, people tried to impose defamatory theories on him to make the pieces line up. Some Democrats found it easiest just to call McCain a phony and a hack. Some Republicans found it easiest to say McCain was actuated by sanctimony and spite. In the far-rightish world, you could even read lengthy arguments that McCain had been a stooge of the Viet Cong. Each theory had very little predictive power, however. A simpler explanation is that McCain, while at times expedient or partisan, preserved more independence of mind than is customary in his trade.",
    " Title: After New York Victory, Trump and Clinton Advance Towards Potential Knockout Round in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the 2016 presidential race witnessed a significant shift on Tuesday as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton secured convincing victories in their home state of New York. Both candidates won approximately three-fifths of the vote, significantly widening their lead in pledged delegates.\n\nThe victories in New York have opened a pathway for both Trump and Clinton to potentially secure their nominations before the conventions begin in July. In recent weeks, doubts had arisen as both front-runners seemed to lose momentum, and the possibility of open conventions in both Cleveland and Philadelphia had been discussed. However, after New York, the pressure is back on the challengers, who will find fewer opportunities to narrow the delegate gap with each passing week.\n\nThe next best chance for challengers to stop either Trump or Clinton may be next week, when Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware hold the next-to-last round of multistate primaries. A total of 144 delegates will be available for Republicans and 392 for Democrats. There will not be a comparable package until the season's final day on June 7.\n\nA sweep for either front-runner next week would make stopping Trump or Clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible. Even the chances of a second ballot at either convention would go from forbidding to remote.\n\nDonald Trump was declared the winner shortly after polls closed, tallying 60 percent of the statewide vote. When counting ended, Trump was poised to claim all 14 at-large delegates and about 75 of the 81 delegates awarded by congressional district.\n\nHillary Clinton did almost as well as Trump in percentage terms with 58 percent, while she outpolled Trump in the raw vote by nearly half a million. She did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as Trump, but only because the Democrats divide their delegates proportionally - both statewide and district by district. She took home an estimated 135 new delegates to Sanders' 104. She already had 39 of the state's 44 superdelegates (who are free to change their minds).\n\nThe outcomes may have been equally discouraging for challengers in both parties. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, winners in Wisconsin and in a handful of caucus states that lent them momentum in the weeks since mid-March, stumbled badly in the Empire State. Both had hoped to at least limit the damage they would suffer on Trump's and Clinton's turf, while looking to friendlier venues ahead.\n\nHowever, the front-runners ran roughshod across the landscape. Cruz finished a weak third with scarcely 1 vote in 7, earning zero delegates. New York Republicans preferred Ohio governor John Kasich, who got 1 vote in 4 statewide and gained perhaps three or more delegates (his first since he won his home state a month earlier).\n\nBruising as the loss was for Cruz, it may have been just as bitter for Sanders on the Democratic side. Clinton only increased her delegate lead by about 30 in the crucial category of pledged delegates. But the real pain for her rival was the opportunity cost. Sanders' team had given it their all in New York, outspending Clinton on TV and hoping visibly for an upset - or at least a narrow loss that could be spun as a moral victory.\n\nTrump, with his delegate lead growing again, can look to another stretch of promising ground next week. Polls give him an edge in all five contests, with 144 delegates at stake. A sweep would greatly enhance his chances of reaching the majority of delegates needed for a first-ballot nomination (1,237).\n\nThere is an active \"stop Trump\" movement, both in social media and in the higher circles of the GOP establishment. Senators seeking re-election in swing states have been advised to stay away from Trump and even to skip the convention.\n\nCruz has been successful in certain states in placing sympathizers in delegate slots that are committed to Trump on the first ballot. The individuals who occupy those slots would be expected to defect from Trump on later ballots.\n\nHowever, all that will be moot if Trump can get close enough to the magic number that a few pre-convention deals might well put him over the top. After a win like he scored in New York, such a \"last mile\" strategy looks increasingly plausible.\n\nFor her part, Clinton was sounding equally sanguine just blocks away, telling a throng of her supporters that the race was \"in the homestretch and victory is in sight.\" She did not say it, but Sanders now needs to win 60 percent of the delegates in every contest remaining - just to overtake Clinton in pledged delegates. He has no discernible path to turning around her advantage in superdelegates.\n\nNeither candidate's race is over yet. Weeks and months of pre-convention politicking remain. But after next week, it is possible that - for one or both of the front-runners - it will no longer be far from over.",
    " Title: Media's Polarized Reactions to Obama's State of the Union Address and Marco Rubio's Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast of reactions, the media's response to President Obama's State of the Union address and Florida Senator Marco Rubio's rebuttal speech was markedly different. If Santa Claus had delivered a similar speech, it might have received a similar level of media adoration as Obama's address.\n\nIn his speech, President Obama outlined a list of government investments, using the term \"invest\" 11 times, indicating government spending that would be funded by taxpayers' dollars. The media, particularly MSNBC and CNN, praised the speech, with MSNBC's Ed Schultz calling it \"a stunning speech tonight,\" and CNN's Jessica Yellin describing Obama as \"relaxed and confident.\"\n\nHowever, when it came to Rubio's response, the media's reaction was far from positive. Rubio's speech, which promoted the classic conservative view that opportunity is not bestowed on individuals from Washington, was met with criticism, particularly over a seemingly innocuous action - reaching off-screen to take a sip of water.\n\nMSNBC and CNN both dwelled on the water incident, with host Rachel Maddow commenting on Rubio's \"big reach for the water glass,\" and Chris Matthews describing the speech as \"tinker toys\" and \"primitive.\" Former RNC head and MSNBC analyst Michael Steele added his own criticism, stating, \"I did not like the water bottle.\"\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo made a reaching joke and even mimicked Rubio's water-grabbing action. The incident was replayed multiple times, as if it were a Super Bowl touchdown. In contrast, Obama's speech received far nicer treatment, with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer describing the emotional moment when victims of gun violence stood and cheered as \"perhaps the most powerful and emotional moment of the president's speech.\"\n\nOn Twitter, media critic Howard Kurtz wrote, \"Twitter going off on Marco Rubio water bottle. Really dousing him,\" while E.J. Dionne, a Washington Post liberal columnist, Tweeted, \"Poor Marco Rubio: It was the gulp that roared. TV can be a cruel medium #sotu.\" The Nation's Greg Mitchell described it as the \"Return of the Swig Party.\"\n\nThe media's focus on Rubio's water bottle incident overshadowed the twin realities of the Obama speech - taxes and spending. Former GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich described the speech as \"the most pro-government speech since Lyndon Johnson,\" while Rubio reminded viewers that the sequester and the resulting cuts were Obama's idea in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's reactions to the State of the Union address and the rebuttal speech were polarized, with the media praising Obama's speech and criticizing Rubio's, particularly over a seemingly innocuous action. The media's focus on Rubio's water bottle incident overshadowed the real issues at hand, such as taxes, spending, and the role of government in the economy.",
    " Title: Romney Takes Aim at Media Bias at Al Smith Dinner, While Scholar Paul Kengor Accuses Media of Protecting Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a light-hearted yet pointed jab at the media, Mitt Romney, speaking at the Al Smith dinner, took on the press, suggesting that they have a role in protecting President Obama rather than exposing him. Romney's comments, while delivered in jest, were met with laughter and applause from the audience.\n\nRomney, in his speech, highlighted instances of what he perceived as media bias, stating, \"When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls, what was the headline? 'Polls Show Obama Leading from Behind.' And I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: 'Obama Embraced by Catholics. Romney Dines with Rich People.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Paul Kengor, author of the book \"The Communist,\" which exposes President Obama's relationship with Communist Party operative Frank Marshall Davis, told Breitbart News that the media's job is to protect Obama, not to expose him. Kengor's book, released in July, has not received attention from mainstream media outlets.\n\nKengor's book reveals that Frank Marshall Davis was the Communist Party operative mentioned in Obama's memoir, \"Dreams from My Father.\" The connection between Obama and Davis was first made public in 2007 by Gerald Horne, a Communist Party writer. Blogger Trevor Loudon wrote about the connection the same year, and the identification of \"Frank\" as Frank Marshall Davis was confirmed by Accuracy in Media (AIM) on February 18, 2008, in a column titled \"Obama's Communist Mentor.\"\n\nKengor stated that he has not received any inquiries from mainstream media journalists about his book or his analysis of Davis and Obama's relationship. \"Are you kidding? No way. Not a chance,\" Kengor said when asked about media interest in his work.\n\nKengor accused the media of being political partisans first and journalists second, stating, \"They aren't honest, or they delude themselves on a grand scale. They've sacrificed their noble profession to an ignoble political ideology.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign has chosen not to attack media bias, despite the potential impact of liberal media bias on the election. Tim Groseclose, author of \"Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind,\" told AIM that the leftward bias of the media has shifted the political quotient of the average American by about 20 points on a scale of 100, conditioning the public to accept Democratic Party candidates and policies.\n\nAt the AIM \"ObamaNation\" conference on September 21, pollster Pat Caddell urged Romney to openly run against \"two organizations\" - the Democratic Party and the \"mainstream media.\" Caddell stated that the media have \"made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy, and, in my opinion, made themselves the enemy of the American people\" because they hide information critical to making informed decisions in a democracy.\n\nDespite the media's lack of interest in Kengor's book, the subject of Frank Marshall Davis is gaining attention through other means. The Joel Gilbert DVD, \"Dreams from My Real Father,\" is being mailed to millions of households in swing states. While Gilbert's theory about Davis being Obama's real father is subject to debate, his film does cite factual data about Davis' relationship with Obama and notes the existence of the 600-page FBI file on Davis.\n\nIf there is nothing to hide in this relationship, Paul Kengor told Breitbart News, then why did Obama himself delete the references to \"Frank\" in the audio version of his book, \"Dreams from My Father\"? Kengor noted that Obama narrates the audio version, and the back cover of the audio states, \"This abridgment has been approved by the author.\" Kengor stated, \"Frank appears in every section of the memoir, all three parts, starting in Hawaii and then when Obama thinks of him later in Africa, Europe, Chicago. It's not like Frank appears only on pages, say, 15-22. He appears throughout the text. It's eerie to be reading the book in hard cover, and listening simultaneously to the audio, and see and hear everything the same, line to line, sentence to sentence, paragraph after paragraph, page upon page, and then suddenly, on a dime, out of the blue, come upon a printed sentence or paragraph that mentions 'Frank' and\u2014bam\u2014the audio suddenly skips ahead. It's chilling. It's clearly deliberate. No question about it. It's clear concealment.\"\n\nCliff Kincaid, Director of the AIM Center for Investigative Journalism, can be contacted at [email protected] org.",
    " Title: Italy Implements Nationwide Lockdown as Coronavirus Death Toll Surges\n\nArticle:\n\nItaly has extended its emergency measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak, imposing travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings across the entire country. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the new measures on Monday, urging citizens to stay home and seek permission for essential travel.\n\nIn a televised address, Conte stated, \"There is no more time.\" The death toll from the virus in Italy jumped from 366 to 463 on Monday, making it the worst-affected country outside of China. The number of confirmed cases also increased by 24% from Sunday, according to official figures. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions.\n\nConte said, \"The whole of Italy will become a protected zone.\" He added, \"We all must give something up for the good of Italy. We have to do it now.\" The prime minister described the measures as \"I stay home,\" with people forbidden to gather in public. All sporting events, including football matches, are suspended nationwide, and schools and universities will remain closed until 3 April.\n\nOnly those with a valid work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed to travel. Passengers departing on flights will have to justify themselves, as will all those who arrive by plane. There are controls at train stations to check the temperatures of passengers, and cruise ships are also forbidden to dock at various ports.\n\nSeven inmates died amid riots at prisons across the country on Monday, after authorities suspended all visits as part of attempts to control the spread of the disease. The trouble began in the northern city of Modena at the Sant'Anna prison, where at least two of the dead are believed to have lost their lives to drug overdoses after raiding a prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone.\n\nThere were also riots at other prisons in northern Italy and at facilities in Naples and Rome. The number of infections worldwide is now over 111,000, with about 3,890 deaths.\n\nElsewhere, everyone arriving in Israel will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced. Iran has reported 43 new deaths related to the disease in the past 24 hours, with at least 237 people having died and 7,161 having been infected across the country since mid-February. Although the real figures are believed to be far higher.\n\nChina, which has recorded the highest number of fatalities, reported just 40 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest since 20 January. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the threat of a pandemic is \"very real.\" In Canada, the first death related to the virus has been confirmed, an elderly male patient in a care home in Vancouver, British Columbia. In France, Culture Minister Franck Riester has become the first member of the government to be infected with the virus. His team said he had spent several days of the past week in parliament, where a number of other cases have been confirmed.\n\nIn the US, the number of confirmed cases now exceeds 500. A cruise ship carrying thousands of people who were stranded for days due to a coronavirus outbreak has docked at the port of Oakland, near San Francisco.

    " Title: Trump Administration Unveils Modest but Significant Shift in U.S. Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the Trump administration unveiled an immigration plan aimed at reshaping the U.S. immigration system, prioritizing merit-based immigration and high-skilled labor over family-based immigration. The plan, while not comprehensive, represents a modest improvement over the administration's previous restrictive immigration policies.\n\nThe plan's central focus is a shift towards a \"merit\" system similar to those in place in Australia and Canada. The reform would increase skill-based immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, while decreasing family-based and lottery-based immigration by 50 percent. This change is expected to benefit employers in search of high-skilled workers, as the cap for H-1B visas (for temporary, skilled workers) and employment-based green cards has remained stagnant while the U.S. workforce has grown by 38 million since their inception.\n\nDuring his testimony before the House Committee on Small Business, my colleague Daniel Griswold advised members of Congress that increasing the number of high-skilled workers is crucial for serving the booming economy, particularly the tech and healthcare industries. Griswold suggests tripling the number of H-1B visas to 195,000 and doubling the 1990 cap of 140,000 for employment-based green cards.\n\nGriswold also recommends exempting spouses and minor children of primary green card workers from the cap to preserve family units without compromising the ability to attract more workers. Additionally, he suggests repealing the per-country quotas on green cards, which inadvertently discriminate against immigrants based on their country of origin.\n\nOne notable aspect of the Trump administration's plan is that it maintains current immigration levels, which may seem counterintuitive given the need for more immigrants. However, this approach is preferable to the administration's previous proposals to cut legal immigration in half.\n\nIt is perplexing that anyone would advocate for reducing overall levels of immigration, as economist and professor Julian Simon once asserted that people are the ultimate resource, and with more people come more brains and the promise of greater things to come. Furthermore, advocating for lower levels of immigration during an economic boom with the lowest unemployment rate in half a century is particularly puzzling.\n\nIn fact, a common complaint from the business community is the difficulty of finding enough employees, from high-skilled jobs in manufacturing to low-skilled positions in retail and the restaurant industries.\n\nWhile the plan has been praised for ending the discussion about scaling back legal immigration, it falls short in several areas. First, it fails to enhance legal immigration of low-skilled workers, despite numerous studies demonstrating the benefits of importing labor. This is due to the president's misguided belief that foreigners who come to the United States to work as housecleaners, gardeners, construction workers, kitchen helpers, and nannies are not beneficial for Americans and America.\n\nMoreover, the plan fails to streamline the guest-worker visa process and overlooks the importance of entrepreneurship, keeping out many less-skilled workers who start small businesses. The administration's proposal also fails to address the issue of \"Dreamers\" and the current illegal population, leaving them in limbo.\n\nWith the Democrats unwilling to consider any proposals from the administration, including this one, the plan is better understood as a political document than a serious legislative proposal. As such, it fails to be aspirational and implement a comprehensive and needed immigration plan. However, it should be commended for putting an end to the narrative about scaling back legal immigration.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey Suggests President Trump May Have Committed Indictable Offenses, Potential for Post-Presidency Investigation\n\nIn a CNN town-hall-style meeting, former FBI Director James Comey expressed his belief that President Donald Trump may have committed crimes that could lead to indictment once he leaves office. He stated that, were Trump not the president, he likely would already have been indicted.\n\nDuring the meeting, host Anderson Cooper asked Mr. Comey if he thought President Trump acted with corrupt intent to interfere with an ongoing investigation. Mr. Comey responded, \"It sure looks that way.\" He based this judgment on his reading of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, particularly President Trump's order to White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nWhen Cooper asked if Mr. Comey agreed with an open letter from numerous federal prosecutors that President Trump would already have been indicted on obstruction of justice charges if he were not the president, Mr. Comey was emphatic in his response.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr has stated that Mr. Mueller's decision not to charge President Trump was not solely based on the longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nMr. Comey suggested that Mr. Mueller, in writing his report, seemed to be balancing Justice Department policy with building a factual record that could be used in other circumstances, such as Congress's power to impeach a president.\n\nContrary to his statements Thursday that corrupt intent could be inferred about President Trump for his actions, Mr. Comey declined to bring charges against Hillary Clinton because, he said, such intent could not be proven.\n\nWhen asked whether President Trump could be indicted in 2021 or 2025 when he is no longer president, Mr. Comey said that was a possibility. \"The Justice Department will have to take a serious look at that,\" he said.\n\nMr. Comey also dismissed another defense of President Trump\u2014that the president, by definition, cannot obstruct justice by exercising his legitimate constitutional powers to run the executive branch. \"The president is not above the law,\" he said, calling the theory pushed by, among others, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz \"crazy and a recipe for lawlessness.\"",
    " Title: Trump Denies Briefing on Alleged Russian Bounties, Claims Intelligence Not Credible\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night tweet on Sunday, President Donald Trump claimed he was not briefed on intelligence about a Russian unit offering bounties on American service members in Afghanistan because the U.S. intelligence community deemed the information not credible. The President suggested that the details of the intelligence, first reported by The New York Times on Friday, may have been fabricated by the media to \"make Republicans look bad.\"\n\nTrump's tweet read, \"Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP. Possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax, maybe by the Fake News @nytimesbooks, wanting to make Republicans look bad!\"\n\nNeither the White House nor the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have directly addressed the credibility of the intelligence as described, but have disputed the Times' account that Trump was briefed on the information. Representatives for the ODNI and CIA did not immediately return requests for comment Monday about the president's claim that intelligence officials informed him the information was deemed not credible.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday that Congress would be briefed on the matter, without offering further details on who specifically would participate in the briefing. McEnany did not comment on the details of the intelligence but suggested that it had not been deemed \"verifiable and credible\" in denying that Trump had been briefed on the information.\n\n\"Intelligence, we don't comment on it routinely but just so you know how it works, it is vetted for its veracity and it only goes to the president and the high-level officials when it is deemed as verifiable and credible,\" McEnany said.\n\nTrump's tweet came shortly after The Washington Post reported that intelligence assessments concluded that the Russian payments offered to Taliban-linked militants led to the deaths of U.S. service members in Afghanistan. The Times reported Friday that the intelligence community concluded months ago that the Russian intelligence unit known as the GRU secretly offered payments to Taliban-linked militants for successful attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan last year.\n\nThe revelations have prompted criticism of Trump, who has been consistently scrutinized for his friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin and resistance to taking firm action against Moscow over its interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"His entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale,\" presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said during a virtual town hall on Saturday. \"It's betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm's way. It's a betrayal of every single American family with a loved one serving in Afghanistan or anywhere overseas.\"\n\nThe White House on Saturday denied that Trump or Vice President Pence was briefed on the intelligence but did not refute the accuracy of the intelligence as described by the Times and other news outlets.\n\n\"The United States receives thousands of intelligence reports a day and they are subject to strict scrutiny. While the White House does not routinely comment on alleged intelligence or internal deliberations, the CIA Director, National Security Advisor, and the Chief of Staff can all confirm that neither the President nor the Vice President were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence,\" McEnany said in a statement.\n\n\"This does not speak to the merit of the alleged intelligence but to the inaccuracy of the New York Times story erroneously suggesting that President Trump was briefed on this matter,\" McEnany continued.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who was recently installed in the top intelligence post by Trump, issued a statement backing the White House but did not comment on the substance of the intelligence reported by the Times.",
    " Title: President Trump Criticizes Washington State Judge Overturning Travel Ban, as Legal Battle Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, President Donald Trump continued his criticism of the Washington state judge who overturned his travel ban. The comments come as the U.S. Justice Department faced a setback in its attempt to reinstate the executive order, which restricts travel from seven Muslim-majority countries for at least 90 days, halts Syrian refugees indefinitely, and all refugees for 120 days.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\" He also wrote, \"Just can not believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James Robart ruled on Friday that the states of Washington and Minnesota, which filed the lawsuit, had \"met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order.\" Robart granted Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson's request for a temporary restraining order \"on a nationwide basis\" forbidding federal employees from enforcing Trump's order.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a strongly-worded response to Robart's decision, stating that halting the travel ban \"harms the public\" and \"second-guesses the President's national security judgment.\" The Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday that it would not continue to implement Trump's order, meaning business as usual at all airports. The State Department also said it would not cancel or revoke any more visas. Last week, up to 60,000 foreigners had their visas revoked.\n\n\"Those individuals with visas that were not physically cancelled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid,\" the State Department said. Robart noted that Trump's order is harmful to \"residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel.\"\n\nThe legal battle over the travel ban is ongoing, with the Justice Department expected to appeal Robart's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

However, this discourse, as it often unfolds, has been criticized for its one-sided nature and lack of self-reflection by some of its most ardent proponents.\n\nThe television pundits, including Chris Cuomo, have been quick to condemn the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun lobby groups for allegedly intimidating passive politicians. Yet, the same voices remain silent on the role of powerful teachers' unions in the decline of public education and the rise of school shootings.\n\nCuomo, known for his partisan rhetoric, criticized President Trump's tweets about the shooting, labeling them as \"stupid.\" Yet, it is unclear what Trump could have said to satisfy Cuomo, with some questioning if he was expecting Trump to call for the confiscation of all guns or the imposition of martial law.\n\nThe liberal elite's desired \"conversation\" about guns is not a genuine dialogue but an opportunity to diatribe without acknowledging their own role in the erosion of civil society. The rise of school shootings is not a result of the absence of laws but the absence of a civilized culture that taught students to respect rules.\n\nThe teachers' unions, cherished by the liberal elite, have been criticized for contributing significantly to the crisis in public education. Filled with self-interested hacks, these educrats have seen their pensions grow as schools have disintegrated. Before the rise of these unions, public schools didn't require \"gun-free zones\" and armed security forces. Teachers took the shaping of minds and souls seriously.\n\nThe liberal vision of gun control without self-control merely means a proliferation of laws that an increasingly depraved citizenry will not obey. The Florida shooter, who violated numerous laws, is a stark example of this. Adding a few more laws would not have prevented him.\n\nThe question then arises, where does the multiplication of laws end? It can only end in the destruction of a free society, where the final solution to crime is to treat everyone, both the virtuous and the vicious, as criminals. This is why the term \"conversation\" in this context gives off such an Orwellian chill. What are we supposed to be discussing? The transformation of our country into a totalitarian prison-state?\n\nIf freedom were the objective of the conversation, it would focus on the capacity of citizens to respect existing laws rather than the multiplication of restrictions. In other words, the conversation would turn to the repair of civilizing institutions, starting with the most fundamental school of virtue, the family. However, this is a conversation that gun-control advocates will never hold, as they have played a significant role in corrupting these institutions.\n\nThey don't want a free people. They want the prison-state, confident in the expectation that they will emerge as its wardens who can demand the confiscation of guns while standing behind their armed guards.",
    " Title: China and U.S. Agree in Principle to Roll Back Tariffs in \"Phase One\" Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry announced on Thursday that Beijing and Washington have reached a preliminary agreement to roll back existing tariffs in phases as trade negotiations progress. Ministry spokesman Gao Feng stated that both sides have agreed to simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other's goods, according to CNBC, citing the Chinese state broadcaster.\n\nGao noted that both sides are closer to a so-called \"phase one\" trade agreement following constructive negotiations over the past two weeks. If a \"Phase 1\" agreement is reached, tariffs already increased would be canceled at the same time and by the same rate, Gao said at a news briefing. The size of the reductions would depend on the agreement's content.\n\nGao emphasized that a limited trade agreement requires the U.S. and China to remove the same amount of charges at the same time, according to the report. The news of a \"phase one\" trade agreement prompted US stock index futures to rally Thursday morning, with Dow futures poised to open more than 120 points.\n\nThe two governments have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods in a dispute over China's trade surplus and technology ambitions. These tariffs have weighed on trade and threatened to depress global economic growth, which already shows signs of slowing.\n\nPresident Trump, who agreed to postpone a planned tariff hike while lower-level officials hammered out details, said China had agreed to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. The Oct. 12 agreement helped ease market jitters, but the two sides have yet to announce progress on major disagreements over technology and other irritants following 13 rounds of talks.\n\nTrump and President Xi Jinping were due to meet at this month's gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, but that event was canceled due to protests there. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross this week said any \"Phase 1\" agreement would be general and cover trade in specific areas such as soybeans and liquefied natural gas. More complex issues would be tackled in later negotiations, he said.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes Marines' Discriminatory Page, Sparking Calls for Action Against Military Sexual Harassment\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Facebook page that allegedly denigrated women in the Marine Corps has been removed after a House member complained to the Pentagon, citing it as another example of the military's lax attitude toward sexual harassment.\n\nRep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) brought the page to the attention of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and top military brass in a letter released Wednesday. She also addressed the issue to Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos, asking officials to outline their response plan.\n\nThe Marine Corps, in a statement released Wednesday by Capt. Eric Flanagan, said, \"Marines are responsible for all content they publish on social networking sites, blogs, or other websites. There is no tolerance for discriminatory comments. It goes against good order and discipline.\"\n\nSpeier stated, \"I almost expect to see this trash. The military is not policing itself.\"\n\nThe creator or maintainers of the page remain unknown. In later online posts, Speier was incorrectly called a senator and threatened for causing the page to be taken down. Speier's office said the posts were referred to the U.S. Capitol Police, who declined to comment Wednesday night.\n\nSpeier wrote, \"I am confident that if you reviewed the contents of this webpage that you would be horrified by the culture of misogyny and sexual harassment depicted on the web site.\"\n\nThe Marines' statement said that \"based on complaints that have been received, both active duty and reserve Marines have been involved; all instances are referred to commands for appropriate action.\"\n\nFacebook removed the page Wednesday after determining the administrators were fake, said a company official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook routinely removes pages that bully or harass people in general.\n\nSpeier wrote that the page and others like it \"contribute to a culture that permits and seems to encourage sexual assault and abuse.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps inspector general is aware of the site and has been monitoring it for three years, according to Speier's letter. The Marine Corps statement said the inspector general has \"been dealing with complaints about social media over the past 10 years\" but did not specifically answer questions about the site removed Wednesday.\n\nSpeier wrote that despite the monitoring, cyber retaliation against those who complain about the website's content continues unabated.\n\nThe Marines' statement said officials have \"notified social media sites on several occasions\" of offensive content, but \"there are difficulties in identifying the individuals responsible for the offensive material due to fake accounts and pseudonyms. Social media sites are not obligated to divulge personal information to the Marine Corps.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon released a report estimating 26,000 troops had been sexually abused in 2012, up 35% since the last survey in 2010.\n\nLater Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) sent letters to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee asking them to add anti-sexual assault provisions to the 2014 defense authorization bill, which is currently being developed.\n\n\"As you prepare the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, I strongly urge you to include additional legislation to ensure justice for victims of sexual assault in the military and to prevent these horrific acts against service members in the future,\" Reid wrote Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).\n\n\"Specifically, I urge you to eliminate the ability of military commanders to arbitrarily reverse convictions under the Uniform Code for Military Justice for sexual assault,\" Reid wrote. \"This authority, which can currently be exercised without any stated reason or regard for the merits of a case, can not continue to be an impediment to accountability and justice.\"\n\nOn Thursday, key White House aides are scheduled to meet with a bipartisan group of about 12 members of the House and Senate to discuss potential legislation to address the issue.",
    " Title: Media Controversy Erupts Over Donald Trump's Response to Khizr Khan's Speech at the Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest media controversy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has found himself under scrutiny for his reaction to the emotional speech delivered by Khizr Khan, the bereaved father of Captain Humayun Khan, an immigrant soldier who died in Iraq in 2004.\n\nKhan's speech, delivered at the Democratic National Convention, was a powerful rebuke, though factually incorrect in certain aspects, such as the Constitution's prohibition of religious tests for immigrants. The media has since used the speech to attack Trump.\n\nIn interviews with Maureen Dowd of the New York Times and George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Trump was asked to respond to the speech. In both instances, Trump referred to Khan's wife, Khadija, saying he would like to hear her speak, a comment that has been criticized as insensitive.\n\nTrump also suggested that Khan's father, Khizr Khan, had been scripted by the Clinton campaign, a charge the family later denied on MSNBC. Trump returned to his policy argument, stating, \"We've had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism, that's what I'd say.\"\n\nThe media's response was swift and critical, with Ezra Klein of Vox.com labeling Trump's comments as \"horrifying, even for Trump.\" However, it is worth noting that when Benghazi mother Patricia Smith spoke at the Republican convention the week before, Vox.com writers described her speech as an example of \"extreme overreach\" and \"a scary appeal to the GOP base.\"\n\nOther media outlets reacted similarly, with PolitiFact fact-checking Smith's claims, despite her story being corroborated by other bereaved Benghazi parents.\n\nWhile Trump's response could be seen as less than gracious, it is worth considering that Hillary Clinton, whose negligence contributed to Sean Smith's death, essentially called Patricia Smith a liar on national television, and few in the media objected. Some even joined Clinton's attack.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Khan's father has since stated that terror has \"nothing to do with Islam.\" Meanwhile, Trump has issued statements via Twitter and his campaign website, defending his stance on radical Islamic terrorism and criticizing Clinton's role in foreign policy.\n\nJoel B.

Rand Paul Criticizes President Obama's Border Policy During Guatemalan Visit, Accused of Political Stunt by Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a humanitarian trip to Guatemala to perform pro-bono eye surgeries, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized President Barack Obama's border policy and called for the Senate to vote on the House-passed immigration reform bill.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina on Wednesday, Mr. Paul stated that the main issue behind the ongoing border crisis lies with the White House.\n\n\"I told him frankly that I didn't think the problem was in Guatemala City, but that the problem was in the White House in our country, and that the mess we've got at the border is frankly because of the White House's policies,\" Mr. Paul said in an interview with Breitbart.com.\n\nMr. Paul expressed support for the House bill to end Mr. Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and stated that the legislation would \"go a long way to fixing the problem.\"\n\n\"But like everything else, nothing good has happened because Sen. [Harry] Reid has decided that he's not going to allow any votes on any bills this year because he's protecting his members who are vulnerable in the election \u2014 he's protecting them from any kinds of votes,\" Mr. Paul said.\n\nThe potential 2016 GOP presidential nominee criticized Mr. Obama for not doing enough to secure the border and stated that without a real solution at the border, there can be no reform.\n\n\"It comes from the president basically offering unilaterally, without congressional approval, beacons or magnets without securing the border,\" Mr. Paul told Breitbart.com. \"He seems to be doing this again because he doesn't have what it takes to get Congress to pass legislation.\"\n\nMr. Paul, a former ophthalmologist, has been performing sight-restoring eye surgeries in the rural Guatemalan town of Salama over the past week.\n\nDemocrats responded to Mr. Paul's comments, calling his trip a political stunt.\n\n\"While everyone should commend Paul for his aid work, it's unfortunate he turned a trip organized by a well-respected eye center into a crass campaign photo op,\" Michael Czin, national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, wrote in a memo.\n\nMr. Czin accused Mr. Paul of condemning the president in the presence of a foreign leader and stated, \"Regardless of political party, we do not go abroad and slam our own because of policy differences. We are better than that.\"\n\nIn the memo, Mr. Czin pointed out that Mr. Paul voted against Democratic immigration reform legislation and opposed an emergency supplemental package to address the border crisis.\n\n\"America deserves better from our elected officials \u2014 especially those who want to seek the highest office in the land,\" Mr. Czin wrote.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests \"Rogue Killers\" in Khashoggi Disappearance as Saudi Arabia Grants Consulate Search\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Donald Trump suggested on Monday that \"rogue killers\" could be behind the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, following a phone call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman about the case.\n\nAccording to White House reporters, Salman offered Trump a \"flat denial\" in relation to Khashoggi's disappearance, a columnist for The Washington Post who was last seen in public when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on October 2.\n\nLater on Monday, the Saudis were reportedly preparing to admit that Khashoggi died during an interrogation that went wrong, intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey, according to two sources.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo left Washington for Riyadh at around midday to meet with the Saudi King on Trump's orders. Previously, Saudi authorities had maintained that Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but have provided no evidence to support the claim. Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate, says she did not see him re-emerge.\n\nTrump stated, \"It was not like there was a question in his mind. The denial was very strong,\" referring to King Salman's denial. \"He did not really know -- maybe -- I do not want to get into his mind but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers, who knows?\" Trump added.\n\nPompeo's meeting with the Saudi King is expected to provide further clarity on the situation. \"We are going to try to get to the bottom of it very soon,\" Trump said. \"But his was a flat denial.\"\n\nTurkish investigators, including forensics officers, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Monday evening, after being granted permission by Saudi officials. Turkish officials also want to search the nearby consul general's residence.\n\nTurkish authorities believe 15 Saudi men who arrived in Istanbul on October 2 were connected to Khashoggi's disappearance and possible murder. At least some of them appear to have high-level connections in the Saudi government.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN on Friday that Turkish authorities have audio and visual evidence that shows journalist Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate.\n\nInternational pressure is mounting on Riyadh to explain the journalist's disappearance, in a case that has created a diplomatic rift between Saudi Arabia and the West. The UK, France, and Germany have demanded a \"credible investigation\" into the events, and Trump on Sunday warned of serious retribution if the Saudis were found to be behind his possible death.\n\nSaudi officials threatened to retaliate if the US imposed sanctions, but Riyadh later softened its tone. The case has also caused friction between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which has repeatedly accused the Saudis of failing to cooperate with their investigation.\n\nAmid the diplomatic fallout, international firms are pulling out of a high-profile investment summit. The Future Investment Initiative conference, dubbed \"Davos in the Desert,\" was due to take place later this month in Riyadh, hosted by Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe latest high-profile invitee to pull out of the conference is World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, according to a person familiar with the decision. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has also withdrawn, a spokesperson confirmed Sunday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was still due to attend the conference. Trump said on Monday that Mnuchin has until Friday to decide whether to attend. \"He's going to make that decision,\" Trump said.\n\nThe attendance of British Trade Secretary Liam Fox was in doubt, according to the BBC. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considered delaying the Saudi investment conference until after the investigation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. It is unclear if that is still under consideration, according to the source. CNN received no response when reaching out to the CEO, managing director, and organizers of the conference.\n\nSaudi Arabia has found support in a number of Arab allies, including Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, which all put out statements Sunday saying they expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia. The Palestinian Authority also put out a statement of support.",
    " Title: President Trump Faces Pressure to Remain Cautious Amidst Russia Investigation Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Oval Office, President Donald Trump finds himself in a precarious position following the unveiling of indictments and plea deals in the ongoing Russia investigation. The indictment of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, along with the plea agreement with former Trump foreign-policy adviser George Papadopoulos, has sparked a wave of negative press coverage that could potentially provoke the President's notorious impulsive reactions.\n\nThe indictment of Manafort, who allegedly engaged in shady lobbying activities, is not directly linked to the Trump campaign. The charges against him, which date back to 2006, involve failure to register as a foreign lobbyist and alleged money laundering. If Manafort is innocent, he is a lobbyist who barely complied with the law; if he is guilty, he is a lobbyist who also committed crimes.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos' plea for lying to the FBI, on the other hand, involves his work for the campaign. He misled investigators about the timing and nature of his contacts with Russians who proposed a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, and discussed dirt on Hillary Clinton. However, Papadopoulos was a minor player, and it is unclear if the talks progressed.\n\nIf President Trump were to react to these developments by firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller or issuing pre-emptive pardons, he would escalate a matter that is currently on the periphery of his world into a full-blown crisis. Such actions could potentially endanger his presidency, as all the special counsel's materials would be handed over to Congress, and Mueller would likely become a key witness in impeachment hearings.\n\nIn the past, Trump's impulsive actions, such as his ousting of James Comey, have led to negative consequences. If Trump wants to avoid repeating such mistakes, he should refrain from firing Mueller or issuing a barrage of pardons. Instead, he should maintain a cautious approach and allow the investigation to run its course.",
    " Title: Brexit Transition Period: A Tightrope Walk Towards Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the U.K. officially leaves the European Union on January 31, 2020, the country embarks on a delicate 11-month transition period, during which it will be treated as if it were still part of the EU. This agreement, a result of the Brexit process, aims to provide a smooth transition for both parties, but the road ahead is fraught with challenges.\n\nThe transition period is a testament to the complexities of the EU relationship, a reality that Brexit supporters may have underestimated. The period since the 2016 referendum has been marked by political upheaval, with the careers of two prime ministers, eight cabinet ministers, and over 80 MPs ending prematurely. The U.K.'s future partnership with the EU must be negotiated by the end of the year, or risk a no-deal scenario, which could lead to significant disruptions, particularly in food and other goods due to potential tariffs and customs checks.\n\nThe U.K. must now negotiate a trade deal governing future commercial relations with Europe, a task that, given the EU's recent trade deals with Canada and Japan took seven years to complete, presents a challenging deadline. Prime Minister Johnson has repeatedly ruled out extending the transition date, setting the stage for two potential outcomes: a narrow trade deal that excludes services, the bulk of the British economy, or a no-deal exit.\n\nThe Brexit process has also highlighted deep-seated societal issues within the U.K., with the liberal status quo being criticized for entrenched asymmetries of power and inequalities of wealth. The imperative to patiently listen to opposing viewpoints is increasingly unrealistic, given the widening gap between the haves and have-nots.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and Iran stand on the brink of conflict, with President Trump's declaration of a red line in response to the assassination of Iran's top military commander. The risk of violent conflict increases as Iran relies on a network of proxy actors, some of which may not respect Trump's red line. It is crucial that influential Republican senators remind Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent further escalation.\n\nAs the U.K. navigates its post-Brexit future and the U.S. grapples with geopolitical tensions, the choices stemming from these events are arguably more significant than the choices that led to them. The stakes are high, and the potential for disruption is real. The U.K.'s interest in the Brexit process must remain steadfast, lest the real decisions be made in a time of political boredom and apathy.",
    " Title: Obamacare Premiums Surge in 2017: A Look at the Impact and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially reshape the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) landscape, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Monday that premiums for the most popular benchmark plans will increase an average of 22 percent in 2017. This surge in premiums comes as the law continues to rely on older, sicker customers than initially anticipated, and as the number of insurers offering plans on the federally run exchange is set to plummet.\n\nThe decline in participating insurers, with major players such as UnitedHealth Group and Aetna withdrawing from most states and nearly all of Obamacare's co-op plans failing, has raised concerns about lower competition and potential further premium increases. Roughly one in five customers will have only a single insurer as an option next year, according to HHS.\n\nThe premium increases are particularly challenging for President Barack Obama, who is in his final months in office, and for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee who has defended the law. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, stated, \"This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans, who are struggling to maintain their majorities in both chambers, have also seized on the news, warning voters that electing Democrats could cement the Affordable Care Act into law. Obamacare customers, who are also voters, can get a first look at their own rates when they log onto the federal HealthCare.gov website during the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1.\n\nAccording to HHS, 80 percent of customers will not feel the full impact of the premium increases due to taxpayer-funded subsidies. Nearly three-quarters of customers in 2017 will be able to find a plan for $75 or less per month after tax credits kick in. However, several million customers who do not qualify for government subsidies or purchase insurance off the exchanges will feel the full brunt of the increases.\n\nTaxpayers will also have to shoulder more of the cost to cover the subsidies for those who do qualify, meaning Obamacare's costs will continue to rise. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to detail the extent of this burden on taxpayers.\n\nAnalysts have warned for months that massive premium increases were likely due to the Obamacare program's ongoing struggle to attract healthy customers, who are needed to make the economics work. Premium increases will vary widely from place to place, with some of the figures being eye-popping. For instance, in Arizona, a 27-year-old's average monthly premium for the second-lowest silver plan jumps $196 to $422, a 116 percent increase, before subsidies.\n\nThe administration has stated that things could worsen if federal courts do not overturn a May decision that sided with House Republicans, who argue that the Treasury is unlawfully reimbursing insurers for losses under the 2010 health care overhaul. In court papers on Monday, the Justice Department argued that Republicans should not have been allowed to sue over the cost-sharing program, which is designed to pay back insurers who must help poorer enrollees with out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nDespite the headwinds, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is predicting that the marketplace will expand by roughly 1 million customers in 2017 as insurers bring their prices in line with actual costs. She estimated that 13.8 million people will buy plans during open enrollment on the exchanges, compared with 12.7 million who initially signed up for 2016. This is still short of the 15 million that congressional scorekeepers predicted just a few months ago.\n\nEven President Obama has acknowledged that his law will need changes after he is out of office, including a government-run plan, or \"public option,\" to bolster competition in the exchanges. As it stands, the number of insurers participating on HealthCare.gov has dwindled from 232 this year to 167 in 2017. Customers on HealthCare.gov, which serves 39 states, will still be able to choose, on average, from 30 plans with different combinations of premiums, out-of-pocket costs, networks of hospitals and physicians, and prescription drug coverage options.",
    " Title: Democratic-Republican Tensions Escalate as Attorney General Barr Refuses to Testify Before House Judiciary Committee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has further escalated the ongoing tensions between the Democratic-controlled House and the Trump administration, Attorney General William Barr declined to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The refusal, according to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), has led to a \"near unanimous sense in the Democratic Caucus that the executive branch of government is in defiance of the Constitution and the rule of law.\"\n\nRaskin, a former constitutional law professor who sits on both the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, stated, \"He [Barr] does not dictate to us how we conduct hearings in Congress.\" The Trump administration has been under steady attack from Democrats in both the House and Senate, with Barr being a primary target.\n\nThe White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, called the Democrats' request for staff lawyers to question Barr a \"pathetic\" moment for the committee. \"We lost confidence in Jerry Nadler a long time ago, but it's surprising to find out he's lost confidence in himself,\" Sanders said.\n\nIn response, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has stated that Democrats will make one more \"good faith attempt\" to negotiate with Barr and obtain the unredacted Mueller report. If they do not receive it, Nadler has threatened to hold Barr in contempt and pursue further legal action.\n\nOn Friday, Nadler followed through on his promise, sending a letter to Barr requesting the unredacted Mueller report by May 6. If Barr does not comply, Nadler has stated that Barr will face contempt proceedings and further legal action.\n\nIn his letter, Nadler wrote, \"Congress's constitutional, oversight and legislative interest in investigating misconduct by the president and his associates can not be disputed.\" He also reminded Barr that the department has repeatedly asserted that Congress's requests do not serve \"legitimate\" purposes, a claim that Nadler disputes.\n\nDemocrats are currently considering various options, including impeachment, censure, and invoking Congress's \"inherent contempt\" powers, which have not been triggered in nearly a century. Speaker Pelosi, who has previously downplayed impeachment talk, reminded reporters on Thursday that ignoring Congress had consequences for another president, referring to the Articles of Impeachment for President Nixon, which included Article 3, stating that he ignored the subpoenas of Congress.\n\nThe tensions between the two parties are not limited to Barr's testimony. Democrats are also seeking to hear from former White House Counsel Don McGahn, but President Trump has indicated that he will invoke executive privilege to block any request.\n\nIn a theatrical move, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) brought a bucket of KFC to the empty hearing room on Thursday to make a point. \"Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions,\" Cohen said, perhaps sending a message to the administration about what happens when you ignore Congress.\n\nAs the standoff continues, some Democrats, like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who sits on the Judiciary panel, have stated that they are no longer interested in hearing from Barr. \"At this point, I do not believe anything Barr says. So I'd rather have Mueller,\" Jayapal told NPR.\n\nNadler has invited Robert Mueller to testify on May 15, and Barr has stated publicly that he has no objection to this. As the anticipated clash between Democrats and the Trump administration continues, it remains to be seen how this latest development will unfold.",
    " Title: Yahoo News Retains Katie Couric Amidst Allegations of Deceptive Editing in Documentaries\n\nIn a statement to a media outlet, a Yahoo spokesperson confirmed that the news organization will continue to employ Katie Couric as its global anchor, despite recent allegations of deceptive editing in documentaries she executive produced and narrated. The spokesperson emphasized that Yahoo was not involved in the creation and production of the independent documentaries, Under the Gun and Fed Up.\n\nThe statement comes as Couric faces scrutiny over edits made in the two documentaries since joining Yahoo News in 2013 for a reported $10 million a year. In the 2016 documentary Under the Gun, Couric and director Stephanie Soechtig edited out gun rights activists\u2019 answers to a question about background checks, replacing them with several seconds of silence. This led to calls for Couric's dismissal following a Free Beacon report that revealed raw audio of the interview.\n\nFurther accusations of deceptive editing were made in the 2014 documentary film Fed Up, also executive produced by Couric and directed by Soechtig. Dr. David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, stated that his portrayal in that film was \"antithetical to the spirit of science and democratic dialogue.\" Industry sources told the Free Beacon that the documentary inserted audio at a moment it did not occur during a separate interview with Lisa Gable, a spokesperson for the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation.\n\nThe Weinstein Company, which distributes Fed Up, manually requested the removal of YouTube videos from Fed Up at the center of the Free Beacon report hours after publication. Soechtig, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the Free Beacon, did not dispute the accusations of deceptive editing but stood by the film in a statement to Variety.\n\nSoechtig's statement emphasized the impact of Fed Up, stating that the film has inspired substantial conversations about the issues it addresses. She also highlighted the recent FDA announcement to start labeling added sugar on nutrition labels, a solution specifically highlighted in the film.\n\nA spokesperson for Couric did not issue a statement to Variety but directed the publication to Soechtig's statement. The controversy surrounding Couric's documentaries continues to unfold, with industry professionals and media outlets scrutinizing the editing practices employed in these productions.",
    " Title: Egypt Declares State of Emergency Following Deadly Church Bombings Claimed by ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi declared a three-month state of emergency on Sunday, following two deadly suicide bombings at Coptic Christian churches in the cities of Tanta and Alexandria. The attacks, claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS) terror group, left at least 44 people dead and over 100 injured.\n\nThe first explosion occurred at St. George Church in Tanta, where at least 27 people were killed and 78 others wounded, according to officials.

The attack came just after Pope Tawadros II, leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, finished services, but his aides told local media that he was unharmed. At least three police officers were killed in the St. Mark's attack, the ministry told The Associated Press.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks via its Aamaq media agency, following the group's recent video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, who the group describes as \"infidels\" empowering the West against Muslims.\n\nThe blasts occurred at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country.\n\nEl-Sisi accused unnamed countries of fueling instability in the country, adding \"Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.\" El-Sisi ordered the immediate deployment of troops to assist police in protecting vital facilities across the country.\n\nEl-Sisi did not immediately detail the legal measures needed to declare the state of emergency, but according to the Egyptian constitution, the parliament majority must vote in favor of the state of emergency.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that el-Sissi, \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3.\n\nThe State Department issued its own statement condemning the attacks, which it called \"barbaric.\"\n\n\"The United States will continue to support Egypt's security and stability in its efforts to defeat terrorism,\" the statement said.\n\nThe attack in Tanta was the latest in a series of assaults on Egypt's Christian minority, which makes up around 10 percent of the population and has been repeatedly targeted by Islamic extremists.\n\nGrand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar \u2013 the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam \u2013 condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\"\n\nAcross the street from St. George, neighbor Susan Mikhail, whose apartment has a clear balcony view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building midmorning, at a time when the church was packed.\n\n\"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told The Associated Press. Later, the more seriously wounded started to come out, carried in the arms of survivors and ferried to hospitals in private cars, she said.\n\nPope Francis decried the bombings, expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\"\n\nBoth Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza also condemned the bombings.\n\nPresidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted his condolences and said, \"We strongly condemn the heinous terror attacks on churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday today.\"\n\nMehmet Gormez, the head of religious affairs in Turkey, \"cursed\" the attacks and said they are the shared problem of all humanity.\n\n\"The immunity of a place of worship, no matter the religion it belongs to, can not be violated and the bloodthirsty killing of innocent worshippers can not ever be forgiven,\" Gormez said in an official statement.\n\nTurkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also published a statement denouncing the attack on St. George Church.\n\n\"We convey our condolences to the bereaved families and the whole people of Egypt,\" the statement said before a second attack hit an Alexandria church.\n\nThe bombings add to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians.\n\nA local Islamic State affiliate claimed a suicide bombing at a church in Cairo in December that killed around 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the restive Sinai Peninsula that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country. The group has threatened further attacks.\n\nA militant group called Liwa al-Thawra claimed responsibility for an April 1 bomb attack targeting a police training center in Tanta, which wounded 16 people. The group, believed to be linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, has mainly targeted security forces and distanced itself from attacks on Christians.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Decision on DACA as White House Prepares to Announce Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the White House prepares to announce its decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, President Donald J. Trump faces a contentious issue that has divided his administration since his campaign days. The White House is set to issue a decision on DACA's future on Tuesday.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump had pledged to eliminate DACA on his first day in office. However, after assuming the presidency, Trump has been unable to follow through on this promise. In February, Trump confessed to reporters that the DACA situation was \"very difficult\" for him, stating, \"I love these kids... I find it very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.\"\n\nWhile candidate Trump advocated for tough enforcement of federal immigration law, President Trump appears to have been moved by the same sentiments that prompted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to argue against rescinding a program that has allowed some 750,000 undocumented immigrants to remain in the country legally and apply for work permits.\n\nIn a statement, Hatch said, \"We also need a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here.\"\n\nA group of pro-enforcement state attorneys general has reportedly prodded Trump to make a decision, rather than allowing the program to continue indefinitely. In 2014, these attorneys general sued to stop the expansion of DACA and another Obama mandate, Deferred Action for American Parents, which provided legal status for 5 million undocumented immigrants who are related to DACA recipients.\n\nIf Trump rescinds DACA, those who applied for temporary legal status may feel more vulnerable, as they would have registered with the federal government. Organizations advocating for undocumented immigrants, as well as leaders in tech and big business, have expressed concern over the potential consequences of rescinding DACA.\n\nMark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies noted that the DREAM Act offered protections for \"genuinely sympathetic cases of people who came as infants and toddlers.\" However, he added, \"the DREAM Act itself was never intended to pass on its own \u2014 it was a marketing gimmick to make the case for amnestying all 12 million illegals.\"\n\nAs the White House prepares to announce its decision on DACA, it remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his campaign promise or reach across the aisle to find a compromise that protects DACA recipients while also addressing concerns about immigration enforcement.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Indicates Coronavirus Likely Occurred Naturally, but Origins Remain Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence suggests that the coronavirus likely originated naturally, rather than being engineered in a Chinese laboratory, but there is no definitive proof either way, the top U.S. general said on Tuesday. Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made these remarks during a Pentagon news briefing, potentially reigniting speculation about the virus' origins, a topic that China has dismissed as a baseless conspiracy theory.\n\nWhen asked if there was any evidence that the virus emerged from a Chinese laboratory and was possibly leaked, Milley remained non-committal. \"There's a lot of rumor and speculation in various media, blog sites, etc. It should be no surprise to you that we've taken a keen interest in that, and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,\" Milley said.\n\n\"And I would just say, at this point, it's inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain,\" he added.\n\nMilley's comments could further escalate tensions with Beijing, where Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian wrote on Twitter last month that the U.S. Army might have \"brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\" This claim was denounced by the U.S. government and caused frustration for U.S. President Donald Trump, who referred to the coronavirus as \"the Chinese virus\" in briefings. The State Department stated at the time that China was attempting to divert attention from its role in \"starting a global pandemic and not informing the world.\"\n\nAs far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology refuted rumors that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its laboratories or possibly escaped from there.\n\nThe broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2, the virus' official name, originated in bats. A Washington Post opinion column published on Tuesday revealed that the U.S. State Department warned in diplomatic cables about safety and management weaknesses at a WIV laboratory in 2018.\n\nThe Post also noted that scientists generally agree that the virus came from animals, as opposed to being synthesized. However, one expert quoted in the article did not rule out the possibility that it may have emerged from the WIV laboratory, which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to directly address the Washington Post column in interviews on Tuesday. \"We know this is a global pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. We know that there were wet markets there. So we're beginning to piece the facts together,\" Pompeo said in a radio interview.\n\nA team of 27 scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal in February, condemning conspiracy theories, which \"do nothing but create fear, rumors, and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.\" They stated that scientists from around the world \"overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.\"",
    " Title: Democrats' Use of Campaign Tracker Videos Sparks Privacy Concerns Among Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised questions about the boundaries of political privacy, House Democrats are employing a new tactic in their campaign strategies: recording and posting online videos of the homes of GOP congressmen and candidates. This practice, which has been described as a ratcheting up of the video surveillance game, has unnerved Republicans who view it as a gross invasion of privacy and a potential safety risk.\n\nWhile campaign tracking, where staffers record public appearances and statements of opponents, is a common practice in serious campaigns, the Democratic approach seems to push the boundaries. The raw footage, posted on the internet, captures the homes of GOP politicians from various angles, sometimes even including their addresses.\n\nRepublicans argue that this practice, despite the political nature of their work, crosses a line. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Reid Ribble, who has also been followed by a cameraman during a grocery shopping trip, expressed his disapproval, stating, \"I feel it's totally inappropriate. It was disturbing to me that they would put that online. I don't understand any political benefit that can be achieved with that.\"\n\nIn Ribble's case, a 38-second video of his northeastern Wisconsin home was posted online on June 18. The soundless video, taken from a car parked outside the house, provides several views of the large home.\n\nDeaNa Ribble, the congressman's wife, found the video deeply unsettling. \"I'm more creeped out about this than Reid is, just because I'm home more,\" she said. \"If they so much as put a foot on private property, I will be the first person to call the police.\"\n\nRepublicans who have had their homes videotaped understand the competitive nature of politics and accept that their public utterances are fair game. However, they argue that filming a home and posting addresses should be off-limits, out of respect for their families and neighbors.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Renacci, who was informed by a neighbor about a tracker crouching in the bushes to take footage of his home, echoed this sentiment. \"I think your family or your personal life should be off-limits unless it enters the campaign,\" he said. \"It's hard for my neighbors or my family to get comfortable when someone is in the bushes.\"\n\nThis development in campaign tactics has sparked a debate about the acceptable limits of political privacy and the potential impact on the safety of politicians and their families. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the line between campaigning and personal privacy remains a contentious issue.",
    " Title: Inspector General's Report: Trump Administration Illegally Tried to Enforce Original Travel Ban, According to New Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new memo to Congress, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, John Roth, has accused the Trump administration of illegally attempting to enforce the original travel ban, issued on January 27, 2017. The memo, released to Democratic members of Congress on Monday, also alleges that the administration tried to use legal tactics to conceal the illegal behavior from the public.\n\nAccording to the report, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Homeland Security agency responsible for screening arrivals, was left without guidance on the travel ban, leading to a lack of leadership during its implementation. CBP also defied two court orders by issuing \"no board\" instructions to airlines, even after courts had halted the travel ban policy.\n\nThe report concludes that passengers who reached the U.S. during this period were treated well by CBP officers, contradicting some reports of abuse and children being handcuffed. However, the inspector general could not substantiate these reports. In fact, the report states that many CBP officers went the extra mile, providing water and food from their own personal funds.\n\nThe administration also made wide use of waivers, allowing most passengers who reached the U.S. in spite of the executive order. This suggests that the original travel ban was more of a rhetorical measure than an effective one when it was being carried out.\n\nThe original order was blocked by several courts, and the revised order issued in March was also blocked by lower courts. However, the Supreme Court partially overruled them in June, allowing some of the ban to take effect. The third version of the policy, issued this fall, is currently under court scrutiny.\n\nThe inspector general's findings cover the period from January 27, 2017, when the policy was implemented, until it was fully halted by a judge in Seattle on February 3, 2017. The report was submitted to the Homeland Security Department on October 6, but the department is yet to decide whether to classify any part of the report as secret.\n\nDemocrats who released the memo on Monday criticized the department for potentially hiding the findings, with Sens. Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth stating, \"The rule of law and our constitutional protections mean little if law enforcement is empowered by the president to disregard them.\"\n\nIn response, Tyler Houlton, spokesman for Homeland Security, didn't directly address the findings of illegal behavior, but insisted that officers \"conducted themselves professionally, and in a legal manner.\" He also defended the attempt to shield the report's contents, stating that the ability to claim those privileges is \"well-recognized law.\"",
    " Title: \"Trump's Debate Preparation: A Mountain Too High to Climb?\"\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael D'Antonio, author of the new book \"The Truth About Trump,\" offers a critical analysis of Donald Trump's approach to the upcoming presidential debates. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n( CNN ) As the dust settles from the first presidential debate, Donald Trump faces a daunting task: overcoming his defeat and preparing for the next. Instead of focusing on self-improvement, Trump has been criticized for his whining about the moderator, the microphone, and his opponent, while continuing to draw attention to the worst parts of his performance.\n\nAdvisors who want Trump to win the next debate, scheduled for October 9, must help him change his ways. However, overcoming the candidate's 40-plus years of doing things his way is a formidable challenge. To appreciate the magnitude of this task, consider just 10 things Trump could do to prepare for the next debate, and why it's unlikely he will be able to do any of them.\n\nTrump's poor sportsmanship since his loss to Hillary Clinton is a concern for his advisors. Ignoring real poll results that show he was swamped, Trump has ordered aides to stop saying he lost. This denial means that no one can ask the candidate to address his shortcomings, as he refuses to acknowledge his own \"nakedness.\"\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Trump's first debate performance was his lack of accountability. When asked about his role in the \"birther\" controversy, Trump replied, \"I say nothing.\" Trump has never taken responsibility for the damage he has caused to individuals, communities, or nations, and it is unlikely he will learn to do so now.\n\nManners matter in a two-way presidential debate, but Trump's childish behavior, such as interrupting with witticisms like \"Wrong!\" as Clinton spoke, is unlikely to change. Trump told D'Antonio that he believes he is the same person he was in first grade, and his advisers are not likely to help him mature into an adult.\n\nTrump's cringe-worthy moments, such as boasting about not paying taxes and betting on a housing crisis, are essential elements of his personality and will not stop. Body language experts noted Trump's negative body language and timid facial expression during the first debate, and it is unlikely he will be able to control his exaggerated nonverbals.\n\nTrump's lack of preparation was evident during the first debate, as he seemed ill-equipped with arguments or rhetorical parries to use against his opponent. Trump told D'Antonio that he does not like to read and prefers to depend on instinct, making it difficult to imagine he will suddenly become open to training.\n\nTrump's reference to General Douglas MacArthur during the first debate, a historical figure who died in 1964, was a missed opportunity to connect with millions of viewers who may not have been familiar with the general. Trump must update his knowledge base, but given the evidence that he does not understand the workings of our most vital technology, the internet, modernizing his knowledge base would be a big challenge.\n\nTrump's stance on Russia, consistent with his earlier sloughing off of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine and his expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to change. Because everything is personal for Trump, he is unlikely to change his mind about the Russians on the basis of geopolitics.\n\nTrump's penchant for insulting people, such as his veiled threats about using President Bill Clinton's sex scandal against Hillary Clinton, is not likely to change. Nastiness does not play well in a general election, but being nasty has always been a key element of Trump's repertoire.\n\nAmong Trump's advisers, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who shares much in common with Trump, is a cause for concern. Like Trump, Giuliani poses as a tough man and wants the world to believe that his meanness is a virtue. He is also, like his candidate, a thrice-married man who feels entitled to criticize Hillary Clinton's lifelong marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's lack of preparation, poor sportsmanship, and inability to learn from his mistakes make it difficult to see him changing his ways in time for the next debate. His advisors face a daunting task in trying to help him prepare for the next debate, and it remains to be seen if they will be able to overcome the candidate's 40-plus years of doing things his way.",
    " Title: Economist Bryan Caplan Challenges the Value of College Education: A Critical Look at the Cost and Benefit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, economist Bryan Caplan, in his new book \"The Case Against Education,\" questions the value of a college education, arguing that most people should not go. This contrasts with President Obama's assertion that college graduation has never been more valuable.\n\nCaplan, in a YouTube video, points out that the high cost of tuition is not the only issue at hand. He questions the years spent in school, suggesting that individuals could have been doing something else instead. He argues that college education may not be directly linked to job skills and that the primary reason for attending college is to secure a good job.\n\nCaplan contends that the connection between college education and job performance is tenuous. He suggests that the increase in income associated with fancier degrees is not due to the skills acquired in college but rather the diploma serving as a signaling device, indicating that the individual was smart enough to complete college.\n\nCaplan compares the current education system to a crowded concert where everyone stands up to see better, but everyone blocks each other's view. In this analogy, a high-end waiter with a college degree is equivalent to someone standing up at the concert. Caplan's argument is that as more people go to college, the value of the diploma diminishes.\n\nWhen asked about individual college attendance, Caplan clarified that he is not advocating against personal college attendance but rather questioning the collective subsidization of college education. He suggests that students can learn without incurring tuition debt by attending college lectures for free, although he acknowledges that this is not a common practice.\n\nCaplan also questions the value of liberal arts education, suggesting that it may not expand people's minds as much as commonly believed. A study found that a third of people have not detectably learned anything after four years in college.\n\nAlthough Caplan is critical of the college education system, he acknowledges that there is one group of people who benefit: professors like himself. Caplan, a tenured professor, enjoys a stable income and minimal demands on his time. He is only expected to teach for five hours a week.\n\nIn conclusion, Caplan's arguments challenge the traditional view of college education, questioning its cost, its connection to job performance, and the value of liberal arts education. His arguments provide food for thought for those considering higher education and for policymakers shaping education policy.",
    " Title: Search and Rescue Efforts Suspended for Military Personnel After Black Hawk Helicopter Crash Off Florida Coast\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, a Black Hawk helicopter carrying seven Marines and four Army aircrew members crashed into waters off the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night, leading to a massive search and rescue operation. The helicopter, first reported missing at around 8:30 p.m., was found with debris around Okaloosa Island near Eglin Air Force Base.\n\nThe search, which is expected to resume midday Thursday, has involved over 100 personnel from the Air Force, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies. The search-and-rescue mission remains ongoing, with boats scouring the waters throughout the night, weather permitting. Human remains have washed ashore in the area near Eglin.\n\nGen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed his condolences, stating, \"We will work with the services to ensure that the family members of those involved in the mishap will be well cared for.\"\n\nThe Air Force, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies are focusing their search on the area where they believe the aircraft went down, in waters east of the town of Navarre and the Navarre Bridge and near Eglin testing range site A-17. The service members were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations.\n\nThe UH-60 helicopter was not alone when it went down. A second Black Hawk, assigned to 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond, Louisiana, safely returned to the base. The aircraft were both assigned to the Louisiana Army National Guard out of Hammond and were participating in a \"routine training mission involving the Marine Special Operations Regiment\" out of Camp Lejeune.\n\nThe cause of the accident is still unknown, with no indication of anything suspicious. The heavy fog in the area at the time of the incident is being investigated as a potential factor in the crash.\n\nAs the search and rescue efforts continue, the families of the service members involved are in the thoughts and prayers of all those involved in the mission. The names of the service members will not be released until the Coast Guard recovers their bodies or calls off the search.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.",
    " Title: California Defies Federal Government, Enacts Strict Net Neutrality Law Amidst Legal Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold move, California has reinstated Obama-era net neutrality rules, defying the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Trump administration. The new law, which also bans internet service providers from offering free data for specific apps, was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on Sunday.\n\nShortly after the bill's enactment, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions stating, \"The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today, but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was supported by FCC chairman Ajit Pai, who has been a vocal critic of the California law. Pai, the architect of the White House's net neutrality agenda, called the law \"extreme,\" \"illegal,\" and \"radical.\" He also claimed the new law would hurt consumers, stating that it would prohibit many free-data plans, which allow consumers to stream video, music, and other data-intensive content exempt from any data limits.\n\nThe legality of statewide net neutrality laws is a contentious issue. Proponents of the California law argue that the FCC has no power to interfere in state legislation, as the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order removed its authority to adopt such protections. Barbara van Schewick, a law professor at Stanford Law School, told CNN, \"An agency that has no power to regulate has no power to preempt the states. When the FCC repealed the 2015 Open Internet Order, it said it had no power to regulate broadband Internet access providers. That means the FCC can not prevent the states from adopting net-neutrality protections because the FCC's repeal order removed its authority to adopt such protections.\"\n\nThe legal battle between the federal government and California is not without political implications. The administration's actions are seen as a response to President Trump's personal war with Silicon Valley, following Trump's accusations of bias in Google's search results and Sessions' subsequent meeting with state attorneys general to discuss potential antitrust violations by tech companies.\n\nWhile the lawsuit may not be a political winner for the Trump administration, it is likely to be welcomed by conservatives, who have historically taken issue with California's progressive stances on various issues, including clean energy and immigration. The lawsuit is a more concrete threat than the meeting, which experts dismissed as groundless saber-rattling at the behest of a furious president. However, it is worth noting that a majority of voters favor Obama-era net-neutrality rules.",
    " Title: Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm Criticizes Donald Trump's Rhetoric, Calls for Him to Exit Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing commentary, former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm has called out Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for causing \"irreparable damage\" to the United States with his rhetoric. Granholm, who is currently a senior research fellow at UC Berkeley and a senior advisor to Correct The Record, a super-PAC supporting Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, expressed her concern that Trump's lies and vitriolic language are harming the nation.\n\nGranholm, in her piece titled \"The Leadership Challenge,\" cited a best-selling book on leadership by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, which states that 89% of people across the globe identify honesty as the most important characteristic of a leader. Granholm noted that it is surprising that despite Trump's weekly lies and offenses towards people of various races, creeds, and colors, he has managed to lead the Republican presidential candidate polls for five months.\n\nGranholm criticized Trump for his intentional lies, such as fabricating historical events to embellish his golf course or spreading false claims about a nonexistent video showing Muslims celebrating in New Jersey after the twin towers fell. She pointed out that Trump's lies are not careless or unintentional mistakes but rather a deliberate choice to disregard reality and double down on his falsehoods.\n\nGranholm's commentary comes as Trump continues to lead the Republican presidential race, despite his repeated claims that fail to align with reality. The former Michigan governor's call for Trump to exit the race is a plea for the good of the country, as she believes his lies are causing significant harm to the nation's democracy and unity.",
    " Title: Fox Criticizes Obama Administration for Limited Extension of Pre-ACA Insurance Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent segment on Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade and former health insurance agent C. Edmund Wright discussed the Obama administration's decision to allow insurance companies to extend current policies for an additional year. Wright criticized the administration for not allowing individuals to keep their insurance policies indefinitely, referring to the one-year extension as a \"one-year death sentence\" for insurance policies.\n\nWright argued that President Obama's promise to allow individuals to keep their policies if they liked them was not fulfilled with the one-year extension. He stated that the extension was not a fix for the underlying insurance problem, as it would lead to a \"one-year death sentence\" for insurance policies, causing insurers and customers to go after each other.\n\nIn contrast, The Washington Post's Wonkblog reported that the Obama administration's decision to allow insurance companies to renew policies that do not meet the Affordable Care Act (ACA) standards through the end of 2014 was not an order for insurers to offer their products for another year. Instead, it was a request for insurers to provide the option for policyholders to renew their current plans for one more year, if their insurance company chose to do so.\n\nMSNBC's Steven Rattner, an economic analyst and former Obama administration official, explained on MSNBC's Morning Joe that half of people on the individual market are there for less than six months, and another 30 percent are there between six and eighteen months. The Washington Post's fact checker cited a study that measured insurance plans in California, showing that only 24 percent of people with individual coverage kept their plan for more than two years.\n\nIn a November 2009 letter to former Senator Evan Bayh, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explained that because of the naturally high turnover in the individual market, few grandfathered policies would still exist by 2016.\n\nThe Fox & Friends segment sparked debate among viewers, with some agreeing with Wright's criticism of the Obama administration's decision and others arguing that the extension was a reasonable solution to the issue of canceled policies. The debate highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the implementation of the ACA and the impact it has had on individuals' insurance policies.",
    " Title: Trump's First Executive Order: A Directive to Dismantle the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his inaugural parade, President Donald Trump has issued his first executive order, instructing federal agencies to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the maximum extent permitted by law. This political move signals a clear intention to unwind the health care law, with the order directing agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay any taxes or penalties they can.\n\nLarry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, explains that the executive order doesn't immediately change the ACA, but it sets the stage for federal agencies to begin taking steps to unwind the law in various ways. This is a signal that the Trump administration is not waiting for Congress to initiate significant changes.\n\nThe order specifically targets provisions that impose fiscal burdens on states or individuals, which could potentially include the individual mandate, a critical component of the ACA. While Trump may be able to stop enforcing the individual mandate without Congress, this executive action alone does not dismantle the mandate or any other part of the ACA.\n\nThe order's impact is limited due to legal constraints, as Trump cannot repeal the ACA unilaterally. Health law expert Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee College, emphasizes that Trump must comply with the law, which does not allow him to repeal the ACA through executive action alone.\n\nThe executive order contains two crucial elements that Jost highlights:\n\n1) The order's directives are subject to the limitations set by the ACA. This means that Trump can revise the rules and regulations written by the Obama administration, but he cannot enact changes that conflict with the ACA.\n\n2) Trump has committed to following the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for new rules. This means that the rulemaking process, which involves drafting rules, accepting comments, holding public hearings, and ultimately issuing final rules, will take time. Important Obamacare regulations that went through the APA's rulemaking process the first time around, such as those governing the individual mandate, will need to go through a similar process for any changes to take effect.\n\nJost, who generally supports the ACA, views the executive order as expected and not particularly alarming, as he believes Trump has been advised that he cannot repeal the ACA through executive action alone. The process of unwinding the ACA through executive orders and rulemaking will be a lengthy one, with significant input from the public and the opportunity for legal challenges.",

Baucus began informing some of his colleagues and his staff about his upcoming nomination on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe departure of the third longest-serving senator, who has been a central figure in battles over trade, taxes, and health care for a generation, could very well shake up the 2014 landscape where Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to recapture the Senate majority.\n\nBaucus, who has served in the Senate since 1978, has already announced he will not run for reelection in 2014. If he leaves before his term ends, Baucus would relinquish his gavel on the powerful Senate Finance Committee at a time when he is still aggressively pushing for a dramatic rewrite of the Tax Code, putting its chances in peril this Congress.\n\nThe Montana Democrat's expected nomination had been rumored in congressional circles for the last month. It only became clear in recent days that the White House would make the appointment, according to sources. A White House spokesman didn't respond to an e-mail requesting comment, and a Baucus spokesman declined to comment.\n\nBaucus' departure would open up a key spot running the Senate Finance Committee, one of the most powerful positions in Congress given its sweeping authority over tax and health care programs. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the liberal West Virginia Democrat, is next in line to chair the panel.\n\nRockefeller, too, is retiring at the end of next year, and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden is widely expected to take the top Democratic spot in the next Congress.

    " Title: Former CIA Director John Brennan's Role in Political Espionage Under Scrutiny as He Joins NBC as 'National Security' Correspondent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, John Brennan, former CIA director under the Obama administration, has joined NBC as a 'national security' correspondent, sparking controversy and concerns about the objectivity of his role in the media. Brennan, who has a history of political involvement, has described himself on Twitter as a \"nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that a more accurate description for Brennan would be a \"liberal partisan who is very concerned about our collectivist future.\" This characterization stems from Brennan's past, which includes a lie-detector test in which he admitted his support for the Soviet-controlled American Communist party, and his role in the 2016 election as a key figure in a sham investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nBrennan's ascent to the top of the CIA was marked by controversy, with some viewing him as the \"fox guarding the henhouse.\" His new role at NBC, where he will comment on national security matters, has raised questions about the impartiality of the media, with some asking where the successors to the Kalb brothers are to challenge figures with a vested interest in the outcome of their stories.\n\nBrennan is currently under Congressional investigation for possible perjury, and his role in the Steele dossier has come under scrutiny. NBC's decision to give him a platform to continue his narrative has been criticized, with some questioning the addition of Sally Yates, Susan Rice, and Christopher Steele as potential \"correspondents.\"\n\nLast week, Jonathan Winer, a State Department official during the Obama administration, outed himself as a key player in the Obamagate scandal. Winer, who once tried to write a film treatment for Oliver Stone, briefed John Kerry and his team on the Hillary-financed Steele dossier during the heat of the campaign, and later passed material from Cody Shearer, another dirt-diver for Hillary, to Steele (who then gave it to the FBI).\n\nWiner's role in the scandal was downplayed, with him casting his friendship with Steele and Sidney Blumenthal in a nonpartisan light. Winer also claimed that he was unaware of Shearer's work, only becoming aware of his Trump-Russian notes after being informed by Blumenthal. However, Winer's decision to share Shearer's notes with Steele has been criticized, with some questioning the professional ethics of sharing unverified information with a known opposition researcher.\n\nSusan Rice's emailing herself an \"I am not guilty\" note on her last day in office has also come to light, with Rice musing on a previous meeting with President Obama. In the email, Rice emphasized that Obama was committed to ensuring that the investigation into Russian interference in the election was handled \"by the book.\" This statement has been met with skepticism, with some viewing it as a galling propagandistic high-wire act that the Rices, Brennans, and Winers can only pull off because the media holds an ever-widening net underneath them.\n\nThe actions of these figures have raised questions about the lawlessness that launched many of their careers, with some arguing that they never lost their radical tendencies, but brought them with them into the government. Their attempts to tilt the election to a political ideology have been met with failure, but have left a lasting impact on the political landscape.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes New Sanctions on Russia, Sparking Threats of Retaliation and Market Volatility\n\nThe United States has announced a new round of sanctions against Russia, in response to the nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K. This move has led to a decline in the Russian ruble and market volatility, as well as threats of retaliation from the Kremlin.\n\nThe U.S. administration is under pressure to take tougher steps against Russia, following President Donald Trump's controversial summit with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last month. The new sanctions, which are required under the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, will limit exports to Russia of U.S. goods and technology considered sensitive on national security grounds.\n\nThe initial round of these sanctions will take effect on August 22 and will include restrictions on exports of electronics, lasers, and some specialized oil and gas production technologies. Waivers will be allowed for space-flight activities and U.S. foreign assistance. Russia's response has been defiant but vague, with officials suggesting potential restrictions on trade with the U.S. under a law passed earlier this year in response to an earlier wave of penalties.\n\nThe additional sanctions could include a downgrading in diplomatic relations, blanket bans on the import of Russian oil and exports of \"all other goods and technology\" aside from agricultural products, as well as limits on loans from U.S. banks. The U.S. also would have to suspend aviation agreements and oppose any multilateral development bank assistance.\n\nThe added sanctions could be averted if President Trump declares that waiving them would be in the U.S. national interest, a politically risky move in light of criticism that he's been too soft on Russia on issues including interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Skripal case and has held out little hope for compromise.\n\nThe market volatility caused by the new sanctions has been significant, with the ruble reaching its lowest levels since 2016, though it has since recovered some of its losses. Stocks like Aeroflot and VTB, which could be targeted by some of the new restrictions, fell more than 7 percent but have since recovered most of their losses.\n\nThe question remains as to the extent of the market sell-off, as some analysts believe that these sanctions will reach key energy and financial names and the Russian sovereign. The added sanctions could have far-reaching implications for the global economy, particularly in the energy sector, as Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers.",
    " Title: Trump's Trade War Escalation: Uncertainty Surrounds U.S.-China Trade Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold move, President Trump has reaffirmed his stance on the ongoing trade dispute with China, threatening to impose tariffs on an additional $16 billion worth of Chinese goods, following the initial $34 billion tariffs already implemented. The President has further warned of potential tariffs on up to $450 billion of Chinese goods, signaling a significant escalation in the trade war.\n\nHowever, the outcome of this trade conflict remains uncertain, with both sides seemingly dug in for a prolonged battle. China has vowed retaliation in response to the U.S. threats, creating a stalemate that requires one party to concede in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two nations, and internal disagreements within the Trump administration about the best course of action, a swift resolution appears increasingly unlikely.\n\nEdward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, expressed his doubts, stating, \"At the moment, I don't see how this ends. This is very much in the president's hands because he's got advisers that seem divided, some substantively, some tactically. I just don't think we've had any clear signs of the resolution he wants.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's aggressive trade policies extend beyond China, with tariffs imposed on foreign steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines from countries such as Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan. However, the tariffs on China, the world's largest manufacturing hub, impact a broader range of products and a larger percentage of companies that rely on global supply chains, potentially causing more harm to American companies than the Chinese firms the administration is targeting.\n\nPresident Trump's hardline approach toward China is driven by the White House's belief in China's alleged unfair trade practices and theft of American intellectual property. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is imposing restrictions on investment and visas for Chinese nationals. The administration argues that these trade barriers are being used as leverage to compel China to make changes, including opening its markets to American companies and ending its practice of requiring firms operating in China to transfer valuable technology.\n\nAs the trade war between the U.S. and China continues to unfold, the impact on global markets and the economy remains a significant concern. The uncertainty surrounding the trade conflict is causing ripples across industries, and the potential for further escalation could have far-reaching consequences.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at the Policy Proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary, the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders has been framed by some Clinton supporters as a choice between an unrealistic radical and a pragmatic political veteran. However, this framing raises two significant questions. First, there is little evidence to suggest that less ambitious proposals will yield better results. Second, in crucial policy areas, Clinton has not proposed any concrete solutions at all.\n\nOne of the key proponents of Clinton's pragmatic approach is Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and a prominent liberal commentator. In response to Sanders supporters who argue for ambitious goals as a means of political organizing and as a starting point for negotiations, Krugman presents two arguments.\n\nFirst, because Clinton's proposals are realistic, they could pass if Democrats win control of Congress. Second, Sanders' \"magical unicorn\" proposals are unworkable and can only be sold with misinformation about their costs, and because the media is biased against social insurance, this will supposedly benefit the Republican candidate.\n\nLet's examine the second argument first. Sanders' single-payer healthcare proposal is more robust than Krugman suggests. A left-leaning think tank recently analyzed his plan, showing that everyone outside of the top 1% would end up with a net positive income\u2014the increased taxation would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance premiums. While this may be an idealized scenario, it's worth noting that the United States has the worst healthcare system among industrialized nations. We spend far more per person than any other rich nation, yet our health outcomes are mediocre at best. If we could improve our politics, it should be relatively easy to significantly enhance our healthcare system by adopting policies from other countries. Krugman's characterization of Sanders as a healthcare crank is, therefore, inaccurate.\n\nMoving on to the argument that Clinton's proposals are more realistic, it's unclear how this applies to healthcare, as Clinton has not proposed any substantial healthcare reforms. A visit to her issues page reveals no plan to address the underinsurance problem in Obamacare or to provide insurance to the approximately 30 million uninsured Americans. There is some acknowledgment of the problems, but no suggestions for solutions\u2014a stark contrast to Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta's bullet-point plan to defeat ISIS, which began with \"defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\"\n\nAnother policy area where Clinton's proposals are lacking is monetary policy, the most critical economic policy lever. Krugman himself has consistently argued that the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates last December was a mistake. Sanders is the only candidate from either party who agrees with him on this point. Krugman has not mentioned this, instead attacking Sanders for supporting a bill that would increase congressional oversight of the Fed. Meanwhile, Clinton's economy page does not even mention monetary policy at all.\n\nIf any candidate's ideas deserve the \"magical unicorn\" epithet, it's the one whose proposals do not exist. As Steve Randy Waldman points out, the primary purpose of political campaigns is to advance moral values and set priorities. While policy experts may prefer a politics that maximizes the importance of their hard-won knowledge, the simple truth is that the majority of people do not pay attention to complex policy proposals, tortuous political negotiations, or intricate policy analyses. Instead, they vote for candidates who seem to align with their values, relying on them to navigate the incomprehensible policy landscape. Experienced policy people are there for when you need someone to hammer out an actual bill. However, an important job, it is a secondary one.\n\nUltimately, people can support whichever candidate they choose. But let's not pretend that there is a clear-cut policy case for Hillary Clinton. Her policy book is missing some crucial chapters.",
    " Title: North Korea-US Summit: Kim Jong Un's Letter to Trump Suggests Different Approach to Denuclearization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly expressed a desire to meet with President Donald Trump, but without indicating a willingness for his country to make concessions in the ongoing denuclearization talks.\n\nAccording to an unnamed foreign official who spoke to the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Kim wrote in a letter that he still wanted to meet with Trump. The letter was hand-delivered to Trump by Kim Yong Chol, a top North Korean official considered Kim Jong Un's right-hand man, around 1 pm on Friday at the White House.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump announced that he would meet with Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. However, Trump told reporters he had yet to read the letter, saying he could be in \"for a big surprise\" once he looks at it.\n\nHowever, in Kim's note, he reportedly does not express a desire for his country to make any concessions, even though he doesn't threaten the US in any way. This could potentially foreshadow a bigger problem later on, as the Trump administration has been insisting on complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization (CVID) from North Korea quickly. This would require Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program very soon, a process that a top expert says could take around 15 years to complete.\n\nNorth Korea, however, wants a phased approach in which both Washington and Pyongyang make a few concessions over a long period of time, according to experts. This could mean North Korea allows inspectors to view its nuclear sites in exchange for the US diplomatically recognizing the Kim regime.\n\nIt's possible that the letter only reinforces the yawning gap between the two sides. But some experts argue that the summit might address those concerns. \"We can continue to narrow the gap and get to a place where we do have a meaningful dialogue towards an eventual resolution,\" Joseph Yun, a US Institute of Peace expert and former top North Korea negotiator in the Trump administration, told reporters on Friday.\n\nTrump is planning to spend the weekend at Camp David discussing the US agenda for the possible summit. But it's unclear what, exactly, he will do after he reads the North Korean leader's note. The development comes as a setback for those hoping for a swift resolution to the nuclear standoff, but it also offers a glimmer of hope that dialogue might continue.",
    " Title: Trump Attorney Giuliani Accuses Mueller Team of Leaking Information to Trap President in Perjury Trap\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani refuted speculation that White House counsel Donald McGahn had flipped on President Trump, accusing investigators of leaking information about McGahn's cooperation with the special counsel in order to lure the president into a perjury trap.\n\nGiuliani stated, \"They're down to desperation time. They have to write a report, and they don't have a single bit of evidence.\" The New York Times, citing multiple unidentified sources, reported Saturday that McGahn had spent 30 hours over three days answering questions as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nThe report has fueled comparisons to Nixon White House counsel John Dean's decision to switch sides during the Watergate investigation. However, former Trump attorney John Dowd dismissed such speculation, stating, \"Pure fiction on claims of pushback by McGahn.\" Dowd added, \"Don McGahn was a terrific witness for the president. I debriefed him.\"\n\nDowd also defended the Trump administration's open-book legal strategy of providing extensive access to witnesses and documents. He said Mueller told him that no one lied and no documents were withheld.\n\nGiuliani accused the special counsel's office of leaking the report to spur Trump into testifying, then setting him up for a perjury charge by having him contradict statements by former FBI Director James B. Comey about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\n\"I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury,\" Giuliani said. \"When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly, because it's someone's version of the truth, not the truth.\"\n\nGiuliani found himself in a different kind of trap after he countered host Chuck Todd's assertion that \"truth is truth\" with, \"No, truth isn't truth.\"\n\n\"This is going to be a bad meme,\" said a laughing Mr. Todd, while Giuliani responded, \"No, don't do this to me.\"\n\nGiuliani described a situation as a case of he-said, he-said: \"Donald Trump says, 'I didn't talk about Flynn with Comey.' Comey says, 'You did talk about it.' So tell me what the truth is.\"\n\nThe Times report said McGahn decided to cooperate fully because he was worried that the president was trying to set him up to take the fall for any obstruction charges by refusing to shield their conversations with executive or attorney-client privilege.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday that the story was a \"fake piece,\" that he had \"nothing to hide\" and that his administration was the \"most transparent in history.\"\n\nIn a statement, the New York Times communications department said the newspaper \"stands behind the reporting of our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters.\"\n\nMcGahn attorney William A. Burck released a statement confirming that his client had cooperated fully.\n\n\"President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must,\" said the statement.\n\nGiuliani said the president has \"encouraged all the people who testified to tell the truth, to take as long as they needed to do that, and as long as they did, they'll have no problem with the president or us.\"\n\nHe added, \"And we have no reason to believe that Don McGahn didn't do that.\"\n\nGiuliani stated that the leak indicated that the Mueller team is panicking because \"they know they don't have a case, there was no collusion, there was no obstruction, they can't prove it, and they are trying to get the president to testify.\"\n\nHe said the president has turned over 1.4 million documents, encouraged more than 30 witnesses including Mr. McGahn to testify, and declined to assert executive privilege as part of his commitment to transparency.\n\nTrump's decision to decline to assert executive and attorney-client privilege has come into question, but Dowd said \"it was smarter to be transparent and get the case over with.\"\n\n\"We made available 37 witnesses and a million documents,\" said Dowd. \"In terms of McGahn, he's right at the heart of the case and they had a lot to cover with him and a lot of notes. It was all routine and very normal. The anonymous sources that criticize us for our strategy don't realize that the alternative was a nightmare, just a war.\"",
    " Title: \"Bernie Sanders Emerges as Front-Runner in Democratic Presidential Race, Offering a New Direction for America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders has taken the lead in the Democratic presidential race. While former Vice President Joe Biden is favored in the upcoming South Carolina primary, bolstered by his support among African American voters, Sanders enters the state with significant momentum, having won the popular vote in each of the first three contests.\n\nSanders' victory in Nevada showcases the broad coalition he is building. He led the field among men and women, among whites and Latinos, among union households and non-union households, among voters of all ages, except those over 65, among Democrats who identified as liberals, moderates, and conservatives.\n\nSanders and Elizabeth Warren have presented Americans with a new direction, not just another candidate. Both have advocated for a modern version of what Franklin D. Roosevelt called the Economic Bill of Rights: Medicare for all, tuition-free public education, universal day care, a Green New Deal to create jobs while addressing climate change. They propose taxing the wealthy and corporations to fund essential public investments in the common good.\n\nThe other candidates, notably Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Mike Bloomberg, have criticized these ideas as too radical, too bold, too costly, and too ambitious. They offer a continuation of the politics that existed before Donald Trump disrupted the country. However, this approach may not offer much hope for most Americans.\n\nSanders identifies as a \"democratic socialist,\" while Warren prefers the term \"making markets work.\" Yet, their agendas are more similar in substance than they are different in label.\n\nAs the election progresses, voters can expect to hear more about the label \"democratic socialist.\" Critics, such as Trump and Bloomberg, may portray it as akin to Venezuela or Cuba. However, the crucial word in \"democratic socialism\" is democratic, not socialist. Sanders is not advocating for making America into Cuba or Venezuela; he is advocating for extending social guarantees like those offered in most other advanced industrial states, such as Denmark or Sweden.\n\nThese countries have universal health care at lower cost, paid family leave, guaranteed paid vacations, higher minimum wages, more generous public retirement programs, vibrant and competitive economies, lower inequality, less poverty, and higher life expectancies.\n\nSanders is seeking a popular mandate from voters to move in this direction. When considering democratic socialism, it's essential to remember the programs that Republicans and conservatives, as well as corporate lobbies, once denounced as socialistic: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, environmental and consumer protection, banking regulation to protect consumers.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which manages our nation's civil aviation and international waters, is a state program. The Food and Drug Administration, which ensures that drugs are safe, is a state program. The minimum wage, food stamps, public housing could all be considered democratic socialist programs.\n\nOur problem has been that we have too much socialism for the rich and the powerful\u2014subsidies for corporations, get-out-of-jail-free cards for crooked bankers, tax breaks for the rich that leave them paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries, monopoly power for corporations that allows them to gouge customers.\n\nOn the other hand, we have too little shared security\u2014democratic socialism\u2014for working people: affordable health care, a living wage, guaranteed paid vacation and family leave, universal childcare, affordable college, public mobilization to deal with the threat of climate change.\n\nWhen I ran for the presidency, I didn't use the label, although some tried to slur me as a socialist or a communist. However, the label doesn't make a difference. The question is one of direction, not name-calling; of program, not posturing.\n\nAs Dr. Martin Luther King, often smeared as a \"red\" or a communist, was very clear, \"You can't talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of the slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"\n\nSo, put aside the fearmongering and the red-baiting; take a look instead at the substance. There's no question we need big structural change, as Elizabeth Warren puts it. We need a better distribution of wealth, and a greater protection of basic human rights like the right to affordable health care, as Sanders argues.\n\nCall it capitalism with a conscience, democratic socialism, or lemonade. It's the substance, not the label, that counts.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Vows Legal Action to Secure Testimony of Former White House Counsel Don McGahn\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated turn of events, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, has vowed to take legal action if necessary to secure the testimony of former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who defied a subpoena and skipped a committee hearing at President Trump's direction.\n\nThe move has infuriated Democrats and could potentially ignite another high-profile battle over holding a Trump official in contempt of Congress.\n\n\"Let me be clear, this committee will hear Mr. McGahn's testimony, even if we have to go to court to secure it,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, said at the beginning of the hearing which McGahn did not attend.\n\nAccusing Trump of witness intimidation, Nadler added, \"When this committee issues a subpoena, even to a senior presidential adviser, the witness must show up. Our subpoenas are not optional.\"\n\nWhile he did not specifically mention contempt, Nadler told CNN on Monday night that lawmakers would pursue that route.\n\nA day earlier, the president directed McGahn to not appear for the committee hearing, citing a Justice Department opinion that he can not be compelled to testify about his official duties.\n\n\"In short, the president took it upon himself to intimidate a witness who has a legal obligation to be here today,\" Nadler said. \"This conduct is not remotely acceptable.\"\n\nGeorgia Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member on the committee, responded to Nadler's remarks by accusing Democrats of political theatrics, saying they are \"trying desperately to make something out of nothing.\"\n\n\"I can not emphasize this enough \u2014 the chairman's track record demonstrates he does not actually want information, he wants the fight, but not the truth,\" Collins said.\n\nEarlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair \u2014 alongside a prop chicken \u2014 when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.\n\nIn a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a \"wasteful and unnecessary do-over\" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe \u2014 and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.\n\nThe related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has \"immunity\" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.\n\n\"This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,\" the memo said.\n\nThe committee announced the hearing last week, but it was initially unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.\n\nThe committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Mueller's report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump's call to have him seek Mueller's removal.\n\nThe report also revealed that when the media reported on the president's request, the president directed White House officials \"to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed. \" He did not.\n\nThe House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.\n\nEarlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.\n\nTrump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.",
    " Title: Mental Health and the Virginia Shooting: A Psychiatrist's Perspective on Delusional Thinking and Workplace Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at WDBJ7 in Virginia, where Vester Flanagan, the shooter, took the lives of two journalists and a cameraman, questions have arisen about the shooter's motivations. Was Flanagan an angry, disgruntled individual with extreme prejudice towards whites, or was he a psychotic individual whose delusions were focused on perceived (but nonexistent) racial and gay smears directed at him?\n\nIn a 20-year career as an adult, adolescent, and forensic psychiatrist, I have evaluated numerous individuals whose paranoia (a psychotic delusion) focused on the government besieging them or on an individual or group of individuals, including co-workers, plotting against them. When questioned, they may reveal that they also believe they are being followed by the CIA or that their employer has implanted listening devices inside their bodies.\n\nIt is possible that Flanagan was a man with a grudge who came to hate whites, or a man with severe narcissism who struck out at those who did not agree he was extraordinary, or a man commandeered by delusions, in his case, perhaps, paranoia that attached itself to an unshakable belief that stray words or phrases or random acts were actually ways people were intentionally trying to undermine him.\n\nOne example of this delusional thinking is a man I once treated who believed his friend, who had no prior business experience, was secretly attempting to undermine his very successful corporation. When I asked for evidence that this was occurring, he told me that his friend had asked him where in China his Chinese investors were from. That seemingly innocuous question was sucked into the vortex of my client's delusional structure and, for him, confirmed the worst. \"Why would he want to know where they were from, if he wasn't trying to contact them?\" he asked me.\n\nWe may never know whether Flanagan was a man with a grudge who came to hate whites, or a man with severe narcissism who struck out at those who did not agree he was extraordinary, or a man commandeered by delusions. However, it is crucial for employers (or family members) of someone who begins to communicate or behave in ways that are extreme and seemingly irrational to consider whether that behavior is best defined as irritable and wrong-minded, or whether it could be a reflection of a deeper, intractable, delusional way that that person is viewing the people in his life and events unfolding around him.\n\nThus far, we have no evidence that anyone in Mr. Flanagan's life was able to make that determination before he ended the lives of others. It is a reminder of the importance of understanding and addressing mental health issues in the workplace and in our personal lives, to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.",
    " Title: Is Washington's Gridlock a Feature, Not a Bug?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of political division and the seemingly insurmountable challenge of bipartisan cooperation, Congress has been criticized for its inability to pass significant legislation and address pressing issues. However, a government scholar argues that the current lament about Washington's dysfunction may be misguided.\n\nPietro Nivola, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, contends that the United States' political system has shown resilience in navigating the Great Recession and its aftermath, compared to many other advanced democracies. In a recent article, Nivola questions whether the United States' 'gridlocked' and 'broken' political system might actually be performing better than expected.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, Congress has passed several key pieces of legislation, including the bank bailout bill known as TARP, the rescue of the domestic auto industry, the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and an enormous stimulus bill. Nivola describes Congress's inability to pass more recent budget and tax measures as a \"useful stasis,\" meaning that had the House and Senate agreed on a course of action, the ideas might have done more harm.\n\nHowever, Nivola expresses concern about how Congress will respond to the fiscal challenges it faces after the November election, with the expiration date for the Bush tax cuts and a series of automatic spending cuts looming. He suggests that Congress's inability to address the long-term picture is a source of paralysis.\n\nBill Connelly, a political scientist at Washington and Lee University and author of the book James Madison Rules America, offers a different perspective. He argues that Congress's partisan brinkmanship is a feature, not a bug, of the American system of checks and balances. Connelly compares Congress to college students who complete their work at the last minute, waiting for deadlines to loom.\n\nNot everyone shares this optimistic view. Even when Congress manages to find a resolution, the process of legislative sausage-making can be so open and ugly that some worry that bad congressional habits and bipartisan disagreements have become problems in and of themselves.\n\nJust last month, Washington state Governor Christine Gregoire complained that Congress's last-minute deal in August to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a government shutdown had cost her state $1.4 billion in projected economic growth, as consumer confidence took a hit.\n\nSarah Binder, a colleague of Nivola's at Brookings and a Congress watcher at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., agrees that there is a cost to this type of legislating. \"Even if at the end of the day we stare at the abyss and reach agreement, that's probably not good enough,\" she says.\n\nIn conclusion, while the public's perception of Washington's policymaking is negative, the debate about the effectiveness of the American political system remains ongoing. Some argue that the system's checks and balances have allowed it to navigate the Great Recession relatively well, while others worry that the open and ugly process of legislative sausage-making is causing harm in and of itself.",
    " Title: Top 10 Delusional Moments in the 2012 Presidential Campaign: A Revelation from the Horse's Mouth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented gathering at Harvard University, top officials from the 2012 presidential campaigns opened up about their decision-making process, revealing a series of mistakes and missed opportunities that characterized the election cycle. The eight-hour discussion, moderated by journalists, offered a candid insight into the strategies employed by the campaigns and the regrets that followed.\n\nThe conference, sponsored by the Institute of Politics since 1972, was particularly significant this year, with representatives from all the GOP primary campaigns and the president's team in attendance. Listening to the GOP campaigns revisit their losses was at times painful but also offered some insights into how a campaign can delude itself to secure the brass ring.\n\nHere are the top 10 delusional moments of the 2012 election, as told by those who lived it:\n\n1. The much-mocked TV ad run by the Romney campaign in the closing weeks of the Ohio campaign, which claimed that President Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who were going to build Jeeps in China, was defended by Romney strategist Stuart Stevens. Despite the ad being widely criticized as misleading, Stevens argued that it provided people with information and reassured them, reducing the impact of the ads that had been run against Romney.\n\n2. The decision to have Clint Eastwood speak at the GOP convention in Tampa was another delusional moment. Romney's top strategists believed that Eastwood's presence would draw a larger viewing audience, unaware that the aging actor would speak to an empty chair, upstaging Romney's convention address. The ensuing controversy was a windfall for the Obama campaign, riling the Democratic base and reinforcing a clear message that was critical in Ohio, in terms of the auto industry and the president's positions.\n\nThe remaining eight delusional moments, ranging from the selection of running mates to the handling of foreign policy, were equally enlightening, offering a unique perspective on the intricacies of political campaigns and the fine line between strategy and delusion. The candid confessions serve as a reminder of the complexities and unpredictability that characterize the political landscape, and the lessons learned from these delusional moments may prove invaluable in future elections.",
    " Title: Global Protective Equipment and Drug Export Bans: A World in Disarray\n\nIn a move that has sparked international concern, the Trump administration last week invoked a Korean War-era law to restrict exports of protective masks produced in the United States, with American companies manufacturing such equipment overseas being directed to prioritize domestic demand. The decision has been met with criticism from companies like 3M, who argue that such a move could jeopardize the health of workers in countries like Canada and Latin America.\n\nIn recent weeks, a growing number of countries have imposed similar export bans on protective equipment and critical medical supplies. Turkey, Ukraine, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa, and Ecuador have all restricted the export of protective masks. France and Germany have banned exports of masks and other protective gear, lifting the bans only after the European Union barred exports outside the bloc. India has banned exports of respirators and disinfectants.\n\nBritain has prohibited exports of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug being tested for potential benefits against the virus. Hungary has banned exports of the raw material for that drug and medicines that contain it.\n\nMariangela Simao, assistant director-general for medicines and health products at the World Health Organization in Geneva, expressed concern over the export bans, stating, \"The export bans are not helpful. They can disrupt supply chains of some products that are actually needed everywhere.\"\n\nPresident Trump has been particularly aggressive in securing an American stockpile of hydroxychloroquine, disregarding the counsel of federal scientists who have warned that testing remains minimal, with scant evidence of benefits. India, the world's largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, imposed an export ban last month, though limited exceptions were allowed.\n\nSatish Kumar, an adjunct professor at the International Institute of Health Management Research in New Delhi, commented on the situation, stating, \"In this situation, each country has to take care of itself. If we are not able to take care of our population, it will be a very critical situation.\"\n\nThe global race to secure critical medical supplies and drugs has led to a complex web of export restrictions, raising questions about the effectiveness of such measures in ensuring national self-sufficiency and their impact on global supply chains. As the pandemic continues to evolve, the international community must grapple with these challenges and work towards a more coordinated and equitable approach to securing global health security.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Protests May Have Slowed COVID-19 Spread in Cities with Large Demonstrations, Including Denver\n\nArticle:\n\nAs protests against racism and police violence swept across the country, drawing massive crowds into the streets amid a pandemic, public health officials worried about what the overall impact would be. A new study by a nationwide research team that includes a University of Colorado Denver professor has found something surprising: The protests may have slowed the overall spread of the coronavirus in cities with large demonstrations, including Denver.\n\nThe study, led by Andrew Friedson, a CU-Denver professor who is one of the paper's co-authors, found that the protests may have led to more social distancing because people were avoiding the protests. This overall effect for the entire city resulted in more social distancing.\n\nFriedson, an economist specializing in the economics of health care, and his colleagues used official coronavirus case counts and anonymous, aggregated cell phone data to answer the question of whether the protests spread the virus. The team worked quickly and published their findings earlier this month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.\n\nThe paper comes as officials in Colorado and other states are concerned about rising infections, especially among young people. New infections among young people have contributed significantly to Colorado's uptick in cases in recent days, reversing a weeks-long trend of falling case numbers and putting Colorado back onto the list of potential coronavirus problem spots. Meanwhile, the number of new infections among older Coloradans has dropped.\n\nWith the July 4 holiday approaching, Gov. Jared Polis and county health officials have pleaded with people to be responsible and avoid large gatherings. \"We don't have the direct causation of this uptick,\" Polis told reporters last week, noting that there is evidence that some young people who are part of an outbreak in Boulder had attended protests while other outbreaks are tied to social gatherings. \"And we hope this is a trend that is reversed in our state.\"\n\nOn Monday, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said that, while the state has now seen rising numbers of new cases for two consecutive weeks, \"we have not seen any clear association between the protests and an increase in cases.\" The spokesman, Ian Dickson, said the uptick in infections \"may be partly due to some Coloradans changing their behavior\u2014especially socializing in larger groups, sometimes without proper distancing or mask wearing.\"\n\nFriedson's paper doesn't try to figure out whether the protests spread the virus among the people at the protest. Instead, the research took the bigger-picture view: What did the protests mean for overall transmission of the virus within the entire community? The study looked at 315 American cities with populations of over 100,000 and found that 281 of those cities saw protests. The remaining 34 cities that did not see protests were used as a control group against which to measure the impact of the protests.\n\nThe researchers found that protests correlated with a net increase in overall stay-at-home behavior in cities where they occurred\u2014and the increase was larger in cities that saw more sustained protests or reports of violence. The paper also found that, with greater social distancing, COVID case growth slowed in cities with protests from what would be expected\u2014but not by a statistically significant amount. There may be other explanations for the trends, the study's authors note. Overall, though, they say the data show that any resurgence in coronavirus cases can't be pinned entirely on the protests.\n\n\"Public speech and public health did not trade off against each other in this case,\" the authors wrote in the paper. However, Friedson cautioned that the study is not a green light for governments to fully reopen bars, concert venues, and other places where people gather in large numbers. The key to the researcher's conclusions is that the protests, while receiving lots of support, were ultimately things most people decided to avoid. That's not true of many other large gatherings.\n\n\"An outdoor wedding doesn't generate avoidance behavior; we're measuring avoidance behavior,\" Friedson said. \"People don't say, 'Oh man, there's an outdoor wedding next door, we should stay home.'\"",
    " Title: Facebook Announces Redesign of Privacy Controls Amidst Data Privacy Concerns\n\nIn a bid to address growing concerns over data privacy, Facebook has announced an overhaul of its privacy controls. The changes, set to be implemented in the coming weeks, aim to make privacy settings easier to navigate, particularly on mobile devices.\n\nThe redesign will consolidate the privacy settings on a single screen, as opposed to the current 20 separate screens. Additionally, Facebook is introducing a new Privacy Shortcuts menu to simplify the process of finding privacy, security, and advertising information.\n\nFacebook's history is marked by repeated promises of improved privacy controls, with updates in 2008 and 2010. However, these promises have often been met with skepticism, as the company has been criticized for obtaining user data through complex terms and conditions that are difficult to opt out of.\n\nJessi Hempel, a senior writer at Wired, expressed her doubts about the effectiveness of these changes, stating, \"Facebook is saying, 'I've made things easier for you, but I've also revealed to you how hard it was' to control your privacy.\"\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from as many as 50 million Facebook users was harvested for political messaging purposes. It remains unclear whether these changes will persuade users who have deactivated their accounts to return, or assuage the concerns of lawmakers and privacy advocates regarding Facebook's collection and use of personal data.\n\nIn a joint post, Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer acknowledged the need for improved privacy settings, stating, \"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find.\" They also announced proposed updates to Facebook's terms of service that include the company's commitments to its users.\n\nThe changes may raise more questions than they answer, according to Josh Feldmeth, senior partner at marketing consultancy Prophet. He suggested that the announcement could turn a problem into a crisis for Facebook, given its existing trust issues.\n\nThe redesign of Facebook's privacy controls is a response to the growing scrutiny of the company's data privacy practices. Whether these changes will effectively address consumer and regulatory concerns remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Multiple People Injured in Shooting Incident Near New Orleans' French Quarter\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting incident in the early hours of Sunday near the French Quarter of New Orleans left 10 individuals injured, with the city's annual football game attracting revelers scrambling for cover and police in pursuit of at least one suspect.\n\nNew Orleans Police Department Superintendent Shaun Ferguson confirmed that the shooting took place on Canal Street near Bourbon Street, an area known for its tourist population and police presence, even at 3:20 a.m. Two of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition, with no officers among the wounded, according to Ferguson.\n\nOne individual was detained near the scene, but Ferguson stated that he did not yet know if the person played a role in the shooting. No arrests had been made as of Sunday.\n\n\"What happened in our city overnight was a cowardly and senseless act that we can not and will not tolerate,\" Ferguson said. \"While this investigation is in the very beginning stages, one thing is certain \u2013 we will not stop until we identify and arrest those responsible.\"\n\nFerguson explained that the heavy police presence in the area was due to the annual Bayou Classic football game between Grambling State University and Southern University, which had been played the previous day. The game historically draws a large crowd to the city.\n\nThree years ago, one person was killed and nine others injured following a shooting spree on Bourbon Street hours after the game.\n\nOn Sunday, Ferguson stated, \"some individuals chose to do the wrong thing at the wrong time.\" Police initially reported 10 people were wounded, later raised the number to 11, and then dropped it back to 10. Few other details were released, but Ferguson did mention that officers thought they were being fired upon and were unable to determine who was firing the shots due to the large crowd.\n\nThe motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Ferguson did not have names, genders, or ages for those wounded. Police are interviewing witnesses and searching for surveillance and other video that might provide insight into the case.\n\n\"This is the message we have been sending throughout the week,\" Ferguson said. \"Please leave your gun at home.\"\n\nState police and federal authorities are assisting the investigation.\n\nKenneth Culbreth told nola.com he was heading to the Canal Street CVS to make a quick purchase when he heard gunshots. \"I heard pops. It was so many, I couldn\u2019t keep count,\" he said.\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell described the shootings as an \"ugly disruption\" to an otherwise beautiful weekend in the city of 400,000 people. Cantrell and Ferguson noted that violent crime in the city has been in decline for four years.\n\n\"The city of New Orleans will not allow incidents like this to derail the progress we have made or to further disrupt our community,\" Cantrell said. \"This tragedy will not define us, and it will not deter us from moving our city forward and keeping our people safe.\"",
    " Title: Trump Discusses Simplified Transition from Business Empire, Anticipates Early January Press Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has stated that the process of stepping away from his business empire is less complex than the media portrays, asserting that the American public was aware of the scale of his business ventures during the election.\n\n\"This is a very routine thing,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \"It's not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal, the business.\"\n\nThe president-elect postponed a previously scheduled press conference set for December 15, where he was to discuss his plans for separating himself from his hotel and golf course empire before his inauguration. He now plans to hold a press conference in early January.\n\n\"It's a much bigger business than anyone thought. It's a great business, but I'm going to have nothing to do with it,\" Trump said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump emphasized that he is not legally obligated to separate himself from his business, but he wishes to do so in order to focus on the country.\n\n\"But when I ran, people knew I have a very big business,\" he said. \"They elected me, I guess, partially for that reason. So I think that's going to work out very easily. It's actually a very simple situation. It's not a big deal.\"\n\nThe Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments, remains a topic of debate among scholars. The clause may still pose issues for Trump, even if he separates himself from his business, as he has announced plans to hand control to his adult sons.\n\nTrump was accompanied by legendary boxing promoter Don King during the press briefing. He is currently holding meetings at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida this week.",
    " Title: Republicans Launch Oversight Hearings on Obamacare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the government shutdown comes to an end, the battle over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, continues. One of the main venues for this battle is oversight hearings, starting next week, with tough questions about the problems plaguing the health care exchanges' website.\n\nRep. Fred Upton (R-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has called for officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the issues at a hearing scheduled for next Thursday. He is also requesting records of their communications with website contractors regarding the site's launch and the problems users have faced.\n\nSimilarly, the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, last week wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius demanding information about the rollout problems. He was joined by Sen. Lamar Alexander, the ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health, education, labor, and pensions.\n\nOne of the main issues with the healthcare.gov website has been the inability for some users to log in. A senior administration official told CNN that some users, especially those who signed up \"early on,\" have been experiencing trouble logging in, but the administration is working on a solution. There has also been conflicting information about whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch.\n\nDuring a tour to promote Obamacare, Secretary Sebelius acknowledged the website's rocky launch but emphasized that improvements are being made. However, some Republicans have called for Sebelius to resign, with Sen. Pat Roberts stating, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nDespite the calls for her resignation, Sebelius maintains the support of President Obama. When asked about accountability for the website's problems, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney replied, \"The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work, fixing the problems that need to be fixed.\"\n\nCarney focused instead on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to, stating, \"The result will be millions of Americans who have insurance who did not have it before.\"\n\nFormer White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, while not naming names, suggested that those responsible for the website's problems should be held accountable.\n\nAs the public's attention shifts from the shutdown to the problems with enrolling in the exchanges, part of the emerging Republican message is that the website issues reflect broader problems with the law overall. Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana stated, \"I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing issues, a spokeswoman for Sebelius maintains that the online enrollment process is proceeding. Joanne Peters stated, \"While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one, it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options.\"",
    " Title: Intensified Conflict in Gaza Strip: Ceasefire Broken as Israel Accuses Hamas of Capturing Soldier\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Gaza Strip has seen an escalation in fighting after a truce brokered by the United States and the United Nations was allegedly violated by both Israel and Hamas. The ceasefire, which was set to commence on July 17 and last for three days, was aimed at halting the ongoing conflict that entered its 26th day on July 18.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll in Israeli airstrikes, ground operations, and naval bombardments has reached over 1,600, according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qedra. Israel has reported over 60 military casualties and three civilian deaths in their battle against militants who have launched over 3,000 rockets and infiltrated through underground tunnels.\n\nIsrael accuses militants of using Gaza civilians as human shields by positioning rocket launchers and weapons caches in or near homes, mosques, hospitals, and schools. The Israeli military reported carrying out approximately 200 additional strikes since the ceasefire unraveled, bringing the total number of strikes to over 4,500 since the conflict began on July 8.\n\nIn response to the intensifying violence, the U.S. House and Senate approved $225 million in emergency funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense system on July 18. The military reports that Iron Dome has intercepted 549 rockets fired at urban areas, including three on July 18.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have demanded the release of the captured Israeli soldier and blamed Hamas for the resumption of violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of breaking the ceasefire by attacking Israeli forces an hour after the truce began, resulting in the death of two soldiers and the suspected capture of a third, identified as Hadar Goldin, 23.\n\nIsraeli army spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner stated that troops destroying a tunnel were attacked by militants, suggesting that Goldin may have been taken back through the tunnel. Goldin's father, Simcha, a professor of Judaic Studies at Tel Aviv University, expressed hope that the army would continue their efforts to locate and rescue his son.\n\nHamas's military wing, the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, denied capturing an Israeli soldier. In a statement on their website, they reported that Israeli ground forces entered Rafah at 2 a.m. on July 18, and a gunfight that broke out about 7 a.m. continued after the ceasefire took effect. The Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades stated they have no information about the missing Israeli soldier, his whereabouts, or the circumstances of his disappearance.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, who helped arrange the ceasefire, condemned the killing of the Israeli soldiers and the suspected abduction of another as an \"outrageous violation\" of the truce. Israel has called for Hamas to be disarmed under any agreement, while Hamas demands the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian embargo on the Gaza Strip.\n\nEgypt's Foreign Ministry has stated that the invitation for negotiations in Cairo, involving delegations from Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the U.S., still stands, though there is no indication that any talks will be held at this time. Hamas's allies, Turkey and Qatar, were also involved in the talks that led up to the truce announcement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been in contact with both countries since news of the missing Israeli soldier broke, according to a U.S. official who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the talks.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Releases First Phase of Open Payments Program Data\n\nThe Obama administration has released the initial phase of the Open Payments program, a transparency initiative mandated by the health care law, which discloses consulting fees, grants, travel expenses, and other gifts that pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers paid to American doctors and teaching hospitals from August 2013 to December 2013. The data, totaling $3.5 billion, involves more than 546,000 physicians and 1,360 teaching hospitals.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that the reports will be published annually, with the subsequent reports including 12 months of data. Beginning in June, additional data and tools will be added to provide a more detailed look into the industry's financial arrangements.\n\nCMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner stated, \"CMS is committed to transparency, and this is an opportunity for the public to learn about the relationships among health care providers, and pharmaceutical and device companies.\"\n\nThe move is being praised by public interest groups as a step towards transparency, as concerns have been raised about the potential influence of financial relationships on doctors' prescribing behavior. However, some have expressed concerns about the completeness and accuracy of the data, with some physicians finding they had been linked to payments that went to doctors with the same name.\n\nCMS emphasized that the payments do not necessarily imply wrongdoing on the part of doctors and teaching hospitals, and that they did not parse out which payments may be beneficial or imply underhanded dealing. Shantanu Agrawal, deputy administrator and director of CMS's Center for Program Integrity, stated, \"We are simply making the data available to the public.\"\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the main lobby group for insurers, expressed concern about the payments, stating that while not nefarious in every case, they are a symbol of misaligned incentives in the health care system. AHIP spokesman Brendan Buck said, \"While most health care stakeholders are working together to find ways to lower costs, drugmakers remain focused on strategies to keep them inflated.\"\n\nApproximately 40 percent of the records do not name the individuals involved in the payments, at least for now, as parties cross-check the information. The agency did not publish more than 190,000 payments, which are stipulated by law to be withheld for four years or until the product at hand is approved by the FDA.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, spearheaded the movement to release the data through his Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In an op-ed for the Des Moines Register, Mr. Grassley acknowledged the database's incompleteness and the ongoing debate around the data's release. He wrote, \"The doctors rightly point out that such payments are perfectly legal, unlike kickbacks to steer prescribers toward certain drugs. But studies have shown that exposure to a prescription drug on the lecture circuit or in the lab leads to more prescriptions for that drug, whether the doctor feels influenced or not.\"",
    " Title: University of Chicago Professor Reinstated After Controversial Remarks on Police Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, the University of Chicago has reinstated Harold Uhlig, the head of the Journal of Political Economy, following a 10-day investigation into controversial remarks he made regarding police reform. The controversy arose when Uhlig tweeted that the Black Lives Matter movement, in supporting the #defundthepolice movement, had \"torpedoed itself.\" He suggested that instead of defunding, police should be trained better.\n\nHundreds of people signed a petition demanding Uhlig's resignation, including prominent economists such as Janet Yellen and Paul Krugman. Krugman labeled Uhlig as \"another privileged white man who evidently can't control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.\"\n\nHowever, Robby Soave, a senior editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 magazine who covers the new \"woke\" protests, argues that Uhlig was not belittling anyone's concerns. \"There was nothing racist or discriminatory in how he said it,\" Soave said. \"But because he has some different views from the protesters, he must be a racist.\"\n\nUhlig was placed on leave by the journal he ran, but the university's investigation found \"no basis\" for taking away his job.\n\nThe incident is part of a larger trend where individuals are being targeted and silenced for expressing views that differ from the current social and political climate. David Shor, an analyst at Democratic polling firm Civis Analytics, was attacked after tweeting a study that concluded \"race riots reduced Democratic vote share.\" Shor was fired despite issuing a groveling apology.\n\nSoave points out, \"There's a cruel streak in activism that says, 'If you disagree with me\u2026you have no right to speak.'\" He further explains, \"It just takes one employee at one company, to say, 'Here's the law that protects my rights to feel safe and comfortable in this workplace. If you're not making me feel safe and comfortable, I'm going to get you in trouble.'\"\n\nSimilar incidents have occurred in various industries, with individuals being fired or forced out for expressing unpopular opinions. A Boeing executive was forced out for opposing women's service in the military\u201430 years ago. A Los Angeles soccer team fired a player because his wife posted racist comments. Michigan State pushed out a physicist when a twitter mob from its \"Graduate Employees Union\" labeled him a \"scientific racist.\"\n\nIn a separate incident, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is being labeled as \"transphobic\" for her comments on gender and trans issues. Despite facing backlash, Rowling has remained vocal, tweeting, \"It is not hate to speak the truth.\"\n\nThe University of Chicago's decision to reinstate Uhlig has been hailed as a victory for free speech. Soave concludes, \"The solution is to challenge these people. We just have to speak up.\"",
    " Title: Challenges in Building a Coalition Against ISIS: Turkey-Russia Tensions Highlight Complexities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent shoot-down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey, a member of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS), underscores the complexities and challenges in building a broad, effective alliance to destroy IS. Over a year since President Obama announced the creation of a coalition of more than 50 countries to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" IS, there remains no unified alliance of major powers.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French President, who was at the White House on Tuesday and will be in Russia on Friday, has made building a coalition his priority in the wake of the Paris attacks. However, the same challenge persists: the major players deeply mistrust one another's intentions and visions for a post-Islamic State Syria.\n\nBarry Strauss, a military historian at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, comments, \"It was never going to be easy to build a coalition against ISIS, given the complicated relations and competing alliances around the Syrian conflict. But clearly, an event of this seriousness between Russia and Turkey will only make that effort more difficult.\"\n\nTurkey and Russia exemplify the complex and often contradictory motives that Mr. Hollande will try to manage. The anti-IS coalition, supposedly, shares similar aims with Turkey's: the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as a key step toward reducing IS's allure for Syrian Sunnis. However, it took months of sustained diplomatic effort for the United States to bring Turkey on board. Even now, the differences between the US and Turkey remain pronounced.\n\nFrom the US perspective, perhaps the most effective fighters against IS have been Syrian and Iraqi Kurds \u2013 so much so that the US has sent special operations forces to the region to help them. However, Turkey has a large Kurdish population and worries that empowering Kurds anywhere in the region might create trouble at home.\n\nIn fact, Turkey has been \"friendlier towards ISIS than Russia\" because of Turkey's satisfaction with the setbacks that IS has dealt Syria's Kurdish rebels.\n\nSimilarly, many countries in the region \"find ISIS useful to have around and are in no rush to get rid of it\" because it is virulently anti-Shiite, Professor Strauss notes. In that way, IS acts \"as a counterbalance to Iran and the Shiite parties in the region.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia says it entered the Syrian conflict to defeat Syria's \"terrorists,\" but analysts say its airstrikes in Syria have focused on Assad's opponents. Only about a quarter have been against IS, experts say.\n\nGiven these reasons, getting Turkey and Russia on the same page for destroying IS \u2013 a priority for neither \u2013 was always going to be difficult. After the Russian jet shoot-down, the task will be even harder when Hollande meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.\n\nMr. Putin called the downing of the Russian jet a \"stab in the back\" carried out by \"accomplices of terrorists,\" and he warned that the perpetrators of the \"crime\" will face \"serious consequences.\"\n\nRussia canceled Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to Turkey on Wednesday, while NATO called an emergency meeting of alliance ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday's incident was the first shoot-down of a Russian aircraft by a NATO country since the 1950s, officials said.\n\nRussia insists the fighter jet did not stray outside Syria, while Turkish officials said the jet was warned 10 times to turn back from its trajectory into Turkish airspace. President Obama called on Russia, Turkey, and NATO countries to \"discourage any escalation,\" but also asserted that \"Turkey, like every country, has the right to defend its territory and its airspace.\"\n\nRussia is likely to view the aftermath of the incident as validation that all groups arrayed against Assad are terrorists. A video released following the shoot-down shows Syrian Turkmen rebels claiming to have shot dead two Russian pilots as they parachuted to the ground.\n\nA separate incident further illustrates the difficulty of building a united anti-IS coalition that includes Russia. A group of Syrian rebels armed by the US claims to have damaged a Russian military helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Syrian government-held territory.\n\nYet Strauss says perhaps the more formidable impediment to an effective coalition is the widespread ambiguity in the region toward the Islamic State. The region's Sunni powers \"may worry about ISIS in the long term, but to some extent they see its usefulness in the short term,\" he says. That calculation does not fit with Western powers that \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 want to see IS's demise \"sooner rather than later.\"",
    " Title: Mike Pence Faces Protests, Low Turnout at Patrick Henry College Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nPURCELLVILLE, Va. \u2014 Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence faced protests and a low turnout during a stump speech at Patrick Henry College on Saturday, a Christian college with a history of anti-Trump sentiment. Students protested outside, while inside students stood in silent protest until they were ejected mid-speech.\n\nThe protests and poor attendance at the speech illustrate the challenges that Donald Trump has in appealing to evangelical Christians, especially younger ones, who are turned off by his tone, his campaign ideas, and his personal history, and are not assuaged by his choice of Pence for his running mate.\n\n\"The PHC student body as a whole is very anti-Trump. A lot of them say, 'I don't like him but I'm going to turn up my nose and vote for him because I like Hillary even less,'\" said Sebastian Lopez, a junior studying political theory at the school who was protesting the speech, holding a sign for hours outside in the blazing mid-day sun.\n\n\"I don't think that Mike Pence is a bad person, but I think he has made an alliance with someone who is completely unacceptable from a libertarian, conservative, or progressive standpoint,\" added Christian McGuire, a junior at Patrick Henry College studying American politics who was also demonstrating against Pence. McGuire estimated 75 percent of the student body opposed Trump.\n\nPence's visit is not the first misstep by the Trump campaign in Virginia. Donald Trump flubbed his speech in Northern Virginia earlier this month when he lectured the affluent locals in the audience as if they were the Rust Belt\u2014 \"You're doing lousy over here,\" he remarked\u2014and then listed factory closures in far-flung areas of the state that were hours away, as well as a plant that closed in North Carolina.\n\nPatrick Henry College is located in Loudoun County, the affluent swing district an hour from Washington, D.C., that voted for Bush twice, and then Obama twice. It's as close to a must-win county as it gets.\n\nSo it fell to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2014again\u2014to sweep up after his boss's mistakes.\n\n\"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican\u2014in that order,\" said Pence, playing to the audience.\n\nBut locals weren't interested in hearing what he had to say. When Marco Rubio visited in February during the Republican primaries, students and local residents crammed into the room, filling the bleachers, the gymnasium floor, and the balconies above to get a glimpse of the presidential candidate. The road outside the college was jam-packed. Parking was a nightmare.\n\nAn enthusiastic Students for Rubio group existed during the primaries. To this day, there is no pro-Trump group on campus.\n\n\"There are certainly students who support Trump, though most are not enthusiastic. He was rarely the first choice in such a crowded primary field,\" said Tim Kocher, a spokesman for the Patrick Henry College Republicans. \"I believe Trump has a solid base of support around 15-20%, but many students simply have not made up their minds as far as the presidential race goes.\"\n\nWhen Pence visited Saturday, the room was half-empty\u2014a whole set of retractable bleachers sat empty and discarded near the stage; no admiring crowds leaned over the balcony to get a better look at the politician; parking was a breeze. This lackluster turnout took place at a school which in fall 2015 registered just 294 students, yet had about as many White House interns during the Bush administration as Georgetown University, with its nearly 18,000 students.\n\n\"I'm a B-list Republican celebrity,\" Pence said self-deprecatingly, as he thanked attendees for showing up on a beautiful, cloudless Saturday afternoon. It was funny because it was kind of sad, and it was sad because it was kind of true.\n\nPence also spoke as if he did not quite understand whose ticket he was on. \"We believe in free trade,\" he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign slamming international trade. The governor also slammed Hillary Clinton's plan to tax the rich, as if the Republican nominee had not taken aim at Wall Street during his populist run for the White House. Americans are \"tired of politicians who divide our country to unite their support,\" he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign that regularly disparaged Muslims, foreigners, and women.\n\nAs if to bolster this point, a group of protesters critical of Trump's rhetoric on Islam revealed their T-shirts during Pence's speech, engaging in a silent protest of the Republican ticket as they were slowly escorted out.\n\nEven the students who supported the Trump-Pence ticket seemed to be doing so with an air of resignation, buoyed only by the threat they believe Hillary Clinton poses to the country.\n\nSarah Roberts, a student at the college who attended the speech, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"I haven't done the research to be, like, 'Woo-hoo,' but he's better than the alternative.\"\n\n\"Our options are a little limited, so we're going to have to choose between worse and worse,\" said another student carrying a Trump-Pence sign. \"It's a very conservative school, one of the most conservative schools in the nation\u2026 a lot of people don't really believe he's very conservative.\"\n\nMeanwhile, outside Patrick Henry College, nearly 20 students and alumni from the predominantly conservative school demonstrated against Pence and Trump, to make the point that the Christian college did not support the Republican ticket.\n\n\"I don't want my school, and therefore my name, associated with [Trump],\" said Erin Lester, an alumni of the school. \"It's known for being a conservative school\u2026 and I don't want people to assume that because it's a conservative school, that we're Trump's dupes, basically.\"\n\nThe protests for the swing area of Loudoun County continued out in the street outside Patrick Henry College's main entrance, where students held signs reading \"PHC is Not Trump Country,\" \"Immigrants Make America Great,\" and \"For Christ and Liberty, Not Bigotry And Idiocy.\"\n\nSome locals passed, honking in support. Eventually, a car drove by, and its angry occupant flipped the bird, yelling \"TRUMP!\"",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Apologizes for Past Native American Heritage Claims at Iowa Tribal Forum\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren offered a public apology on Monday to Native Americans over her past claims of tribal heritage during a forum on Native American issues in Sioux City, Iowa. The Massachusetts senator acknowledged her mistakes and expressed regret for any harm caused.\n\nThe forum, held at the Orpheum Theatre, was the first day of the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum. Warren's apology was a significant step in addressing the fallout from her past claims of tribal ancestry, which had been a political liability for her campaign.\n\nLast year, Warren released a DNA analysis that showed evidence of a tribal ancestor as far as 10 generations back, but the Cherokee Nation and other Native Americans criticized her for attributing tribal membership to genetics. Warren had previously apologized privately to the Cherokee Nation and had addressed her regret before Monday's appearance.\n\nWarren's detailed policy agenda to help Native Americans, which she released last week, helped secure a warm reception from attendees at the tribal forum. She fielded questions about her proposals, which include a legislative change for a Supreme Court ruling that impedes tribal governments' ability to prosecute crimes committed on tribal lands by those who don't belong to a tribe.\n\nNew Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland, who last year became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress, introduced Warren on Monday after endorsing her presidential campaign last month. Haaland lamented that Warren's ancestry has attracted outsized attention when President Donald Trump faces his own charges of racism.\n\nAttendees at the forum praised Warren's remarks, with some expressing appreciation for her efforts to address her past mistakes. Manny Iron Hawk, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in South Dakota, said Warren \"did excellent\" in her Monday appearance. However, he noted that he had hoped to talk to Warren about tribal governance issues but she left too quickly for him to catch her.\n\nOther attendees, such as Snuffy Main, a member of the Gros Ventre Tribe of Montana, did not think Warren needed to continue apologizing for claiming Native American heritage. Main said he liked what Warren had to say about making sure the country honors its promises and treaties with tribes.\n\nGary Funmaker, a Republican who used to work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said Warren had \"good energy\" and he didn't see much need for further apology.\n\nLater on Monday, Warren campaigned in Minnesota, a state that Trump hopes to take out of Democrats' column next year. The senator drew her largest crowd yet - 12,000 people, according to her campaign - to an outdoor rally at Macalester College, a private liberal arts school in St. Paul.\n\nWarren told the crowd, \"I don't want a government that works for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for our families.\" The Associated Press and Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report.",
    " Title: FBI Under Scrutiny for Inaction on Florida School Shooting Tip\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is facing mounting pressure over its failure to act on a tip that the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, might carry out an attack.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott has called for the resignation of FBI Director Christopher Wray, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a review, lamenting the FBI's \"failures.\" Some of those close to the 17 victims of Wednesday's shooting have also expressed dismay at the FBI's actions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump met with survivors of the attack on Friday, visiting a hospital and later the local sheriff's office, praising their response to the tragedy. \"What a great job you've done,\" Mr. Trump told law enforcement officials, adding, \"I hope you get credit for it because believe me, you deserve it.\"\n\nNikolas Cruz, 19, has confessed to the attack and has been charged with 17 counts of murder. The shooting was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012 and has reignited debates about gun control, with many students from the school weighing in.\n\nThe FBI admitted it did not properly follow up on a warning about Cruz on January 5, when a person close to the suspect contacted the FBI tipline to provide information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting. The FBI stated that the information should have been assessed as a potential threat to life and passed on to the Miami field office, but that \"we have determined these protocols were not followed.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau was \"still investigating the facts\" and was committed to \"getting to the bottom of what happened.\" He added, \"We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy.\"\n\nThe January 5 tip was not the only information the FBI received about Nikolas Cruz. In September, a Mississippi man reported a disturbing comment left on a YouTube video by a user called \"nikolas cruz\" which said, \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" The FBI conducted checks at the time but were unable to identify the person behind the comment.\n\nQuestions are also being asked about how local police responded to concerns about Nikolas Cruz. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said his office had received 20 \"calls for service\" about him. Each one would be scrutinized, he said, without going into detail about the nature of the calls.\n\nGovernor Scott said in a statement that \"the FBI's failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable.\" He said that an apology would never give families \"the answers they desperately need\" and said that Mr. Wray had to resign.\n\nAt a funeral for 18-year-old victim Meadow Pollack, Jeff Richman, a family friend, questioned the value of the FBI's apology. \"The FBI apologized? Tell that to families,\" he told Reuters news agency.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the FBI's \"failures\" had led to \"tragic consequences,\" and announced a review at the justice department and FBI into how \"indications of potential violence\" are responded to.\n\nThe FBI has been criticized before for being aware of a possible threat and then failing to thwart an attack. The gunman of the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas was known to the FBI, as was one of the two brothers behind the deadly Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and the gunman who killed 49 people in a gay club in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 was on the FBI's radar.\n\nIn 2016, the FBI received about 1,300 tips a day through its website, which is staffed around the clock by two dozen people. In addition to online tips, FBI field offices receive dozens of calls. About 100 of the tips are considered \"actionable.\"\n\nMr. Cruz had been expelled from the school he has confessed to attacking, and some students said they had previously joked he would one day \"shoot up the school.\" One former schoolmate, Chad Williams, said Mr. Cruz was an \"outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns.\" His interest in weapons was apparent on his social media profiles, which the Broward County sheriff said were \"very, very disturbing.\" Mr. Cruz had reportedly been treated for mental health issues at a clinic.",
    " Title: Ford's Testimony in Kavanaugh Hearing: A Divisive yet Compelling Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Christine Blasey Ford, in a dramatic and emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, detailed her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Ford, who was widely praised for her credible and brave account, had never appeared on camera before the hearing and was only depicted in news media reports with a grainy photo.\n\nThousands of conservatives took to social media to accuse Ford of lying to bring down Kavanaugh, who angrily and tearfully denied her accusations in a day of dramatic, high-stakes testimony. However, both Ford and Kavanaugh were not personally attacked by Republican senators, who depicted her testimony as part of a partisan attack orchestrated by Democrats.\n\nDespite the political divide, many prominent conservatives praised Ford for her sincerity and credibility. Alice Stewart, a conservative strategist who has worked on several Republican presidential campaigns, said, \"Dr. Ford comes across as a credible person who has suffered the serious emotional impact of a disturbing incident in her teens.\"\n\nMoira Donegan, a writer and prominent voice in the #MeToo movement, said Ford struck a chord among American women. \"So many women around the country were watching it together in rooms and texting one another about what they were seeing, identifying with her,\" Donegan said.\n\nWhile many Republicans believed Ford was honestly recounting what happened to her, they took the view that it was a case of mistaken identity. The Republican Party posted online videos of women supporting Kavanaugh throughout Ford's testimony.\n\nFord, a 51-year-old psychology professor from California, began her appearance by asking for a cup of coffee, her jaw tight with nerves. Her voice cracked at times as she gave an emotional account of the alleged assault in 1982. A GoFundMe page to support Ford and pay for her security and legal expenses quickly doubled its fundraising total after it was mentioned during the hearing.\n\nRAINN, a group that provides a support hotline for victims of sexual assault and crimes, said it saw a 147 percent increase above the normal volume of people reaching out for help. An analysis of social media sentiment conducted by the Ipsos polling firm using an artificial intelligence prototype found that positive sentiment directed toward Ford increased each time she spoke.\n\nKathleen Pierman, 66, who watched the testimony at home, was convinced by Ford's testimony. \"She didn't seem in it for gain,\" Pierman said, adding that she found Kavanaugh more convincing than she expected but said confirming him would be a \"huge mistake\" because \"no one will trust the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThree political scientists who specialize in voting behavior and political psychology told AP they expected Ford's testimony to galvanize female Democratic voters to vote in November.",
    " Title: The Paradox of Prosperity: America's Declining Social Ties and the Rise of Loneliness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of New York City, the American flag stands tall against the backdrop of Times Square, a symbol of a nation that, by most economic measures, is thriving. Unemployment is at an all-time low, wages are on the rise, and the stock market is booming. Yet, a paradox persists: despite these positive economic indicators, Americans are reporting decreasing levels of happiness and rising levels of loneliness.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a United Nations initiative, has attributed this paradox to the weakening of social support networks in the United States. This decline in social connections can be seen in various aspects of American society, from the shrinking size of households to the decline in marriage rates, church attendance, and neighborliness.\n\nMarriage, for instance, has significantly decreased over the past few decades. In 2000, 55% of 25- to 34-year-olds were married, with only 34% never married. Today, never-married individuals are nearly on par with married individuals in terms of population. The average number of people per household has also decreased from 3.33 in 1960 to 2.57 today, a seemingly small change that, when multiplied across an entire kin network, results in a dramatic shrinking of social connections.\n\nSurveys show a marked increase in loneliness, with progressive generational declines in the art of friendship. On average, Americans have one fewer close friend today than a generation ago. Many men report having no close friendships, while the youngest Americans, the most prolific users of social media, are socializing the least \"irl.\"\n\nDespite America's reputation as a God-bothering nation, church attendance has been consistently declining over the past few decades. Barna now estimates that the population of \"unchurched\" people, 43%, has exceeded the population of active churchgoers.\n\nOne city that buckes this trend is Salt Lake City, Utah. With a hardy, respected religious institution at its heart, the culture of Utah is infused with the spirit created by a coherent religious culture that, despite being a minority faith in the country, has the solidarity of a close-knit community. In more reliable estimates, Salt Lake City is tied with Chattanooga for the country's most churched city.\n\nThe decline in neighborliness is another concerning trend. Fewer Americans know their next-door neighbors, and fewer still regularly interact with them. This decline in everyday charity and philanthropy, as well as declines in civic and ethnic organizations, can be seen as the depletion and disappearance of a social treasury.\n\nThis depletion of the social treasury is not easily amenable to political policy. Until Utah Senator Mike Lee used his position on the Joint Economic Committee to pioneer a social-capital index, it was barely visible to policymakers.\n\nPolitics, however, has become one of the only arenas in which Americans can collectively discuss the quality of their social relations and their sense of morality. As a result, politicians will at least have to learn to address an America that is wealthier and lonelier, that has higher standards of living but lives marked by quiet desperation, that works hard but doesn't know why anymore.\n\nThis paradox of prosperity and loneliness is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding and a collective effort to address. It is a reminder that, while economic indicators can provide valuable insights, they do not capture the full picture of a society's well-being.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Faces Legal Challenges and Ongoing Scrutiny Amidst Controversial Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past week, the Trump administration has faced a series of legal challenges and public scrutiny, with the revised travel ban, the firing of FBI Director James Comey, and ongoing investigations into potential Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump administration attorneys will appear before a federal appeals court in Seattle to argue against a judge's ruling that blocked the implementation of the revised travel ban. The administration contends that the policy is a vital component of a strategy to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country.\n\nMeanwhile, associates of James Comey, the former FBI director, believe that his first comments on his termination would likely come in an open session before Congress. Comey declined an invitation to speak to a closed session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday and was replaced on a panel testifying before that committee last Thursday by his temporary replacement, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner has expressed a desire for Comey to testify in a public hearing about his firing. \"I think Jim Comey deserves his chance to lay out to the American public his side of the facts,\" Warner told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley defended President Trump's firing of James Comey, stating that he can \"fire anyone he wants.\" Haley added that the criticism of Trump stems from discomfort with his propensity to act on his decisions.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Russia likely sees Trump's firing of Comey as \"another victory on the scoreboard for them.\" Clapper noted that the removal of the lead of the investigation about potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has been removed.\n\nThe U.S. believes the ballistic missile North Korea launched on Saturday was a KN-17 medium range missile and not a new intermediate range missile, as had been speculated. The launch marked the first successful test of the missile, three previous launches in April had ended in failure.\n\nIn other news, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly warned senior staff to stop trying to secretly slip news articles to President Trump. The administration is also facing ongoing investigations into potential Russian interference in the 2016 election and the firing of James Comey.\n\nThe ongoing legal challenges and investigations have raised questions about the credibility of the White House and the president himself, as his words and actions continue to be scrutinized by the public and the media. The administration's policies and decisions are being closely monitored by federal judges, members of Congress, and international leaders, adding to the pressure on the president and his administration.",
    " Title: AOC Speaks Out on Congressional Pay Raise, Criticizes Perceived Hypocrisy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expressed her views on the potential $4,500 pay raise for members of Congress, which has not been implemented in the past nine years. The proposed increase has sparked concerns among Democrats in vulnerable states regarding its political implications during the next election.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who currently earns $174,000 per year, discussed the possibility of Congress not receiving the pay raise with Fox News' Chad Pergram on Monday. She argued that the lack of cost-of-living adjustments for members of Congress contributes to the pressure on them to turn to lobbying firms or cash in on their services after leaving office.\n\n\"You know, it may not be politically popular to say, but honestly, this is why there\u2019s so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on members' service after people leave because, precisely of this issue,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nShe further stated that voting against pay increases might be perceived as a positive move, but it is, in her opinion, a vote against a cost-of-living adjustment. Ocasio-Cortez argued that members of Congress, like retail workers, should receive cost-of-living increases to accommodate for economic changes.\n\n\"So, you can vote against a cost-of-living adjustment all you want, and it\u2019ll look good on its surface, but it will, every cost-of-living adjustment that gets bypassed, is voting to increase the pressure to exploit loopholes and legal loopholes to kind of lean on other ways to enrich oneself through service,\" Ocasio-Cortez concluded.\n\nThe congresswoman's comments highlight her stance on the importance of cost-of-living adjustments for all workers, including members of Congress, and her concern about the potential political implications of such adjustments.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Condemns Sandra Bland's Arrest as \"Police Abuse,\" Calls for Police Reform\n\nIn a forceful statement, Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced the conduct of the officer involved in the arrest of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old African American woman who died in police custody in a small Texas town last week. The cause of death was initially ruled a suicide, but cell phone footage later revealed that Bland had yelled during the arrest that the officer had slammed her head on the ground.\n\nSanders, the only presidential candidate to speak publicly about Bland's death, addressed the issue during a speech in Houston on Sunday. He stated, \"It is unacceptable that police officers beat up people or kill people. If they do that, they have got to be held accountable.\"\n\nFollowing a tense encounter with Black Lives Matter activists at the Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix on Saturday, Sanders added a passage to his stump speech in Houston, referencing Bland's death. This reference drew the longest and loudest applause from the crowd.\n\nThe release of dashcam video showing the officer, who had pulled Bland over for a minor traffic infraction, open Bland's driver-side door and threaten to \"light her up\" with his taser if she did not stop smoking a cigarette and exit the vehicle, prompted Sanders to release a statement Tuesday condemning the arrest. He described the video as showing \"totally outrageous police behavior.\"\n\nTwo Texas state lawmakers have already declared Bland's arrest unlawful, but neither of the two Texas presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Governor Rick Perry, have commented on Bland's case. Sanders is the only presidential candidate to mention Bland on the campaign trail, so far. Activists have utilized the #SayHerName hashtag on social media to draw attention to the Bland case.",
    " Title: The Need for a Comprehensive Strategy in Syria: A Call for Long-Term Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Syrian conflict, now in its sixth year, has been a complex and devastating issue for the international community. While President Barack Obama's reluctance to engage in Syria's civil war is understandable, the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime last year, which Obama had previously labeled a \"red line,\" has raised questions about the credibility of the U.S. and the effectiveness of deterrence.\n\nIn an article published by the Brookings Institution, Michael O' Hanlon, a senior fellow and author, argues that the U.S. needs a long-term strategy for Syria, rather than relying on short-term, tactical responses. O' Hanlon suggests that limited military action, such as cruise-missile strikes, would achieve only limited effects and would not meaningfully affect the trajectory of the conflict.\n\nInstead, O' Hanlon proposes an integrated strategy for ending the war that envisions a future political settlement among the belligerents. This strategy would require time, potentially involving the deployment of 10,000 or more U.S. troops to help implement any peace deal that may be reached in the future. The international community, including NATO, Arab League, and other Islamic countries, would need to be involved in a Bosnia-style peace implementation force.\n\nO' Hanlon acknowledges that such a mission would be more dangerous for peacekeeping troops than was Bosnia, given the widespread presence of extremists. However, the alternative, he argues, is for Syria to become a new Somalia, offering sanctuaries to terrorists and wreaking instability across the Middle East.\n\nO' Hanlon's article highlights the need for a long-term strategy that goes beyond immediate responses to the latest tragedy in Syria. The international community, including the U.S., needs to clarify that while the removal of President Bashar Assad is still a goal, this is not a war against his fellow Alawites. Any future political framework for Syria must protect all groups, including minorities, and may require autonomous zones in a confederal arrangement.\n\nIn conclusion, O' Hanlon's article underscores the importance of a comprehensive strategy for Syria that goes beyond short-term tactical moves and addresses the complex political, social, and security challenges in the region. While such a strategy will not be risk- or cost-free, it will be a far less daunting effort than either Iraq or Afghanistan, even if it will be substantially harder than launching a few cruise missiles. The U.S. and the international community need to work together to develop, define, and gain international consensus for such a strategy, and to gain support for it at home and abroad.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Challenges Constitutionality of Defense of Marriage Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) faced scrutiny at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, as justices expressed doubts about the law's constitutionality, which bans same-sex married couples from receiving federal benefits.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who has been a key swing vote on similar issues, seemed to lean towards siding with the four liberal justices expected to vote for the overturn of the 17-year-old law. However, Kennedy's concerns appeared to focus on the traditional right of states to define marriage, rather than on fairness for gay couples.\n\nPaul Clement, the sole lawyer arguing for the constitutionality of the 1996 law, was retained by Republican leaders in the House after President Barack Obama decided in 2011 that the Justice Department would no longer defend the statute. Clement argued that Congress's interest in passing the law was preserving the uniform treatment of couples in various states, as some states were considering allowing same-sex marriages.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, however, argued that Congress wasn't preserving tradition but departing from it by entering the marriage issue. She pointed out that the foray into the issue in 1996 was so unusual that it \"sent up a pretty big red flag.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on the constitutionality of DOMA could wipe the law from the books and provide federal benefits to same-sex married couples, but it may not declare that all government distinctions based on sexual orientation be subject to \"heightened scrutiny\" by the courts.\n\nThe case was brought by Edith Windsor, a New York woman who was forced to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes after her same-sex spouse died in 2009. If the couple had been heterosexual, no tax would have been due, but under DOMA federal tax law treated the pair as unmarried.",
    " Title: Navy SEAL Trial Exposes Fractures Within Elite U.S. Special Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 The ongoing court-martial of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a 19-year Navy SEAL veteran and Bronze Star recipient, has provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one of the military's most secretive and revered forces. The trial, which has been unfolding at Naval Base San Diego, has laid bare challenges among U.S. special forces and could have long-term implications for the elite group.\n\nGallagher is charged with murder, attempted murder, and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline for allegedly stabbing a wounded Islamic State captive in his care and shooting civilians in Iraq in 2017. The jury, composed of mostly combat Marines, will decide his fate.\n\nThe trial has revealed a WhatsApp group chat among a select few members of Gallagher's Alpha platoon, dubbed \"The Sewing Circle.\" The group's purpose was to discuss alleged war crimes committed by their chief, Gallagher. The chat's name and the nature of its discussions were surprising, given that Gallagher is a decorated sniper and medic.\n\nThe trial has sparked a fierce debate within the SEAL community, pitting veterans against each other. The case has raised questions about brotherhood, morality, and loyalty within the SEAL community. Gary Solis, a former military judge and Marine Corps prosecutor who teaches law at Georgetown, stated, \"SEALs, it seems to me, have been seeing themselves as God-like on the battlefield, and there is a real danger in taking that view of one's unit or one's self.\"\n\nThe trial has also highlighted the challenges faced by military courts in prosecuting alleged war crimes. The lead prosecutor was removed after allegedly tracking the defense team's emails to find a news leak, and the lead investigator acknowledged making mistakes.\n\nClosing arguments are expected Monday, and the jury will weigh the evidence presented over the past two weeks. Gallagher's accusers claim he fatally stabbed the war prisoner as a trophy kill, while his defense argues that the boy died from wounds sustained in an airstrike and Gallagher is being falsely accused by junior SEALs trying to permanently oust a platoon chief they hate.\n\nThe trial has also shed light on the behavior of special warfare teams, prompting a review by the Navy's top commanders. The case has come to light as the United States increasingly relies on such troops, which make up only 2% of the military yet carry out most of its battles around the globe.\n\nOther special forces members are also on trial this year. A U.S. Navy SEAL pleaded guilty to hazing and assault charges for his role in the 2017 strangulation of a U.S. Army Green Beret in Africa. The scandals have raised concerns about the behavior of special warfare teams and their adherence to the rules of engagement.\n\nThe trial has shown the struggles of military courts in prosecuting alleged war crimes. The lead prosecutor was removed after allegedly tracking the defense team's emails to find a news leak, and the lead investigator acknowledged making mistakes.\n\nThe trial's outcome will likely have a significant impact on the SEAL community and could lead to changes in the behavior and conduct of special warfare teams. The case has exposed a darker side of the SEAL community, raising questions about the moral compass of its members and the culture that has been allowed to develop within the ranks.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue this week, with closing arguments and the jury's verdict imminent. The case has provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the SEAL community and could lead to changes in the behavior and conduct of special warfare teams.",
    " Title: FBI's Handling of Anti-Trump Dossier Raises Questions in Senate Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent Senate hearing, questions were raised about the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who compiled an anti-Trump dossier, and his company Orbis, as well as their ties to Fusion GPS. The dossier, which was considered important enough by then-FBI Director James Comey to be included in the final intelligence community report on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, has been a subject of controversy due to its unverified nature and the allegations it contains about then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pressed Comey on the relationship between Fusion GPS and the Russian intelligence apparatus, to which Comey responded evasively. When asked if he agreed that the preparation of the anti-Trump dossier by Fusion GPS would be interfering in the election if it were Russian-influenced, Comey declined to comment.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) expressed his frustration at the FBI's lack of response to his questions, citing a \"pattern of obstruction\" on matters related to Steele. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated that she does not currently have evidence of collusion between Trump associates and Russia during the campaign.\n\nA letter of complaint was filed with the Justice Department, alleging that Fusion GPS and its founder, former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). In response, attorney Joshua A. Levy, representing Fusion GPS, stated that the company complied with the law and was not required to register under FARA. He also denied allegations that Fusion GPS acted as an unregistered agent for Russian interests or lobbied against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nGrassley expressed concerns about the FBI's reliance on the dossier to justify the ongoing investigation, citing reports that the author of the dossier was paid, and that the payments extended to the sources and sub-sources. During the hearing, Grassley also criticized the FBI for providing materially inconsistent information and noted that Steele himself admitted in court that the dossier contains unverified claims.\n\nFurther details about Steele's work for Fusion GPS can be found in a British court document, which describes \"unsolicited intelligence\" and \"raw intelligence\" that needed to be analyzed and verified. Fox News has filed a formal request for copies of court documents with the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in London.",
    " Title: White House Immigration Policy Stalemate: Uncertainty and Lack of Clarity in Trump Administration's Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing saga of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has taken a dramatic turn, with the White House seemingly unable to find a clear path forward. The President's inconsistent messages and lack of a definitive stance have left many in a state of uncertainty, including members of Congress and the Dreamers themselves.\n\nIn February, President Trump described the Dreamers as \"absolutely incredible kids\" who deserved compassionate treatment. However, in September, he set a March 5 deadline for Congress to find a permanent solution for the program or face its termination. Two weeks ago, he promised a \"bill of love,\" but two days later, he rejected a bipartisan deal aimed at addressing the issue. On Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, the President reportedly reached an agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would have protected Dreamers and increased border security. Yet, he later reversed course, citing pressure from hard-line immigration advocates within his administration.\n\nOn Sunday, the President took to Twitter, criticizing Democrats for allegedly wanting \"illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.\" This shift in tone and policy direction has left many questioning the White House's intentions. As Senator Schumer put it, negotiating with the President is \"like negotiating with Jell-O.\"\n\nThis contrasts starkly with the 2013 government shutdown, initiated by Republican hard-liners who demanded the defunding of the Affordable Care Act. Then-President Obama, who maintained a clear stance against negotiating on this point, eventually prevailed.\n\nIn 2018, the White House is led by a President with no apparent principles beyond self-promotion and perceived \"wins.\" His apparent disinterest in the intricacies of governing has led to a lack of compromise from all parties involved, as stated by a Republican strategist who noted that the President's lack of convictions and policy knowledge emboldens opposing parties to take extreme positions.\n\nThe question remains: what does the White House truly want in terms of a resolution for the DACA issue? As the March 5 deadline approaches, the lack of clarity and consistency in the President's messages has left many in a state of uncertainty.",
    " Title: New York Times Editorial Sparks Controversy: U.S. Military Bases Named After Confederate Generals Celebrate White Supremacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial editorial published on Memorial Day weekend, The New York Times Editorial Board argued that U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals celebrate white supremacy. The piece, titled \"Why Does the U.S. Military Celebrate White Supremacy?\", called for the renaming of these bases to honor \"American heroes, not racist traitors.\"\n\nThe editorial highlighted Fort Benning, Georgia, as an example, noting that the military base honors Henry Lewis Benning, a Confederate general who advocated for the belief that African-Americans were not fully human and could not be trusted with full citizenship. The editorial referenced Benning's famous 1861 speech in Virginia, where he stated that his home state of Georgia had seceded from the Union to \"prevent the abolition of her slavery.\"\n\nThe editorial also pointed to another Georgia base named after Confederate general John Brown Gordon, who was a leader of the Georgia Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War and may have taken on a broader role in the terrorist organization when its first national leader, a former Confederate general, Nathan Bedford Forrest, suffered declining health.\n\nIn response to the editorial, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman tweeted, \"On a solemn day for remembering those that have given their lives for our country fighting against tyranny and subjugation, the NYT has more than a million possible stories of the ultimate sacrifice by American patriots that they could tell. But they don't.\"\n\nThe editorial board also referenced comments made by an Army spokesman in 2015, who stated there was no need to remove Confederate base names because the \"historic names represent individuals, not causes or ideologies.\" The editorial board countered this argument, stating that these men were traitors and that the names represent not only oppression before and during the Civil War, but also state-sponsored bigotry after it.\n\nThe editorial concluded by stating, \"Bases named for men who sought to destroy the Union in the name of racial injustice are an insult to the ideals servicemen and women are sworn to uphold\u2014and an embarrassing artifact of the time when the military itself embraced anti-American values. It is long past time for those bases to be renamed.\"\n\nThe editorial has sparked a heated debate, with some agreeing with the need for change and others arguing that the names represent history and should not be erased. The issue remains a contentious one, as Americans continue to grapple with the legacy of slavery and racial injustice in the United States.",
    " Title: Mike Bloomberg Takes Center Stage on Super Tuesday, Promising to 'Get It Done'\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, has embarked on a whirlwind tour of Super Tuesday states, aiming to capitalize on the unsettled Democratic presidential race. With Joe Biden's performance in the early contests faltering, polls indicate that Bloomberg is gaining traction.\n\nBernie Sanders won in New Hampshire, with Pete Buttigieg in second, while the two essentially tied in Iowa. However, Bloomberg is bypassing the early states and banking on Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote on March 3, to prove his campaign's viability.\n\nBloomberg's campaign strategy is encapsulated in the slogan that features prominently in his ads, posters, T-shirts, and other campaign materials: \"Mike will get it done.\" The 78-year-old businessman has been crisscrossing the country, making stops in Houston, North Carolina, Tennessee, and other cities, without attacking his Democratic opponents directly.\n\nInstead, Bloomberg's main focus is on defeating Donald Trump, whom he portrays as a threat to the country. He pledges to restore honor to the government, build a country that Americans can be proud of, and bring people together.\n\nIn response to Trump's recent insults, Bloomberg used his rallies to hit back, saying, \"He calls me Little Mike, and the answer is, 'Donald, where I come from, we measure from your neck up.'\"\n\nWhile some voters are still undecided, others, like retiree Michael Day, are drawn to Bloomberg's wealth and resources, which they believe are necessary to defeat Trump. Day, who was at a Winston-Salem event, held up a sign that read, \"The only way to stop a dishonest (crooked, lying, cheating) New York businessman is with an honest New York businessman.\"\n\nHowever, Bloomberg's past has come under scrutiny this week, with stories emerging about his comments on the so-called stop-and-frisk policy and redlining. The Bloomberg campaign has responded to these criticisms with endorsements from African American mayors and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nAs Bloomberg is not on the ballot in the next states to vote, Nevada and South Carolina, his strength with voters can only be measured so far by his polling numbers. He continues to flood the airwaves with ads that highlight his stance on climate change, gun violence, and his record as mayor.\n\nVoters will get their first assessment of Bloomberg on Super Tuesday, when they cast their votes and determine how formidable a candidate he will be.",
    " Title: The Challenges in Convicting Police Officers Involved in Fatal Shootings: A Look at the Ferguson Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the police shooting of Michael Brown, questions remain about the circumstances surrounding the incident and the likelihood of Officer Darren Wilson being convicted of wrongful death. William Yeomans, a former attorney and senior official in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, has highlighted the challenges in convicting police officers involved in fatal shootings.\n\nAs Michael Brown is laid to rest, the nation grapples with the police shooting that took the life of the unarmed African-American teenager two weeks ago. Was Brown unjustifiably gunned down by white police Officer Darren Wilson, as some contend? Or did Wilson, who reportedly sustained some kind of facial injury during an altercation with Brown, act appropriately in the heat of a confrontation in which Brown reportedly reached for the officer's gun?\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. traveled to Ferguson to coordinate a Justice Department investigation into the shooting, which was already being probed by local and state law enforcement agencies. Holder's presence instilled confidence in many that justice will be done. However, for some\u2014especially long-aggrieved minority communities with a history of uneasy and often violent relationships with police\u2014that will only be achieved with Wilson's conviction. But there are long odds against that.\n\nThe history of criminal investigations of police shootings demonstrates how unlikely it is for an officer to be convicted of a crime for using deadly force. While hard numbers are difficult to come by, we know that police shoot hundreds of people each year, and there are at most a handful of successful criminal charges. For better or worse, a variety of legal and cultural elements make criminal accountability uncommon for police officers who kill.\n\n1. We trust and depend on police officers to protect us. It is important to remember that we empower police officers to carry and use weapons to ensure our safety. We expect them to step in to defend us, often in an instant under confusing conditions. As a consequence, we recognize that they must be given some leeway to perform their dangerous jobs. The power with which we cloak police officers creates the potential for abuse and requires that we impose and enforce limits on their use of force, but cautions against punishing them too quickly for mistakes. This fundamental recognition of the role of police officers underlies many of the factors that make convictions rare. It shapes legal standards and influences the willingness of juries to find officers criminally culpable and send them to jail.\n\n2. The backgrounds of the participants affect the process. Use of force by police officers is likely to occur in confrontations with individuals who are suspected\u2014fairly or not\u2014of criminal wrongdoing. Officers are entitled to use reasonably necessary force in such situations, and the question becomes whether they have exceeded that limit. This dynamic can color the investigation, grand jury process, and trial. At each stage, the tendency is to give the benefit of the doubt to the police officer.\n\nThe public release of the video purportedly showing Michael Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store was a transparent effort to reinforce this dynamic. In addition, the principal witness on the scene, other than Officer Wilson, was Michael Brown's companion, who stated immediately after the shooting that Brown was fleeing and was shot in the back\u2014a scenario apparently discredited by the autopsies. The conflicting statements coming out of Ferguson demonstrate the difficulty of relying on eyewitness testimony in these instances. Police shootings often occur in sudden, chaotic circumstances and traumatize witnesses, all of which makes detailed, accurate recollection of events difficult. In contests of credibility between police officers and friends or associates of the victim, investigators and juries often favor the police. Successful prosecutions often turn on a rare combination of extensive forensic evidence and the cooperation, however reluctant, of officers.\n\nVideo of the incident can be crucial. For example, in the prosecution of officers who beat Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991, the federal conviction depended heavily on the ability to parse the individual blows shown in the video taken by a bystander to determine whether officers had exceeded the amount of force necessary to subdue King. Events in Ferguson have generated renewed calls for requiring officers to video confrontations\u2014both as a means of protecting officers from false allegations that they used excessive force and to preserve the record in those instances that raise legitimate concerns.",
    " Title: US Senate Adopts Ground Rules for Trump's Impeachment Trial, Proceedings to Resume Wednesday\n\nThe United States Senate has established the ground rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, following a contentious 13-hour debate on the first day of proceedings. The trial will recommence on Wednesday with arguments from the prosecution, followed by the defense and questions from the senators.\n\nThe trial will unfold over several days, with each side being granted up to 24 hours to present their case. Opening arguments will begin on Wednesday afternoon. After this phase, senators will have an opportunity to ask questions, followed by a period of deliberation on the issue of new witnesses and evidence.\n\nPresident Trump is on trial for abuse of power and obstruction of the congressional impeachment inquiry. He has been impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives and is the third US president to face an impeachment trial. The Senate, controlled by the president's fellow Republicans, is not expected to convict and remove him from office.\n\nThe president is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he has dismissed the accusations against him as a \"total hoax.\" On the question of new witnesses, he has said he will leave the decision to the senators, but the White House has actively worked to block the appearance of certain officials.\n\nDemocrats have expressed a desire to hear testimony from former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The Trump administration has claimed that evidence from Mr. Bolton would pose a national security threat, a claim dismissed by Democrats as a smokescreen.\n\nSenators have taken oaths to act as impartial jurors in a trial presided over by US Chief Justice John Roberts. House Democrats known as \"impeachment managers\" act as the prosecution, while the president's legal team acts as the defense.\n\nUnder the rules approved by the Republican majority, senators are barred from live tweeting and from speaking to those sitting near them while the case is being heard. No outside reading materials are allowed to be brought in.\n\nThe trial will delve into two main allegations against President Trump. The first allegation is that he sought help from Ukraine's government to aid his re-election efforts by withholding military aid in exchange for an anti-corruption investigation into Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden. The second allegation is that he obstructed Congress by refusing to allow White House staff to testify at the impeachment hearings last year.\n\nThe Senate has already rejected a series of Democratic bids to obtain documents and evidence in the impeachment trial. Senators have blocked motions to subpoena White House files related to President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, as well as records and documents from the State Department and White House Budget Office.\n\nIn his opening statement, Adam Schiff, the House Democrat leading the impeachment case, stated that most Americans \"do not believe there will be a fair trial\" and that they believe the Senate will be \"impartial.\" The president's legal team had earlier demanded he be immediately acquitted, calling the trial \"a dangerous perversion of the constitution.\"\n\nThe trial is expected to be marked by further procedural tangles, with key questions surrounding the testimony of White House aides and the potential for new evidence to be presented.",
    " Title: Internal Strife and Evangelical Challenge: Trump Campaign Faces Uncertain Future\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump campaign is currently grappling with internal discord, according to Dr. Gerson Moreno-Riano of Regent University. The coming days will reveal whether the candidate can unite not only his inner circle, but also the Republican Party.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Moreno-Riano discussed the challenges Trump faces with Evangelicals. He stated, \"I think what's happened with the Trump campaign is, I think it's fractured itself internally.\" He further explained, \"I think that it is trying to meet a number of different objectives and keep a number of constituencies very, very happy and it has been unable to do so.\"\n\nDr. Moreno-Riano also pointed out that this internal strife is indicative of a broader problem within the American electorate, particularly among GOP evangelicals. He added, \"The dilemma has always been whether Trump himself has what I'll call the internal character-based resources to pull this off.\"\n\nThe decision to dismiss campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday was made amid reports of disagreements and staff infighting. The move comes just a day before Trump is set to meet with hundreds of evangelical leaders in New York City to address their concerns about his conservative and Christian bona fides.\n\nDr. Moreno-Riano identified abortion, religious liberty, and the Supreme Court as some of the most important issues Trump should address in the meeting. He stated, \"They need to 'bring unity to the table,' and I just don't see that.\"\n\nSince the 1950s, evangelicals have struggled to rally around a single candidate, and Dr. Moreno-Riano believes this is too great a burden to place on Trump. He stated, \"I think they're going to try to assess whether he's truly evangelical or not, so it's a big challenge for him to try and unite them around a common denominator. That's going to be difficult.\"",
    " Title: Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Declines Possible U.S. Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval announced Thursday morning that he is declining a possible nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"Earlier today, I notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States,\" Sandoval said in a statement Thursday. \"I have also spoken to Senators Reid, Heller, and McConnell and expressed the same desire to them.\"\n\nThe White House declined to say Thursday whether Sandoval was ever seriously considered in the first place.\n\n\"Even after the fact, I\u2019m not going to get into a lot of details about who's on the president's list and who is not,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nNevada's senior U.S. senator, Harry Reid, recommended Sandoval for President Barack Obama's consideration in filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. News of Sandoval's vetting leaked to the public on Wednesday as the White House considered Sandoval, among other unidentified candidates, for the nomination.\n\nSandoval's ultimate nomination was seen by many as unlikely, with his name suggested to pressure Republicans into considering a nominee from their own party. Sandoval, formerly a federal district court judge, is a moderate Republican.\n\nSince the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this month, Republican leaders in the Senate have vowed to block any of the president's proposed replacements.\n\n\"I really do think it was a serious idea for him to be considered,\" said Richardson, professor of sociology and judicial studies at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"I don\u2019t think he was being used as a pawn.\"\n\nHowever, Richardson sees why Sandoval would remove himself once his name leaked. Sandoval has been thrown into a political brawl between Republicans and Democrats, he said.\n\n\"I can understand why the governor wouldn\u2019t want to get caught up in that,\" Richardson said. \"I think, in the future, his name will be brought up again. He\u2019s a moderate Republican. They\u2019re thin on the ground these days.\"\n\nSandoval is not a textbook Republican. He does not actively oppose gay marriage or abortion, and he recently pushed through the largest tax increase in Nevada history.\n\nNevada's Republican Sen. Dean Heller said he supports Sandoval's decision to withdraw from Supreme Court consideration, but he views Sandoval as a legitimate candidate.\n\n\"I hope the next president will consider him in the future,\" Heller said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nEven if Sandoval was a serious contender for the Supreme Court, history suggests his chances are slim. Twenty-one justices have been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court since 1956, and they share similar backgrounds, according to The Supreme Court Historical Society.\n\nTwo-thirds of Supreme Court justices attended either Harvard or Yale law schools. A couple earned their law degrees at Northwestern or Stanford universities. Columbia University, Howard University, and the St. Paul College of Law made isolated appearances.\n\nOf the eight members currently serving on the Supreme Court, four earned their law degrees at Harvard, three went to Yale, and one attended Columbia. Sandoval earned his degree at Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1989.",
    " Title: South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham Embraces Immigration Reform, Faces No Immediate Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that may seem counterintuitive, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a red-state Republican seen as vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, has embraced a plan to allow illegal immigrants to gain U.S. citizenship, a contentious issue among GOP primary voters. Despite this, there appears to be no immediate backlash in his home state, South Carolina.\n\nThis move reflects both Graham's political strength and the rapid evolution of the Republican Party's stance on immigration since the party's November setback among Latinos. Long viewed with suspicion by the right wing, Graham, who endorsed the Kennedy-McCain immigration reform bill in 2007, now feels secure enough heading into 2014 to take a politically risky stance on a deeply debated issue he is passionate about.\n\nImmediately after the November election, Graham reached out to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to discuss a bipartisan deal on immigration, a move few Republicans have been willing to make in recent years. In 2007, Graham faced boos at town halls for supporting reform, and his proposal was labeled \"Grahamnesty\" by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.\n\n\"There are going to be people who are upset,\" Graham told a media outlet last week. \"I do believe that people in the Republican Party are beginning to understand the politics of immigration. But people do want the borders secured; they want to get this issue behind us; and I think I'm in a good spot to go back home and tell people that now is the time to get this done.\"\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, a fellow member of the Gang of Eight, provides Graham some cover on his right flank. The 2012 electoral defeat, partly due to Mitt Romney's 27% showing with Hispanics, has prompted many Republicans to reconsider their opposition to a comprehensive immigration overhaul.\n\nRandy Page, chairman of the GOP committee in South Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, is one such Republican. He voted last summer to include tough language in the GOP national platform as South Carolina's representative on the committee that drafted its contents.\n\n\"A number of us, myself included, have looked at the message that the Republican Party has been sending and looking at the message that the Hispanic community sent us in November, and we've started to listen to what Sen. Rubio and Sen. Graham have been saying,\" Page said.\n\n\"Looking specifically at Hispanics, most of them support us on other issues\u2014whether social issues or fiscal issues,\" he added. \"They're saying, 'We agree with you on life and school choice and so many other things,' but yet we're saying, 'You're not welcome. And we want you to go back and self-deport yourself'? That's the wrong rhetoric, and it's, frankly, the wrong solution.\"\n\nThe developments in South Carolina mirror changes in conservative thought leaders nationally. Television host Sean Hannity, columnist Charles Krauthammer, and others have announced changes in their stance on immigration reform since the election.",
    " Title: Annapolis Capital Gazette Shooting: Five Killed, Two Injured in Targeted Attack on Local Newspaper\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a gunman stormed into the offices of the Annapolis Capital Gazette on Thursday, opening fire on the newsroom, killing five people and injuring two others, police said. The attack, which police are calling a \"targeted attack,\" left the community in mourning and the nation questioning the safety of journalists.\n\nThe gunman, identified by the Baltimore Sun and other news outlets as Jarrod W. Ramos, a 38-year-old Laurel resident, reportedly held a grudge against the paper, having unsuccessfully filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper in 2012 over coverage of a criminal harassment case against him.\n\nThe victims of the shooting were Wendi Winters, special publications editor; Rob Hiaasen, editor and Sunday columnist; John McNamara, writer; Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor; and Rebecca Smith, sales assistant. According to Selene San Felice, a reporter with the Capital Gazette who spoke to CNN on Thursday evening, the gunman targeted the newspaper's editors.\n\nAuthorities responded quickly to the shooting, taking the suspect into custody without exchanging fire. They cleared the building, evacuating about 170 people, and found smoke grenades in the process. Two others were injured, possibly by glass shattering from gunshot blasts, but their injuries were not caused by gunfire.\n\nThe Capital Gazette, a 30,000-circulation daily, has offices in a building on the outskirts of downtown Annapolis. The building houses other professional offices, and people in those offices described a harrowing ordeal.\n\nDefiant survivors of the attack vowed to continue their work. \"I can tell you this: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow,\" reporter Chase Cook tweeted. The newspaper's staff took to Twitter to share details of the assault, describing the gunman as shooting through the glass doors to the office, then opening fire on employees.\n\nThe shooting prompted wild speculation from some who blamed President Trump for creating an environment that fueled the shooting. However, the police have not released any information linking the shooting to the president or his criticism of the press.\n\nThe Capital Gazette shooting has left the community in shock and mourning, with many questioning how such a tragedy could occur in a town known for its safety. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and the nation waits for answers.",
    " Title: Stormy Daniels Expands Lawsuit Against President Trump, Adds Michael Cohen as Defendant\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Adult film actress Stormy Daniels on Monday escalated her legal battle with President Donald Trump, arguing in court that Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen defamed her by suggesting she lied about an alleged affair with Trump.\n\nIn a new filing, Daniels amended her existing lawsuit against Trump, adding Cohen as a defendant, a day after her widely viewed 60 Minutes interview in which she provided salacious details about the alleged sexual encounter and claimed she had been physically threatened to keep quiet about Trump.\n\nCohen and his lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to broadening the lawsuit to include Cohen, the new filing argues that a $130,000 payment for her silence days before the 2016 election amounted to an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nDaniels' defamation claim centers on a statement Cohen made in February, explaining why he arranged the payment to Daniels. He said he used his own money to \"facilitate\" the payoff and said Trump was not aware of his actions at the time.\n\n\"Just because something is not true does not mean that it can't cause you harm or damage,\" Cohen said in the statement, adding that he would \"always protect Trump.\"\n\nIn her new filings, Daniels said that statement implied she was lying about the affair and exposed her to \"hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame.\"\n\nThe White House on Monday denied breaking any campaign-finance laws in the payment to Daniels and also sought to cast doubts about her claim that she was physically threatened to keep quiet about the alleged tryst.\n\n\"The president does not believe that any of the claims Ms. Daniels made in the interview last night were accurate,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters when asked about Daniels' 60 Minutes appearance. \"There's nothing to corroborate her claim.\"\n\nDaniels' updated lawsuit and Shah's remarks from the White House briefing room mark the latest twist in a legal saga that seems ripped from the pages of a New York tabloid. The adult film actress and her attorney Michael Avenatti are waging an aggressive public-relations campaign to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with Trump's lawyer.\n\nCohen, known as a fierce defender of Trump from his days as a top Trump Organization attorney, also is punching back hard. Cohen's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to Avenatti after the interview aired Sunday night, demanding that Daniels retract \"false and defamatory\" claims she made to 60 Minutes.\n\nIn the CBS interview, Daniels said she agreed to keep silent about the alleged 2006 sexual relationship with Trump in exchange for a $130,000 payment arranged by Cohen because she feared for her safety.\n\nThose fears, she said, were rooted in a 2011 encounter with an unidentified man who threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot after she first tried to sell her story to a tabloid magazine and told her to \"Leave Trump alone.\"\n\nOn Monday, Shah declined to say whether Trump watched the interview. He also said the \"White House did not engage in any wrongdoing\" in connection with election laws.\n\nTrump himself, who routinely torches his political rivals on Twitter, has been uncharacteristically silent about Daniels \u2014 even after she spilled unflattering details about their alleged encounter on national television. (On 60 Minutes, Daniels said she was not attracted to Trump and described playfully spanking him with a magazine that featured him on the cover.)\n\nTrump's team has denied the affair, a contention repeated by Shah on Monday. \"The president strongly, clearly, and has consistently denied these underlying claims, and the only person who's been inconsistent is the one making the claims,\" he said.\n\nWatchdog groups also have filed complaints arguing that the $130,000 payment to Daniels, made 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, likely violated campaign-finance laws that limit the size and source of donations to federal candidates.\n\nAsked why Daniels was paid to stay quiet before the election if the affair did not happen, Shah said: \"False charges are settled out of court all the time, and this is nothing outside the ordinary.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Accelerates Initiative to Decouple U.S. Supply Chain from China, Weighs New Tariffs and Sanctions\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly accelerating an initiative to reduce the United States' reliance on China for its supply chain, in response to the economic fallout and human toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. This move is an extension of President Trump's long-standing pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\n\nKeith Krach, the undersecretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment at the State Department, told Reuters that the administration is \"turbocharging\" the initiative to shift the supply chain from China. Krach emphasized the importance of identifying critical areas and bottlenecks in the supply chain, and suggested that new government action could be announced soon.\n\nMultiple government agencies, including the Commerce and State departments, are reportedly examining ways to move the supply chain and manufacturing from China using tax incentives and other measures. They are also evaluating which manufacturing work should be considered \"essential\" and how to produce those goods outside of China.\n\nA senior U.S. official told Reuters that there is a whole-of-government push to address this issue, with the White House's policy on China having been caught between pro-trade advisers and China hawks. However, the current situation has given the hard-liners new ammunition, as the pandemic has crystallized concerns about doing business with China.\n\nThe president has discussed imposing new tariffs on top of the 25 percent levies on $370 billion in Chinese goods that are already in place. The administration is also considering imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or companies and developing closer relations with Taiwan, which China considers a rogue province.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said late last month that the administration is working with several countries, including Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam, to \"move the global economy forward.\" He also mentioned that the talks include how to restructure supply chains to prevent a similar crisis in the future.\n\nThe pandemic has highlighted China's critical role in the supply chain for generic drugs in the U.S., as well as medical equipment and food supplies. However, many U.S. companies have heavily invested in China and rely on the country's 1.4 billion people for sales.\n\nDoug Barry, spokesman for the U.S.-China Business Council, told Reuters that diversification and redundancy in supply chains will make sense given the level of risk the pandemic has uncovered. However, he cautioned against a wholesale exit from China by companies doing business there.\n\nJohn Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that building new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. could take up to eight years. He expressed concern that officials need to gather the right factual information before they start looking at alternatives.",
    " Title: Media Fact-Checkers Dispute Romney's \"Apology Tour\" Claim Against Obama, but Factual Evidence Suggests Otherwise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the third presidential debate, political commentator Charles Krauthammer, on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel, praised Mitt Romney's assertion that President Barack Obama embarked on an \"apology tour\" during his first term. However, mainstream media outlets have disputed this characterization, citing the lack of the word \"apologize\" in Obama's speeches.\n\nDuring the debate, Obama contested Romney's claim, stating that fact-checkers and reporters have found no evidence to support the \"apology tour\" allegation. Krauthammer, a contributor to Special Report with Bret Baier, dismissed this defense as \"about as weak an answer you can get.\"\n\nABC and CNN were among the media outlets that defended Obama. ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos questioned if there were any \"glaring misstatements by either candidate,\" and Jon Karl focused on Romney's claim of the \"apology tour.\" Karl argued that after reviewing Obama's speeches during his first foreign trips, the President did not apologize for America.\n\nCNN outright labeled the characterization as \"False,\" stating that Obama did not use the word \"apology\" or say he was sorry in any of his speeches. CNN anchor John Berman, however, seemed to misunderstand the concept of a metaphor, as he refused to acknowledge Obama's critical comments about past U.S. foreign policy as an apology.\n\nThe Media Research Center's Brent Baker, the Steven P.J. Wood Senior Fellow and Vice President for Research and Publications, pointed out that there is a wealth of examples of Obama criticizing past U.S. foreign policy. The Heritage Foundation, five months into Obama's term, was able to compile a \"Top 10 Apologies\" list, which included Obama's speech in France, where he stated, \"At times we sought to dictate our terms.\"\n\nOther instances cited by the Heritage Foundation, such as Obama's address to the Turkish parliament, his speech at the National Archives, and his comments about Guantanamo, suggest that Obama's speeches, while not explicitly using the word \"apology,\" conveyed a sense of regret and criticism of past U.S. foreign policy.\n\nWith the election approaching, Obama may have an advantage in knowing that the press corps will work to debunk potent attacks on topics where Obama is vulnerable among swing state voters.",
    " Title: Maine Ebola Nurse Kaci Hickox Challenges Mandatory Quarantine, Legal Experts Question Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a standoff between civil rights and public health, Ebola nurse Kaci Hickox has expressed her opposition to a potential mandatory quarantine, stating that her civil rights are being violated. Hickox, who was treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone for Doctors Without Borders, returned to the United States on Friday and is currently residing in Fort Kent, Maine.\n\nDuring a press conference tonight, Maine Health Commissioner Mary Mayhew announced that the state would seek a court order to enforce a 21-day quarantine for Hickox, although the order would first need to be approved by a judge before it could be enforced. However, legal experts question whether such an order would be approved, as the state would need to prove that Hickox is infected or has been credibly exposed to the virus, and that her behavior poses a risk to others.\n\nHickox, 33, was questioned and quarantined in an outdoor tent at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey despite having no symptoms. She registered a fever on an infrared thermometer at the airport but an oral thermometer at University Hospital in Newark showed that she actually had no fever. After twice testing negative for the deadly virus, Hickox was released and returned home to Maine on Monday.\n\nIn a statement, Maine's governor and other officials said they were seeking legal authority to enforce what started out as a voluntary quarantine. They also stated that state police were monitoring Hickox's home \"for both her protection and the health of the community.\"\n\n\"We are very concerned about her safety and health and that of the community,\" Maine Gov. Paul LePage said. \"We are exploring all of our options for protecting the health and well-being of the healthcare worker, anyone who comes in contact with her, the Fort Kent community and all of Maine.\"\n\nHickox told \"Good Morning America\" today via Skype from her hometown of Fort Kent that she will go to court to attain her freedom. \"I have been completely asymptomatic since I've been here. I feel absolutely great,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not consider health workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa to be at \"high risk\" for catching Ebola if they were wearing protective gear. The CDC recommends that these workers undergo monitoring, avoid public transportation, and take other precautions, but does not require home quarantines for these workers. Someone is not contagious until Ebola symptoms appear, and transmission requires contact with bodily fluids such as blood and vomit.\n\nAs this story unfolds, real-time updates will be provided.

    " Title: North Korea-South Korea Tensions Escalate: Military Hotlines Severed, Propaganda War Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of tensions, North Korea has severed its last military hotlines with South Korea and increased its rhetoric, causing concern in the region. Thousands of North Koreans rallied in central Pyongyang, chanting \"Death to the U.S. imperialists.\" Their leader, Kim Jong Un, has been calling for \"scores to be settled\" with the U.S.\n\nThis latest phase marks a continuation of a propaganda war. Pyongyang also released a video depicting an invasion of Seoul, with North Korean forces flying across the border to destroy American bases in South Korea. The regime also cancelled the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War. However, experts are skeptical about North Korea's threats to attack American bases in Guam, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.\n\nKim Heung-kyu, a professor at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul and an adviser to South Korea's last president, Lee Myung-bak, stated, \"I do not think they are capable of launching this type of attack against the United States.\" He anticipates North Korea's provocations to be of a different nature, targeting military areas or certain scientific facilities, causing significant disruption.\n\nSouth Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, has continued to advocate for \"trustpolitik,\" aiming to re-establish trust while maintaining a tough stance with the North. Pyongyang is believed to be trying to pressure her to soften her policies and seek direct talks with Washington.\n\nWith communication links severed, the biggest danger is miscalculation, according to John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul. \"Both countries are essentially on a kind of war footing. In the South, there's an expectation that some provocation could be coming soon, and there's no one on the end of the [hotline] to answer, to clarify,\" he says. \"South Koreans are finger-on-the-trigger ready to do something. That's why it's so dangerous to have no channel whatsoever between the two countries right now.\"\n\nNorth Korea's antagonism towards its traditional ally, China, has also increased, following the rocket launch and third nuclear test. Peking University's Jia Qingguo states that China's position is much tougher than before, and China is on board for stiffer U.N. sanctions against its old ally.\n\nHowever, Beijing's primary concern remains stability, making it unlikely to abandon Pyongyang at this time. The propaganda war continues, with the escalating threats and massive rallies leaving Pyongyang with little room to maneuver. One thing is clear: The new young leader, Kim Jong Un, has learned from his father's playbook and may yet prove to be more unpredictable.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus Results: Cruz Tops GOP Race, Clinton and Sanders in Deadlock Among Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Republican Senator Ted Cruz emerged victorious in the Iowa caucus on Monday, beating billionaire Donald Trump by a margin of 4 percentage points. Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, followed closely in third place, positioning himself as the leading establishment candidate. Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders remained in a near-tie, with both candidates garnering approximately 50% of the vote with 95% of precincts reporting.\n\nCruz, a conservative lawmaker from Texas, secured 28% of the vote, while Trump, a businessman, received 24%. Rubio, who has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, earned 23% of the vote. Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who struggled to gain traction in the Democratic race, suspended his campaign after taking third place with less than 1% of the vote.\n\nThe tight race between Clinton and Sanders has been a closely watched contest, with both candidates vying for the support of the Democratic electorate. Clinton, who lost to then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008, said she was breathing a \"big sigh of relief\" after the results. Sanders, who has been leading in opinion polls in New Hampshire, declared the results a \"virtual tie.\"\n\nThe results of the Iowa caucus could shift momentum in both races. Clinton is hoping for a strong finish against Sanders to vanquish his insurgent candidacy, while Sanders is looking to build on his momentum in the upcoming New Hampshire primary. Rubio's third-place finish has established him as the Republican mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz.\n\nIn his victory speech, Cruz thanked God and expressed gratitude to the voters of Iowa. \"Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation,\" he said. Trump, who congratulated Cruz and expressed optimism for the upcoming New Hampshire primary, said, \"I'm just honored, I'm really honored.\"\n\nClinton and Sanders both acknowledged the tight race and expressed gratitude to their supporters. \"It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now to have a real contest of ideas,\" Clinton said. Sanders, who ran an underdog campaign, said, \"Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state, we had no political organization, we had no money, we had no name recognition, and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America.\"\n\nThe 2016 election is shaping up to be a contentious race, with disgruntled Americans expressing concerns over issues such as immigration, terrorism, income inequality, and healthcare. The results of the Iowa caucus could have implications for the remaining primaries and the general election in November.\n\nMarket reaction to the results was muted, with U.S. stock futures down around half a percent. Some analysts suggested that financial markets might be more comfortable with Clinton than Sanders, but it is too early to expect the U.S. presidential race to have a significant impact on the U.S. stock market.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee also announced the suspension of his campaign for the Republican party nomination. Iowa has held the first nominating contests since the early 1970s, giving it extra weight in the U.S. electoral process that can translate into momentum for winning candidates. The caucuses are voter gatherings that take place in 1,100 schools, churches, and other public locations across the Midwestern state.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Strategic Petroleum Reserve: A Potential $860 Million Windfall for Oil Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unconventional move, the federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) could have potentially generated a significant profit for taxpayers by taking advantage of the current and future price gap of U.S. crude oil. However, due to the lack of authorization and the recent oil storage agreement with oil companies, the SPR is likely to provide a substantial profit to the oil industry instead.\n\nCurrent oil prices have plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of oil in the market, leaving little storage capacity available. As of April 10, the SPR had 78.5 million barrels of spare capacity, a significant amount that could have been used to purchase oil at Friday's price of $18.27 and sell it in December for $33.82, resulting in a profit of $1.22 billion. Given the current oil price drop, the potential profit would be approximately $860 million.\n\nHowever, the federal government was unable to take advantage of this opportunity due to a lack of authorization and funding. Arbitraging oil by simultaneously buying and selling it is not a common practice for the federal government, and the Energy Department's request for funds to buy oil for the SPR was not included in the recent stimulus legislation.\n\nThe Trump administration has, however, ordered the SPR to store 23 million barrels of oil for hard-pressed oil companies, reducing the SPR's spare capacity to 55.5 million barrels. Assuming the same $15.55 per barrel spread, the potential profit is now $863 million. The Energy Department declined to disclose the storage fee or the duration of the oil storage agreement.\n\nThe oil companies depositing oil in the SPR and then receiving most of it back will likely turn a profit that could have otherwise gone to taxpayers. June oil futures were selling for 34% more than the then-current price, July futures were 57% higher, and the numbers kept climbing. This spread is likely to be more than the rent rate that the SPR will charge.\n\nWhile some may oppose anything that increases oil production, the potential profit from the SPR is likely to go to oil companies if the issue is not addressed quickly by the Trump administration or Congress. The SPR was established at taxpayer expense, and it would be more beneficial for taxpayers to profit from the reserve rather than oil companies.\n\nWhile $860 million may seem like a small amount compared to the looming budget deficits, it is a significant sum that could have been generated for taxpayers if the SPR had been authorized to simultaneously buy and sell oil to earn a profit. The Trump administration has the authority to order the SPR to store oil for producers, and it is likely that the SPR's spare capacity will be committed to this purpose. Therefore, it is crucial for the government to address this issue and ensure that the SPR benefits taxpayers rather than oil companies.",
    " Title: Intense Clashes Reported at Iraq-Syria Border as Kurdish Forces Battle Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nHeavy fighting has been reported at a key border crossing between Iraq and Syria, where Kurdish forces are engaged in a battle against Islamic State (IS) militants. Iraqi Kurdish troops have reportedly recaptured the town of Rabia, but have suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, IS fighters are attempting to dislodge Syrian Kurdish forces on the other side of the border.\n\nThe recapture of Rabia by Iraqi Kurdish troops, according to reports, was aided by air strikes by a US-led coalition on IS targets in both Syria and Iraq. Two British Tornado jets are said to have contributed to the retaking of an \"important border crossing\" at Rabia, as per BBC's Clive Myrie in Irbil, northern Iraq.\n\nIn Syria, US warplanes conducted 11 air strikes over the last two days, targeting IS positions near Deir al-Zour, Sinjar, Mazra al-Duwud, and Aleppo. These strikes destroyed a number of armed vehicles, artillery pieces, and one tank.\n\nIn Iraq, 11 US raids on Tuesday in the north-west, and near the Mosul Dam and Baghdad, destroyed IS armoured and transport vehicles and a checkpoint.\n\nViolence has also claimed lives in Iraq, with at least 20 people killed in bomb attacks on Shia areas of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, and similar attacks in the holy Shia city of Karbala.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, stated that 11 million people inside Syria require urgent aid. She warned that without additional funding, the World Food Programme will be forced to end its operations completely within two months.\n\nIn a separate development, Turkish tanks have taken up positions along the border near the Syrian town of Kobane after several shells hit Turkish territory during clashes between IS and Kurdish fighters. The Turkish government has asked parliament to authorize military action against IS in Iraq and Syria, and MPs are expected to discuss the issue on Thursday.\n\nSenior Iraqi Kurdish officials reported that their Peshmerga special forces made significant progress during their dawn offensive in Rabia. By nightfall, Rabia was said to be firmly in Kurdish hands, although IS militants continued to hold out in just one building.\n\nRabia is located about 100km (60 miles) north-west of Mosul, the biggest city controlled by IS. However, the Iraqi Kurdish forces also took heavy casualties, including the loss of a senior commander, when three suicide car bombers detonated themselves among the Kurdish troops. The bombers are believed to have travelled from IS-controlled areas further east.\n\nControl of the Rabia crossing and cutting IS supply lines are seen as important steps towards an eventual move to regain the town of Sinjar and its nearby mountain. Militants overran that area in August, forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the minority Yazidi community to flee for their lives.\n\nThe other side of the border is controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters, who themselves have been coming under attacks from IS. More than 30 Syrian Kurdish fighters are reported to have been killed as the jihadists took over several villages south of the border crossing. However, the crossing itself is said to be still under Kurdish control.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Aims to Foster Party Unity Ahead of Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is set to meet privately with his supporters on Monday, aiming to encourage unity amidst lingering discontent over the primary process. Sanders' backers have expressed frustration over the nominating procedures, the party platform, and party leadership, with some suggesting they may protest or take action on the convention floor.\n\nHowever, Sanders has maintained a positive message in recent interviews, expressing his support for Hillary Clinton. \"I'm proud that, in the Democratic platform that was passed a few weeks ago, we are making some real progress,\" Sanders said on CNN Sunday. He added, \"My focus right now is defeating (Donald) Trump, electing Clinton, electing progressive candidates around this country, and focusing on the issues that matter the most to working families.\"\n\nThe publication of thousands of hacked emails last week, some of which suggested the DNC was favoring Clinton during the primary season, has further fueled Sanders supporters' concerns about party officials' bias towards Clinton. While party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down soon, she will still have a convention role, which could draw jeers from Sanders delegates.\n\nAt a meeting of the DNC credentials committee on Sunday, comments praising Wasserman Schultz were met with laughter by some Sanders supporters. At a committee meeting the previous day, Sanders backers shouted \"shame, shame, shame\" as amendments to abolish or limit superdelegates in future nominating competitions were voted down.\n\nSome Sanders delegates feel the Clinton campaign is not taking their policy concerns seriously. At a news conference on Sunday, Sanders delegate Norman Solomon, 65, of Point Reyes Station, California, said many of Sanders' liberal supporters were disappointed in Clinton's vice presidential pick of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. He said most viewed Kaine as not progressive enough, and there had been discussion about a variety of protest actions at the convention, including walking out.\n\nHowever, Sanders delegate Courtney Rowe, 34, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said, \"We're not here to disrupt for the purpose of disruption.\" She said she was not currently planning on any action and wanted to hear from Sanders.\n\nSanders, who endorsed Clinton two weeks ago after a long-fought primary, has sought to find common ground around the party platform and rules. He successfully won major platform concessions, including a $15 federal minimum wage, abolishing the death penalty, and breaking up large Wall Street banks. The two sides also agreed on a \"unity commission\" that will review changes to the nominating process, including limiting the role of superdelegates.\n\nAfter the unity commission agreement, Sanders supporters seeking to pass amendments to abolish or curtail superdelegates opted against pursuing convention floor fights on the issue. Sanders has also made clear that he would like to see a full roll call vote at the convention, so that his delegates can show their support.",
    " Title: The Uncertain Future of Healthcare Reform: A Look at the GOP's Dilemma\n\nArticle:\n\nFor over three years, the Republican party has been embroiled in a contentious debate over the appropriate response to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with some advocating for its repeal and replacement, while others push for its outright repeal and a return to the pre-Obamacare status quo. In practice, their position has been the latter, as they have repeatedly voted to repeal the law without presenting a unified replacement plan.\n\nThe failure to agree on a replacement plan has at times been a liability for the Republicans, damaging their credibility as critics of healthcare reform with the press and the public alike. The argument goes that the old system was flawed, and if the ACA has been troubled in its implementation, why should the country return to it?\n\nHowever, the current state of the ACA's rollout has not prompted relief among Republicans, as one might expect. Instead, they are reportedly \"incredibly relieved\" because the lack of a \"GOP healthcare plan\" allows them to continue attacking the law without having to address the benefits it has provided to millions of Americans.\n\nThe New Republic's Jonathan Cohn has pointed out that all Republican-supported healthcare reform plans would disrupt the insurance market more dramatically than the ACA does. Nearly all GOP plans would kick millions of people off of Medicaid, and create a huge incentive for healthy workers to abandon their employer-sponsored insurance for individual plans, leading to a death spiral in the insurance market.\n\nThe National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru's solution to this problem is to phase out the ACA slowly, while other smart conservatives propose replacing all insurance with subsidized catastrophic coverage and tax-preferred health savings accounts.\n\nThe Republican party's treatment of President Obama's \"if you like your plan, you can keep it\" promise as the \"noble lie\" from which all of the ACA's apocalyptic consequences will ultimately spring has been criticized. However, the focus-grouped deception they hope to perpetrate against seniors, by eliminating traditional Medicare for future retirees and replacing it with a plan that resembles the ACA, is far more egregious.\n\nThe phase-out of single-payer Medicare would be massively disruptive, as the program's beneficiaries aged and dwindled in number, becoming unsustainable very quickly. Without scale, the government would either have to fork over tons of money to motivate providers to care for beneficiaries or watch providers abandon the program en masse, leaving the country's oldest, sickest people little choice but to enter the private insurance market.\n\nIn conclusion, the Republican party's inability to agree on a replacement plan for the ACA has left them in a precarious position, as they struggle to balance their criticism of the law with the radical intent of their own vision for healthcare reform. The consequences and political fallout of any GOP plan containing elements like these could be far more severe than the great cancellation row of 2013.",
    " Title: Analysis of the 2014 Midterm Elections: House of Representatives Remains Likely to Remain in Republican Control\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2014 midterm elections approach, the House of Representatives is gearing up for a significant shift in power, with national Democrats targeting enough Republican-held seats to potentially regain control. However, the current arithmetic favors the Republicans, who currently hold 233 seats, compared to the Democrats' 200 seats, with two vacancies yet to be filled.\n\nThe Democrats' strategy, often referred to as \"the magic 17,\" focuses on the 17 Republican-held districts that President Barack Obama carried in the 2012 election, while also sending a Republican to the House. A victory in all 17 districts by Democratic candidates would result in a Democratic majority, with 218 seats to the Republicans' 217.\n\nHowever, this strategy hinges on Democrats winning every targeted seat and Republicans picking up none. As House editor David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report notes, \"There's basically no margin of error for House Democrats.\"\n\nOn the other side, Republicans are expected to target the nine districts that voted for Mitt Romney for president but sent a Democrat to the House. These include the two closest races of the 2012 election: North Carolina's 7th District and Arizona's 2nd, where Republicans David Rouzer and Martha McSally will face rematches with Democratic Reps. Mike McIntyre and Ron Barber, respectively.\n\nOne of the most vulnerable Democratic-held districts is Florida's 18th, where 30-year-old Democrat Patrick Murphy narrowly defeated Allen West in 2012. Already, four Republicans have filed to oppose Murphy in 2014. Murphy's support for delays in the Obamacare mandate for businesses and individuals, coupled with his vote against Obamacare repeal, is expected to be a significant issue for any Republican opponent.\n\nThe early favorite to oppose Murphy is Carl Domino, a former assistant state house GOP leader, successful investments adviser, and U.S. Navy veteran.\n\nFor open seats, competition and \"switcheroos\" are more common than attempting to dislodge incumbents. So far, there are 14 seats without incumbents\u2014five Democratic-held seats and nine Republican-held seats. The West Virginia seat being vacated by Republican Shelley Moore Capito, who is running for the Senate, could potentially flip to the Democrats, as could the Iowa seat being vacated by Democrat Bruce Braley, who is also running for the Senate.\n\nHowever, few of the other 12 seats are likely to flip at this time. As former Secretary of State James Baker once said, \"Overnight is an eternity in politics.\" Much can change between now and November 2014. But at this time, the best prediction is the House remains Republican next year. Just do the math.",
    " Title: Progressive Immigration Activists Shift Focus from Critics to White House as Grassroots Pressure Mounts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in the immigration debate, progressive grassroots organizations are increasingly directing their efforts towards influencing the White House, as they perceive it as the most viable avenue for progress given the Republican control of the House and the election-year jitters.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who has few remaining progressive allies not focused on the immigration debate, now faces mounting pressure from grassroots-led organizations that are traditionally instrumental in shaping the immigration debate on the left. These organizations view the White House, and the potential for Obama to act independently, as the primary means to advance on the issue.\n\nThis shift has sparked a rift within the small community of immigration activists, most of whom have worked together for years. The divide, described as a low-grade civil war over immigration messaging, has seen those advocating for the president to take unilateral action on deportations gain the upper hand.\n\nTwo organizations, the Center for American Progress and the National Council of La Raza, are the only groups within the progressive immigration world that are not demanding Obama halt deportations himself. Critics argue that these organizations may be too close to the White House to maintain objectivity.\n\nChris Newman, the legal director of the Los Angeles-based National Day Laborer Organizing Network, expressed concerns about the perceived tension between administrative advocacy and legislative campaigns. \"We all have our different roles to play,\" he said, \"but there is a perception outside of the Washington Beltway that some organizations with access have become apologists for the administration.\"\n\nImmigration activists, who typically collaborate closely, are reluctant to publicly criticize each other. One official from an immigration group that has demanded a stop to deportations said, \"It's access misinterpreted as influence.\" The official added, \"We operate on the fundamental rule that if they're upset, we're making progress. It is how this White House operates. If you're friendly to them, they think they've got you in their pocket. If you're tough with them, they scream and moan and complain, but it gets their attention.\"\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) noted that the push to stop deportations has gained such broad support at the grassroots level that no Washington organization can halt it. \"It's becoming something that you can't control,\" Gutierrez said. \"People have tried to control it. This administration has put inordinate pressure on people not to criticize the president on his immigration policy and not to talk about prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nThe most vocal group demanding action on deportations is the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, whose director, Pablo Alvarado, was arrested with Hispanic religious leaders Monday outside the White House to protest deportation policy. The group, which was once part of the White House's broad immigration coalition, has lost access and contact with the White House after becoming more vocal in its demands for Obama to halt deportations.\n\nThe internal debate is confined to progressive immigration organizations. The more reliant a group is on grassroots support, the more likely it is to pressure the White House to act on deportations. Conversely, the more a group's influence relies on access to power, the less likely it is to push back. Conservative and business-focused groups like Mike Bloomberg's Partnership for a New American Economy, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Fwd.us have kept their focus entirely on moving legislation in Congress and have not sought to pressure Obama on deportations.\n\nKica Matos of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement acknowledged the differences in opinion within the movement but emphasized the shared resolve: \"There are differences of opinion in the movement about how to move forward on reform, but the movement is resolute about one thing: We want reform, and we want it now.\"\n\nDespite the internal divisions, the White House's position on immigration remains unchanged. Officials maintain that Obama does not have the authority to act unilaterally on deportations without Congress. The closest the president has come to suggesting otherwise was during a Google Hangout last month when he said he was willing to \"look at all options.\"\n\nSpeaking on Univision radio on Friday, Obama urged listeners to call Republicans in Congress and demand they address immigration. \"I've been pushing and pushing Congress to take action,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has not passed a bill yet. And for it to become law, we need the House of Representatives to pass that bill. The main thing people can do right now is put pressure on Republicans who have refused so far to act.\"",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Viral Claims Surrounding the History of Aunt Jemima's Founder, Nancy Green\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of posts on social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, have gone viral in response to Quaker Oats' decision to discontinue the Aunt Jemima logo and brand. These posts claim to tell the history of Aunt Jemima, with a focus on the life of Nancy Green, the first model hired to portray the character.\n\nThe posts suggest that Green created a cooking brand that was later purchased by a larger company, which transformed the brand into Aunt Jemima and used her likeness to promote the product. As a result, the posts claim, Green became a millionaire and used her wealth to become an anti-poverty and equal rights activist.\n\nHowever, the actual history of Nancy Green is more complex and less glamorized than these viral posts suggest. While record-keeping of that period, especially for African-Americans, was limited, what is known of Green's life indicates that her relationship with the Aunt Jemima brand was not the equal, beneficial partnership that these posts make it out to be.\n\nThe Aunt Jemima brand was not created by Green but by Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood, who named their new pancake flour after a minstrel show song titled \"Old Aunt Jemima.\" Green was hired after Rutt and Underwood sold the company to R.T. Davis to portray an image that already existed in popular culture: that of a \"mammy,\" a racist stereotype of an amiable, older, overweight African American woman who served in a domestic role to whites. The logo has undergone six changes to move away from the mammy stereotype, meaning the logo currently on Aunt Jemima products does not, as some have suggested, still depict Nancy Green.\n\nPatricia Turner, a professor in UCLA's Department of African American Studies and senior dean of the UCLA College, has cast doubt on the claims made in the viral posts. In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check, Turner said that it's highly unlikely that Green was extraordinarily wealthy: \"I know of no record of what they paid her or what that relationship was like, but we do know that black people were exploited by white businessmen; think of what you know about musicians and actors and actresses and writers who never got their share of the product that they produced.\"\n\nTurner added that it was plausible that Green was paid well enough to live comfortably, but that she certainly was not a \"millionaire philanthropist\" as claimed in the viral social media posts. \"She might have been paid well enough to support her church and to support some activities, that's feasible in my mind,\" said Turner, \"but the stretch between that and what it would have been to have been a millionaire in that era...think of what it would have been, how much money a million dollars would have been in the 1890s and the first couple of decades of the 20th century.\"\n\nGiven what is known of Nancy Green's life and of what records of it exist, social media posts downplaying the racist nature of the Aunt Jemima brand rely on factually incorrect information and fabrications for which there is no record.",
    " Title: The Anonymous Leaks: A Journalistic Dilemma in the Trump Era\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous political landscape of the Trump administration, the role of anonymous sources has come under scrutiny, as the media continues to rely on these unnamed individuals to provide insights into the inner workings of the White House. The constant stream of leaks, from the early days of the presidency, has painted a picture of a chaotic and potentially dangerous administration, with stories of a president seemingly out of his depth, a National Security Council in disarray, and key personnel under threat.\n\nHowever, the reliance on anonymous sources has raised questions about the credibility and motivations of these individuals. With vague descriptions and competing narratives, it becomes difficult to verify the accuracy of the information being presented. The use of anonymous sourcing has been a staple of journalism, but in this context, it has led to a growing sense of distrust among the public.\n\nThe gravity of the accusations against the Trump administration is such that the continued anonymity of these sources is concerning. If the administration is indeed a threat to constitutional governance and the nation's security, one would expect these sources to come forward, to provide the public with a chance to evaluate their credibility and motivations.\n\nThe use of anonymous sources in this context raises questions about the integrity of the sources themselves. Are they career civil servants, partisan bureaucrats, or political appointees jockeying for position? Are they truth-tellers, or are they manipulating the media to further their own agendas?\n\nThe public's trust in the political elite has been eroded in recent years, with perceptions of self-interest and career protection overriding a commitment to serving the public. The use of the media as a tool in bureaucratic wars does little to dispel this perception. If these sources believe the truth is important enough, they should be willing to go on the record, giving the public a chance to test their credibility.\n\nIn a time when the stakes are high and the nation's future hangs in the balance, the public deserves transparency and accountability. The use of anonymous sources, while a necessary tool in journalism, should be employed judiciously and with a clear understanding of the potential consequences. The public has a right to know the truth, and those who know it have a responsibility to share it, not to further their own careers, but to serve the public and uphold the principles of democracy.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Border Funding Bill Approved by House, Sent to President Trump for Signature\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan move, a coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans approved a crucial border funding legislation late Thursday in the House, sending the $4.6 billion bill to President Trump's desk for his expected signature. The bill, which was initially rejected by the House, was later approved after Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to bring the bipartisan Senate-passed bill to a vote without the inclusion of certain immigration enforcement restrictions.\n\nThe Senate had demonstrated bipartisan support for the bill by approving it 84-8 on Wednesday, following the rejection of an earlier House version. The House vote was a response to the urgent need to provide funding to help children caught in the humanitarian crisis at the southern border.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi, in a letter to colleagues, wrote, \"In order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill.\" She added, \"As we pass the Senate bill, we will do so with a Battle Cry as to how we go forward to protect children in a way that truly honors their dignity and worth.\"\n\nThe decision to pass the Senate bill without the additional restrictions has sparked unrest within the Democratic caucus, with some progressive members, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, expressing their opposition. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, \"That\u2019s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do.\"\n\nMeasures sought by liberal members included those to ensure the health and safety of those in custody, limit the amount of time unaccompanied minors can spend at an influx shelter to 90 days, and reduce funding for ICE by $81 million.\n\nThe rapid-fire sequence of events Thursday afternoon came after Republicans persistently called on House Democrats to pass the Senate bill in its \"clean\" form, noting that the White House said it would sign that bill. The White House had threatened to veto the House version.\n\nThe White House, in a statement, accused Democrats of delaying help for the children and refusing to work with Republicans. \"We have already negotiated a broadly supported bipartisan funding bill. It is time for House Democrats to pass the Senate bill and stop delaying funding to deal with this very real humanitarian crisis,\" the statement said.\n\nThe approval of the bill comes amid continued reports of poor and unsanitary conditions at detention centers, with the publication of an image of a migrant and his daughter found drowned in the Rio Grande only fueling the debate nationally. Republicans have continued to focus on closing loopholes that encourage migrants to make the perilous journey with children through Central America in order to be released into the U.S.",
    " Title: RNC Data Shows Improved Financial Situation for Voters in Key Battleground States, Boosting Trump's 2020 Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump continues, the Democratic Party expresses growing concerns about their ability to defeat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. With the Iowa Caucus less than 12 weeks away and the Democratic field still crowded, the Trump campaign is focusing on reminding the American people of the President's promises made during the 2016 election and fulfilled in his term.\n\nThe Trump administration has delivered on tax cuts, unemployment rates have reached record lows, particularly for Hispanics and African Americans, and the Senate has confirmed 99 judges, with more to follow for the remainder of the year. New data from the Republican National Committee (RNC) shows that Americans are experiencing the benefits of having President Trump in office.\n\nIn three key battleground states \u2013 New Hampshire, Michigan, and Pennsylvania \u2013 voters report being financially better off today than they were three years ago. In Michigan, voters are 17 percent more likely to believe they are better off financially, with this number rising to 22 percent for voters under 35 years old and 22 percent for those residing in Macomb County, part of the Detroit metro area.\n\nIn New Hampshire, voters are 33 percent more likely to believe they are better off financially, with working moms in the state being 31 percent more likely to feel their financial situation has improved since Trump took office. For voters in rural Coos County, it's 34 percent more likely. In Pennsylvania, voters are 20 percent more likely to agree that they are better off than they were three years ago, with this number rising to 25 percent for voters under 35 years old and 18 percent for working moms in the state.\n\nThe RNC has invested over $350 million in data that tracks key issues in every state, allowing their data and analytics team to closely monitor electorates and the issues that are important to them. Bill Skelly, CEO of Causeway Solutions, a leader in the data field, praises the RNC's data as \"unmatched.\"\n\n\"I work with RNC voter data every day, and the quality and breadth of information is unmatched,\" Skelly told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The data is refreshed daily with information collected through the tireless efforts of RNC-led volunteers, activists, and campaigns out there making phone calls and knocking on the doors of real voters in real time.\"\n\nThe RNC provides this data to campaigns at the federal, state, and local levels free of charge, asking only for Republicans across the country to keep the data up-to-date when they knock on doors and phone bank.\n\n\"Instead of paying for data, the GOP candidates and organizations use sweat equity to improve it,\" Skelly said. \"It is the secret weapon Republicans all over the country are able to deploy to win their political battles.\"",
    " Title: Trump's 2020 Reelection Prospects: A Historical and Contemporary Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of 2020, President Donald Trump's reelection prospects appear strong, with his most likely opponent being the unapologetic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders. This analysis examines five historical arguments that favor Trump's reelection bid.\n\nFirst, Trump's status as an incumbent gives him an advantage. Since 1900, incumbent presidents have won 14 out of 19 reelection bids. The few who lost did not enjoy positive approval ratings. In a Gallup poll from earlier this month, Trump enjoyed his highest approval rating since his inauguration, with a 49 percent favorable rating versus 50 percent unfavorable.\n\nSecond, the public's perception of the economy typically determines presidential elections. Currently, the U.S. is experiencing low inflation, low interest rates, positive economic growth, near-record low unemployment, rising workers' wages, and record gas and oil production.\n\nThird, historical precedent shows that wars and scandals can derail a presidency. However, Trump's record suggests that he is unlikely to favor preemptive attacks, nation-building, or the use of U.S. ground troops in large numbers.\n\nFourth, scandals can also destroy a presidency. Yet, Trump has been acquitted by the Senate following impeachment proceedings and the Mueller report found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nFifth, the opponent matters. The election of 1964 was a sure thing for Lyndon Johnson due to the caricature of Barry Goldwater as an out-of-touch extremist. Similarly, George McGovern's radicalism ensured Richard Nixon's reelection in 1972.\n\nTrump's poll numbers have climbed steadily since the impeachment proceedings began in September 2019. He now has far more campaign money than in 2016 and the full backing of the Republican Party. Unlike in 2016, he also has a mostly positive record of economic achievement and governing experience.\n\nHowever, the U.S. continues to borrow about $1 trillion per year, and Trump has followed the profligate spending habits of his predecessors. The global economy, particularly China, could impact the U.S. economy. If the Chinese economy crashes, it could take down global commerce a notch.\n\nIn the Democratic camp, the election appears to be Trump's to lose, given the current state of the candidates. Bernie Sanders' radical agendas turn off a majority of the public, and even mainstream Democrats are terrified of his redistribution schemes. Joe Biden's campaign has been hurt by revelations about his son Hunter's Ukrainian dealings, and Mike Bloomberg's first debate was a disaster. Bloomberg's moderate stance and unlimited financial resources are overshadowed by his inconsistencies and reckless speech.\n\nIn conclusion, if one looks at 2020 dispassionately and historically, the election appears to be Trump's to lose. However, the election is still several months away, and the dynamics of the race could change.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Critiques Media Bias in New Book, Accuses Fox News of Propaganda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her recently published book, \"What Happened,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused the media of a \"right-wing war on truth.\" The book, however, has drawn criticism for its one-sided view of the media, with some arguing that it reflects a long-standing distrust of the press that Clinton has held for over two decades.\n\nClinton's book, in particular, targets elements of the left-leaning media, including the New York Times, and criticizes Fox News as the \"most powerful and prominent platform for the right-wing war on truth.\" In an interview with her former Obama colleagues on the podcast \"Pod Save America,\" Clinton described Fox News as a \"dedicated propaganda channel.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton's criticism of Fox News is not entirely accurate, as the network's news division, including anchors such as Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, are known for playing it straight. Clinton's failure to distinguish between the news division and the network's conservative commentators has led some to question the validity of her claims.\n\nClinton's book also touches on the issue of media polarization, stating that by 2016, most liberals and conservatives were getting their news from distinctly different sources and no longer shared a common set of facts. While this statement is true, Clinton's blame for the polarization phenomenon is misplaced, as there is no polarization whatsoever at left-leaning outlets.\n\nClinton's book also criticizes the media for their coverage of her during the 2016 campaign, particularly during the Commander-in-Chief Forum, where she was questioned about her email scandal. Clinton accused NBC's Matt Lauer of being tougher on her than Donald Trump, but this claim is disputed by many, including a number of mainstream outlets.\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton's book, \"What Happened,\" offers a critical view of the media, particularly Fox News, and accuses the network of being a \"dedicated propaganda channel.\" However, the book's portrayal of the media is one-sided and fails to acknowledge the role of left-leaning outlets in the polarization of the media landscape. Additionally, Clinton's criticism of the media during the 2016 campaign is not entirely accurate, as she was questioned about her email scandal by both Fox News and other mainstream outlets.",
    " Title: White House, New York City Mayor's Office Receive Threatening Letters Containing Ricin\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House and New York City Mayor's office have become the latest targets of letters containing the poison ricin, similar to the ones sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York last week. The Secret Service confirmed on Thursday that a letter addressed to President Obama was intercepted at the White House mail screening facility.\n\nThe Secret Service stated, \"We can confirm that the White House mail screening facility intercepted a letter addressed to the White House... similar to letters previously addressed to Mayor Bloomberg in New York. This letter has been turned over to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force for testing and investigation.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said all presidential mail is examined at an off-site facility. \"We have precautions in place for these kinds of things,\" Earnest said.\n\nThe letter to Obama was discovered on Wednesday. Federal officials close to the investigation said there had been a heightened sense of alert because of the Bloomberg letters. They said the Obama letter appeared to have the same postmark and handwriting as the ones sent to Bloomberg and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, based in Washington.\n\nThe letter to Obama was not opened before it was shipped out for testing, the officials said.\n\nRep. Pete King, R-N.Y., said in a CNN interview that law enforcement officials had told him all three letters \"are virtually identical,\" cautioning that the investigation was still in its early stages.\n\nThe other letters, postmarked May 20 in Shreveport, La., were opened in New York on Friday at the city's mail facility in Manhattan and in Washington on Sunday at an office of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.\n\nNew York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the same machine or computer had produced the two letters to Bloomberg and the similar one to Obama and that they may be identical.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI announced Thursday another letter with the poison ricin had been mailed to Obama from Spokane, Wash., and was intercepted May 22. Authorities have arrested a man in Spokane in connection with that letter.\n\nCNN, citing a source with knowledge of the letters to Bloomberg and his gun-control group, said those letters include this:\n\n\"You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. Anyone wants to come to my house will get shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right till the day I die.\"\n\nBloomberg said the letters \"referred to our anti-gun efforts,\" but he added, \"There's 12,000 people that are going to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts.\"\n\nNew York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne would not confirm the language in the letters, but he said the \"subject matter was gun-owner rights and they contained the same threatening language.\"\n\nThe letters addressed to Bloomberg and Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, both tested positive for ricin, Browne said. More testing was scheduled.\n\nThree New York officers involved in the case experienced mild diarrhea Saturday, a minor symptom of ricin exposure, Browne said. In Washington, Glaze showed no symptoms after opening that letter, the group said.\n\nBloomberg ranks among the nation's most outspoken gun-control advocates. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was co-founded in 2006 by Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who serve as its co-chairs. It claims a membership of more than 850 mayors in 44 states.\n\nShreveport (La.) Mayor Cedric Glover said Shreveport police are working with the FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force to determine who sent the letters and where the ricin came from.\n\n\"We are also taking the necessary steps to protect United States Postal Service... as well as any of our citizens from any potential harm,\" Glover said.\n\nRicin naturally occurs in castor beans and can be fatal if inhaled or ingested. Ricin-tainted threats have been sent recently to Obama, lawmakers, and judges.\n\nLast week, a Washington state man was accused of including ricin in a death threat mailed to a federal judge. Matthew Buquet, 38, of Spokane, was being held without bond.\n\nIn late April, a Mississippi man was arrested on charges of mailing poisoned letters to Obama, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, and an 80-year-old judge in Tupelo, Miss. The FBI said Everett Dutschke, 41, bought castor bean seeds online late last year. Agents found traces of ricin on several objects retrieved from trash at his Tupelo home and near his martial-arts studio.",

In a separate meeting with Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Gorsuch reportedly said, \"Any attack on any of \u2014 I think his word to me was \u2014 'brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.'\"\n\nPresident Trump has responded to the revelation, stating that the comments were \"mischaracterized.\" Trump also took the opportunity to attack Senator Blumenthal, who was discovered to have falsely claimed military service during his 2010 Senate campaign.\n\nTrump's attacks on the judiciary are unusual for a sitting president. Gorsuch, who has been a federal judge since 2006, is being considered for his independence should he be on the Supreme Court.\n\nLast Friday, Trump launched his attack on the judiciary with tweets disparaging federal Judge James L. Robart, who temporarily blocked the president's ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trump's comments on Judge Robart have been met with criticism, with many viewing them as an attack on the judiciary's independence.\n\nAt a Thursday afternoon press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended Gorsuch, stating that the judge was not specifically commenting on Trump's tweet about the \"so-called\" Judge Robart. However, this statement contradicts Republican Senator Sasse's account of their talk.\n\nThe controversy over Senator Blumenthal's military service record also resurfaced during the discussion. Blumenthal had claimed to have served in Vietnam, but it was later discovered that he had received several deferments and served in the Marine reserves, though not overseas. Blumenthal later apologized and said he meant to say, \"I served during Vietnam.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's tweet about the controversy over his military record, Trump sent out another tweet falsely claiming CNN did not ask Blumenthal about the issue. Blumenthal responded to Trump's tweet in an interview on CNN.",
    " Title: French Police Officer Honored as National Hero After Sacrificing Himself in Supermarket Siege\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the small town of Trebes, France, Col. Arnaud Beltrame, a decorated French police officer, was hailed as a national hero on Saturday following his selfless actions during a deadly supermarket siege on Friday. Beltrame, who was among the first responders to the attack, died of his injuries, raising the death toll to four.\n\nCol. Beltrame, a member of the elite police special forces since 2003, had organized a hostage situation training session in December, arming his officers with paintball guns to simulate real-life conditions. When he entered the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Morocco-born gunman, Beltrame left his cellphone on, allowing police outside to hear the unfolding events inside the store. Police stormed the building when they heard gunshots, and Beltrame was fatally wounded.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Beltrame, stating, \"Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much. In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.\"\n\nMacron also announced that Beltrame was married with no children. The president added that investigators would focus on establishing how the gunman, identified as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, obtained his weapon and became radicalized.\n\nThe four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person and wounding another. Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers near Carcassonne, wounding one. He then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, shooting and killing two people and taking hostages.\n\nLakdim, who was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing, was under surveillance and on the Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism. Despite this, there was no apparent warning sign that Lakdim would carry out an attack.\n\nA woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise. The authorities are still investigating the motives behind the attack.\n\nFrance has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Requests IRS Official's Personal Email Documents Amid Probe into Targeting of Tea Party Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has requested documents from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official Lois Lerner, who is at the center of an ongoing investigation into the agency's targeting of Tea Party groups. The committee's inquiry stems from allegations that Lerner used her personal email account for official business.\n\nThe request, addressed to Lerner, states that she sent documents related to her official duties from her IRS email account to an account labeled 'Lois Home.' Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., wrote, \"This raises some serious questions. To understand the extent to which you may have used a non-official email account for official purposes, we request that you produce all documents and communications housed in your msn.com account.\"\n\nIssa suggested that such activity could potentially violate federal records requirements, create difficulties in filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and hinder congressional oversight obligations.\n\nThe IRS admitted this spring that it had targeted Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations when they were applying for nonprofit status from 2010 to 2012. Lerner, the former director of the agency's Exempt Organizations unit, invoked her Fifth Amendment rights in May when called before Congress to testify on the issue. She has since been on paid leave.\n\nIssa and subcommittee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have given Lerner until Aug. 27 to comply with the request, which also covers any other non-official account that references Lerner's official IRS duties. A committee spokesman told FoxNews.com that such documents could be subpoenaed but declined to say whether investigators would take such action.\n\nAn IRS spokesman said agency officials are awaiting receipt of the letter and will review it. The targeting, which delayed groups learning whether they would be granted tax-exempt status, sparked public outrage and several other probes, including one by the FBI. The House oversight committee, as recently as this month, complained that acting IRS Commissioner Danny Wurfel has failed to comply promptly with requests to supply documents related to the investigation.",
    " Title: Battleground Poll Predicts Romney Victory in 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 election approaches, the race between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney remains tight, with the latest polls showing a close contest. In a bipartisan poll conducted by the GWU Battleground, Romney is leading Obama by a single point, 49 to 48 percent. However, the poll's internal data suggests a more significant lead for Romney.\n\nThe poll's \"vote election model\" takes into account variables such as voter intensity, age, education, and certainty in vote. When these factors are considered, Romney emerges with a five-point national lead, 52 percent to 47 percent. The poll also indicates that Romney has a more substantial advantage among middle-class voters, with 52 percent support compared to Obama's 45 percent.\n\nThe GWU Battleground poll's findings are intriguing, as they show a one-point lead for Obama in the surface data, but a relatively comfortable Romney win when the model's variables are taken into account. This discrepancy between the surface data and the model's results is what has led to the \"excruciating and contradictory\" nature of the poll-watching process during the 2012 election.\n\nThe poll's methodology is not publicly available, but it is worth noting that other polls, such as Gallup and Rasmussen, have shown a shift in party identification among the 2012 electorate. In the current tracking poll, Gallup finds that the 10-point advantage for Democrats has turned into a one-point Republican advantage. The current party breakdown is 35 percent Democrats, 36 percent Republicans, and 29 percent independents.\n\nSimilarly, Rasmussen's daily tracking poll shows Republicans now edging Democrats by 2.6 points, with a split of 34 percent Democrats, 37 percent Republicans, and 29 percent independents. This shift in party identification may be a factor in the Battleground poll's projection of a Romney win.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2012 presidential election remains a tight race, with both candidates vying for every vote. The GWU Battleground poll's \"vote election model\" suggests a five-point lead for Mitt Romney, but the race remains close in the surface data. As the election draws near, it is essential to stay informed and consider multiple sources of data to make an informed decision.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Challenges in Testing and Supply Acquisition as States Lift Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting of the interagency group on May 1, officials discussed the ongoing challenges in testing and supply acquisition as states begin to lift their distancing restrictions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are working together to ensure a \"locally executive, state managed, and federally supported response\" to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFEMA spokesperson stated that the current global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies outweighs the supply, not just in the U.S., but across the globe. The administration is working to ensure federal contracting efforts don't compete with states' abilities to acquire PPE and other supplies.\n\nThe nation's testing figures have risen over the last month, but public health experts agree that the U.S. is still not testing enough people to have an accurate picture of the virus' spread. The administration is shifting its efforts from scrambling to import supplies to trying to boost domestic production of key materials like protective equipment.\n\nRegional officials reported continued increases in both cases and deaths as governors moved to terminate stay-at-home orders. New hot spots were identified in prisons, meat processing plants, and other high-risk facilities. Some states, such as South Carolina and Georgia, were planning to reopen despite logging zero consecutive days of decreasing cases, according to one slide distributed to the group.\n\nPresident Trump has praised states' push to reopen, but on the same day as regional officials expressed concerns in the meeting, the president said that states moving too fast by opening businesses like tattoo parlors and nail salons.\n\nHealth officials are scrambling to stand up new tools to monitor for outbreaks and are pulling data from various parts of the government in an attempt to respond to the increased demand and burden on the system. The officials also confronted a particularly bleak scenario: that the fresh waves of coronavirus cases could threaten to overwhelm the nation's health system once again.\n\nThe U.S. has nearly 104,000 ventilators, according to one slide distributed to the group, but only about 30,000 were currently in use. The officials warned of a potential ventilator crisis if Americans quickly resumed their pre-pandemic lives, with the rash of new cases maxing out and soon exceeding the nation's ventilator supplies by the first week of June. The officials emphasized the need for continuous monitoring and the possibility of another damaging lockdown if the health system is overwhelmed.",
    " Title: Unraveling the Ottawa Shooting: A Comprehensive Overview of the Recent Attacks in Canada\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting at the Canadian National War Memorial that left an army reservist dead, many questions remain unanswered. This article aims to provide a neutral and factual account of the events, the known details, and the unknown aspects of the Ottawa shooting.\n\nWhat we know:\n- The attack at the Canadian Parliament on Wednesday resulted in the death of Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian army reservist. This was preceded by an incident on Monday in Quebec where a man, reportedly radicalized, hit a soldier with his car, resulting in the soldier's death.\n- The attacker's passport was confiscated before the attack, and there was no immediate indication that the two incidents were related.\n- The U.S. heightened security at the Ottawa embassy and another consulate in Canada following jihadist chatter indicating an attack could be imminent.\n- The gunman was acting alone, according to Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson.\n- Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms of Canada's House of Commons, is credited with bringing down the gunman.\n\nWhat we do not know:\n- The gunman's motive for the shooting.\n- Why the gunman changed his name to Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, but two sources told CNN that he converted to Islam.\n- Details on how Kevin Vickers stopped the gunman.\n- Whether the gunman had any ties to any group or groups.\n- Why the gunman shot Nathan Cirillo in the back while he stood guard at the National War Memorial.\n\nAs the investigation continues, more details are expected to emerge, providing a clearer picture of the events that transpired. This week's events serve as a grim reminder that Canada, like other parts of the world, is not immune to terrorist attacks. The Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, emphasized that \"in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.\"",
    " Title: Ohio Senate Race: Sherrod Brown and Josh Mandel Face Off in Crucial Election Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a pivotal battle for the Ohio Senate seat, incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican challenger Josh Mandel hit the campaign trail this week. The state, a crucial battleground in the presidential election and a potential deciding factor in maintaining Democratic control of the Senate, is the focus of intense political activity.\n\nOn Thursday, President Obama is scheduled to visit Ohio, following in the footsteps of Mandel, who is vying to unseat Brown. Mandel has been emphasizing Brown's strong support for the Affordable Care Act, with assistance from outside groups.\n\nIn Cleveland's West Side, Brown, during a visit to the West Side Market, touted a federal grant that aids vendors in accepting food stamps. However, the conversation soon shifted to campaign matters and Mandel, a name Brown did not mention.\n\n\"The difference between me and my opponent, by and large, is that I wake up every day trying to figure out how to create jobs,\" Brown said. \"My opponent wakes up every day and figures out what office to run for next, and that really is the contrast. I'm doing my job every day. That's why it's no surprise when you pick a day to come out here that I'm doing my work, not campaigning.\"\n\nBrown, who voted for the Affordable Care Act, is pleased that most of it was upheld by the Supreme Court. However, he declined to discuss whether he would campaign on the widely unpopular law.\n\n\"My view is there are so many good things in it, I supported it and will continue to,\" he said. \"But it's important that the politics stop here, that instead of people trying to get political benefit from this, that we move on and focus on what we ought to be doing, and that's job creation.\"\n\nSome shoppers expressed a desire for Brown to discuss the health care law more openly.\n\n\"He voted for it,\" said Nancy Wassen, a Democrat from Ashland. \"I think he kind of has to at least include that in what he talks about.\"\n\nLaura Dorrie, a retired teacher and undecided independent, shared similar sentiments. \"Right now, there are a lot of people that are against Obamacare, so I'm not sure that that's the wisest decision to make,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, in the working-class Cleveland suburb of Parma, there was a large turnout at the Fourth of July parade, which Obama plans to visit on Thursday. Mandel is expected to precede the president.\n\nMandel, a 34-year-old former Marine intelligence officer and Tea Party favorite, has been emphasizing Brown's vote for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown held in his hands the power to stop this government-run health care act,\" Mandel said, \"but instead of stopping it, he cast the deciding vote on the federal government's takeover of health care.\"\n\nThe independent fact-checking group Politifact has labeled this \"deciding vote\" claim as false. Mandel has also made questionable claims regarding campaign spending, stating that he is the underdog in terms of funding.\n\nRecords provided by the Brown campaign show that outside groups backing Mandel have spent nearly five times more than groups backing Brown.\n\n\"You have certainly more money being spent by the Republicans,\" said Ken Goldstein of Kantar Media Group, which tracks TV ad spending in the Ohio Senate race. \"And most of that is due to the group spending that is being done on Josh Mandel's part.\"\n\nNearly $10 million worth of TV ads paid for by outside groups and favoring Mandel have already aired in Ohio, including one from Crossroads GPS that states it's no surprise Brown voted for Obamacare: \"He supports Obama's agenda 95 percent of the time.\"\n\nGroups such as Crossroads GPS do not have to disclose their donors. Brown suspects the money is coming from business groups opposed to his union-friendly voting record.\n\n\"I mean, I know who doesn't like me from outside the state,\" he said. \"But I think this money is really all about this. Without that outside money for my opponent, this wouldn't be much of a race.\"\n\nRecent polls show Brown ahead of Mandel by single digits, a gap that is narrowing as outside money continues to pour in.",
    " Title: Mueller Investigation: Experts Predict Significant New Developments in 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the new year approaches, legal experts and observers are predicting that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign will advance significantly, potentially targeting President Donald Trump himself or members of his family.\n\nThe investigation, which has been notoriously leak-proof, has been ongoing for two years, and its progress has been largely obscured from the public eye. However, analysts interviewed by various news outlets warn that Mueller's velocity and vector are essentially unknowable, as his team does not leak private information, while salient public information is open to interpretation.\n\nOne of the biggest questions surrounding the investigation pertains to whether Mueller will present evidence that Trump committed crimes, such as obstruction of justice or collusion. Alex Whiting, a Harvard law professor and former prosecutor on the international criminal court, stated, \"I think the biggest question is, is he going to present evidence that Trump committed crimes? Either obstruction of justice or collusion. He wouldn't bring an indictment because justice department policy won't permit it. But whatever evidence would be handed off, I think, to the Congress, and it will have to be considered.\"\n\nMueller's investigation has produced several significant developments in 2018, including the April raid on former Trump fixer Michael Cohen's home and the fiery sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn earlier this month. However, the public has gained a limited view of the progress of Mueller's core investigation into election tampering and potential obstruction.\n\nFor example, a Mueller memo describing Flynn's \"valuable\" cooperation was almost entirely redacted in sections describing Russia-related matters. Similarly, a Cohen memo was adamantly non-specific in its description of \"core\" investigative matters that Cohen helped with.\n\nOne of the most revealing Mueller documents to emerge was a draft plea agreement with conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, which revealed that Mueller alleged that Corsi helped Trump political adviser Roger Stone communicate with WikiLeaks, which served during the election as a Russian cutout.\n\nAnalysts suggest that if Trump himself is the biggest target Mueller might approach in 2019, lower-level targets such as Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could also be targeted. Both men appear to be legally exposed to charges of making false statements either to investigators or to Congress.\n\nBarb McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor and former US attorney, pointed to Mueller's description of Cohen's cooperation and noted that Cohen had \"described the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries\" \u2013 a response he later admitted was false.\n\n\"That suggests there were others who were trying to get their story straight,\" said McQuade. \"And I imagine that that would be an area that Mueller would look at, to say: 'Well, Michael Cohen told a lie. Did anyone else tell the same lie?'\"\n\nMajor incidents before or after the last US presidential election could emerge as focal points for Mueller in the new year. The special counsel might reveal new evidence about the circumstances surrounding a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, or a February 2017 meeting between Trump and Comey, at which Comey said that Trump encouraged him to drop an investigation of Flynn.\n\nFurther criminal charges might emerge in the case of hush payments made to the porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, or new details might emerge of projects or prospective projects advanced by Trump and his family in Moscow or the Middle East. In the background would be questions about the nature of the Trump campaign's relationships at the time with any foreign backers.\n\nForeign countries and nationals are not supposed to be involved in US campaigns or elections.\n\n\"We all at this moment know very little about where Robert Mueller's investigation will lead, because it has been so leak-free and they have been so careful about keeping their cards very close to the vest, and admirably so,\" said Lisa K Griffin, a law professor at Duke University with a focus on federal criminal justice policy.\n\n\"I don't think anyone knows, and I think most of the conjecture about it has been wishful thinking in both directions.\"\n\nWhiting concluded, \"Trump has tried repeatedly to minimize this investigation, to delegitimize it, to dismiss it, and that hasn't worked and it's not going to work. I think this investigation and the consequences are going to be significant and they're here to stay, and there's nothing he can do about it.\"",
    " Title: Arkansas Oil Spill from ExxonMobil's Pegasus Pipeline Stirs Controversy over Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of an oil spill from ExxonMobil's Pegasus pipeline in Arkansas, the small town of Mayflower has been affected, with over 20 families evacuated due to the incident. The company estimates that \"a few thousand barrels of oil\" were spilled in the area. This incident, occurring at a time when the oil and gas industry and other proponents of the Keystone XL pipeline are enjoying growing bipartisan support in Congress, has become a fresh point of contention in the ongoing debate.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, which aims to transport the same Canadian oil sands as the Pegasus pipeline, has been a contentious issue for years. The Mayflower spill and the subsequent cleanup effort are being used by critics as evidence of the potential risks associated with large-scale pipeline projects.\n\nMichael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, stated, \"This latest toxic mess is just another reminder that oil companies can not be trusted to transport toxic tar sands crude through Americans' backyards. It's not a matter of if spills will occur on dangerous pipelines like the Keystone XL, but rather, when.\"\n\nRep. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and candidate for his state's open U.S. Senate seat, echoed similar sentiments. \"Whether it's the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or this mess in Arkansas, Americans are realizing that transporting large amounts of this corrosive and polluting fuel is a bad deal for American taxpayers and for our environment,\" he said in a statement.\n\nEnvironmental groups argue that the thick Canadian oil sands could pose unique dangers to pipelines due to faster corrosion and other factors. The exact cause of the spill, ExxonMobil stated, remains under investigation.\n\nThe Arkansas spill is the latest in a series of incidents raised by Keystone critics to demonstrate pipeline safety concerns and other dangers associated with crude oil transport. Critics are also pointing to last week's rupture of a Chevron Corp. pipeline in Utah, the derailment of a southbound train carrying Canadian oil sands through Minnesota last week, and numerous other incidents over the past few years.\n\nThe Arkansas spill comes as President Obama is set to hear from the environmental movement once again. Liberal activist group Credo, the Sierra Club, and others have organized a protest in front of a Democratic Party fundraiser in San Francisco, an event the president is scheduled to attend. Credo has also promised to mobilize more than 50,000 activists for \"civil disobedience\" if President Obama approves the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nSupport for the pipeline had been increasing both in Congress and among voters, though it remains to be seen whether that support will erode due to the Arkansas incident. A March 28 Rasmussen survey found that 58 percent of likely U.S. voters support building the pipeline, while just 26 percent are opposed to it. The poll also reported that, despite the demonstrations and protests of the environmental movement, the real passion lies on the pro-Keystone side of the debate. One-third of likely voters \"strongly favor\" building the pipeline, while just 12 percent \"strongly oppose\" it, according to the survey.",
    " Title: Benghazi Committee Requests Transcribed Interview with Hillary Clinton over Email Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Benghazi investigative committee has formally requested a transcribed interview with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss her decision-making process regarding the emails she handed over to the government and why she chose to wipe her email server clean. The request comes as the State Department begins to disclose some of Clinton's emails that she had kept hidden for years.\n\nIn a letter to Clinton's attorney, Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, stated that Clinton's \"unique arrangement with herself\" needs to be explained, as nobody other than Clinton can do that. The interview would be conducted behind closed doors but would be part of the committee's investigation's record. A public hearing would follow once the select investigative committee has gathered all necessary documents, according to Gowdy.\n\nGowdy expressed concern over several questions regarding Clinton's email arrangement, including why she refused a government-issued account and set up her own account and server, why she kept the emails instead of turning them over to the State Department upon leaving office in early 2013, and how she decided which of the 62,000 emails from her time in office she would delete and which she would turn over.\n\nGowdy also made it clear that since the emails are under committee investigation, any action to destroy them would be illegal. He stated that is why Clinton must turn over her server to a neutral third party, a request Clinton's team has rejected, stating she has already complied with the law.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill stated that Clinton looks forward to a public hearing, but did not address Gowdy's request for a transcribed interview. The White House, which has tried to keep the Clinton email situation at arm's length, declined to comment on the Benghazi committee's request.\n\nClinton has previously stated that she used an email server she set up at her home in New York, and issued herself her own email address, because she wanted to use a single device and account for both personal and private mail. She has said she determined that about 30,000 of her 62,000 emails from her time in office were government-related, and in December, nearly two years after she left office, she turned those over to the State Department amid prodding by the Benghazi committee.\n\nThe emails Clinton turned over amounted to 55,000 pages. The State Department stated this week that it will take several months to process those emails because it needs to scan the pages to create digital files and then needs to run them by authorities to determine what can be released publicly.\n\nIn a court filing this week, the Obama administration stated it wants to rush production of all of those emails online and rejected a request from a conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, for a quick turnaround on an open-records request. The State Department didn't apply that to all requests. The Associated Press reported Tuesday morning that the department had released four of Clinton's emails to the news organization, including one that showed Clinton used an iPad in addition to her mobile phone for sending emails. This contradicts one of Clinton's justifications for having a single account.\n\nJudicial Watch has multiple outstanding requests for Clinton emails. Its president, Tom Fitton, stated, \"It is not a matter of playing favorites; it is a matter of further harming [through delay] our right to know under the Freedom of Information Act, which the agency has trashed.\"",
    " Title: Edward Snowden's Complex Journey to U.S. Courts: A Labyrinthine Path for the NSA Whistleblower\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, is navigating a complex path towards U.S. courts as he seeks asylum in a country like Iceland. In an interview with The Guardian, Snowden, a 29-year-old former Booz Allen Hamilton employee, expressed his hope to find refuge in a country that values transparency and freedom of speech.\n\nSnowden's situation is distinct from that of Bradley Manning, the army private currently on trial at Fort Meade, Maryland. Manning faces life imprisonment for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks, but as a member of the military, he is being tried via court-martial. Unlike Manning, Snowden did not sell the secrets or give them to a foreign power, so he will not be subject to the severe penalties of the espionage laws, as Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames were when they were caught spying.\n\nThe Justice Department can charge Snowden, indict him, and leave the charge hanging, but to pursue him further, he would need to be brought back to U.S. soil. The extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong contains an exception for political crimes, a category Snowden's admitted acts would likely fall under. However, Hong Kong could choose to simply expel him without handing him over to American authorities.\n\nThe questions surrounding Snowden's status become even more complicated in light of the recent summit between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at improving relations between the two countries. Turning Snowden over to the Americans could have significant diplomatic consequences, while remanding him to the United States might serve as a gesture of good faith for the Chinese, but would likely require high-level negotiations.\n\nThe United States does not have a separate extradition treaty with China. If Snowden can find refuge in a Hong Kong consulate of a nation that will welcome him, he could potentially stay there indefinitely without being captured by U.S. or Chinese officials, similar to Julian Assange's situation in London.\n\nRyan Scoville, an expert in international law at Marquette University Law School, believes it is unlikely that another country would shelter Snowden and bear the political costs of harboring such a high-profile American wanted by the U.S. government. However, the possibility remains, as evidenced by Assange's experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Edward Snowden's journey to U.S. courts is a complex and uncertain one, fraught with diplomatic implications and legal complexities. His case serves as a testament to the intricacies of international law and the challenges faced by whistleblowers in the digital age.",
    " Title: Shift in Polls Favors Clinton and Democrats in Down-Ballot Races\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest polls indicate a significant lead for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump. The ABC tracking poll, designated as A plus by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com, shows Clinton with a 12-point lead over Trump, a margin larger than in most other polls. The average across all polls has Clinton's percentage up by a comfortable margin that seems to be increasing.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's model, which averages polls, shows Clinton with an 85 percent probability of winning and is currently ahead by 6.6 points. The New York Times Upshot, on the other hand, has a 92 percent probability of a Clinton win, with all predictions showing Clinton with 85 percent or higher.\n\nFor down-ballot races, the situation appears promising for the Democrats, with a decent possibility of winning the Senate if they retain the White House. However, this outcome is not guaranteed, and some analysts suggest the possibility of ticket splitting, where voters support Clinton but also vote for a Republican incumbent senator.\n\nThe House, on the other hand, has been considered out of reach for the Democrats due to gerrymandering and population patterns. However, some experts suggest that if Clinton wins the national popular vote by 8 percent or more, there might be a chance for Democrats to take control of the House. In national polls, Clinton is currently ahead by 5 percent, and former President Obama outperformed his 2012 polls by 3 percent, making it plausible for Democrats to surpass the 8 percent mark.\n\nThe dramatic shift in October can be attributed to several factors. Clinton had been leading throughout the summer, but her lead diminished after the first debate on Sept. 26, with FiveThirtyEight giving Trump a 51 percent chance of winning. The candidates were tied nationally at 45 percent, and the trend was moving in Trump's favor.\n\nThe decline in Trump's poll numbers can be attributed to several factors, including revelations about Trump's horrifying misogyny and his ongoing inability to behave with any discipline. However, the debates also played a significant role in shaping public opinion. The first debate provided an opportunity for voters to see Clinton in action, reminding them of the characteristics that make her a formidable leader. When she stood face-to-face with Trump, it was clear that one of them was a president, and it was not him.",
    " Title: The Rising Skepticism Towards Government: A Look at Recent \"Accidents\" and Their Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of politics and governance, the concept of \"accidents\" has been a topic of increasing skepticism, as a series of seemingly inexplicable incidents have raised questions about the integrity of certain institutions and their handling of sensitive information.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the CIA inadvertently destroyed its only copy of a classified Senate report on torture, prompting concerns about the authenticity of the incident. This event follows a string of \"accidental\" losses of incriminating information by the IRS, despite court orders, Congressional inquiries, and widespread belief that these \"accidents\" were, in fact, the deliberate destruction of incriminating evidence.\n\nThe email scandal involving Hillary Clinton's private server, where emails were deleted and now emails from her IT guy have vanished, further fuels this skepticism. The question arises: why do these incidents occur, and what do they imply for the future of our society?\n\nPeople follow the law for a variety of reasons. Fear of punishment, agreement with the law, and a sense of duty to maintain a viable society are among the primary motivators. However, when those in power treat the law with contempt, it undermines the trust that forms the foundation of a high-trust society.\n\nGonzalo Lira, a writer who warned of a coming middle-class anarchy during the financial crisis, noted that law-abiding citizens are deciding that playing by the rules is a \"sucker's game.\" As trust in our society's leadership wanes, the risk of a shift towards a low-trust society increases.\n\nHigh-trust societies are generally more pleasant to live in, but they require a high level of trust among citizens. As our society's leadership continues to exhibit contempt for the law and the bourgeoisie, the risk of a shift towards a low-trust society increases.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, \u2588\u2588\u2588 publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

    " Title: Young and Energetic: Paul Ryan's Ascension to the GOP Ticket and Its Impact on Young Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the newly selected vice presidential running mate for Republican Mitt Romney, visited his alma mater, Miami University of Ohio, on Wednesday. Ryan, who graduated from the university in 1992 with degrees in economics and political science, is the nation's first vice presidential candidate from Generation X.\n\nRob Harrelson, a member of the school's College Republicans (as was Ryan, two decades earlier), expressed his excitement about Ryan's rise in the Republican Party and the House of Representatives. \"He's young, he's energetic, he's popular, he's rising through the ranks of the Republican Party and in the House,\" says Harrelson. \"I think he's a great candidate. He's bringing a lot of energy to the campaign.\"\n\nAt 42, Ryan's youth and ideas about the economy are expected to appeal to today's college students, according to Harrelson. \"I absolutely think that Ryan will appeal to the younger voters with his budget proposal,\" says Harrelson, speaking at Bagel and Deli in downtown Oxford, Ohio, packed with college students fresh off of summer vacation and parents helping them move into the dorms. \"It cuts government regulation. It cuts the red tape that's really crippling our economy, and I think that his plan will really resonate.\"\n\nHowever, the impact of Ryan's selection on young voters remains uncertain. In the 2008 election, only a third of voters under 30 voted for Sen. John McCain, which made for the largest disparity between young voters and other age groups since exit polling began in 1972.\n\nPatrick Haney, a professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio, is not sure if picking Ryan will make much of a difference in attracting young voters. \"That voting age group, certainly in the last election, skewed to Obama,\" says Haney. \"But they primarily skew toward not voting.\"\n\nAccording to census data, the youth turnout hit its third-highest rate ever in 2008 at 51 percent. Many expect that number to drop in 2012. Haney is not convinced that Ryan's selection will significantly impact youth turnout. \"So, you know, the question is\u2014is a pick like that meant to have some impact on younger voters who...I guess there was some evidence to suggest were tuning out of this election?\" says Haney. \"Maybe, but I tend to doubt that age had much to do with the pick.\"\n\nHaney suspects that Ryan's selection has more to do with energizing the Republican base than bringing out the youth vote. Ryan's stances on social issues like abortion and gay marriage are more in line with traditional religious conservatives than with typical college students. Haney adds that, like their elders, young voters usually do not focus on the lower half of the ticket.",
    " Title: FBI Officials' \"Secret Society\" Reference Under Scrutiny Amid Missing Text Messages\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo top FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who have been under fire for exchanging anti-Trump text messages during the 2016 election, are now under scrutiny for a \"secret society\" reference they made the day after President Donald Trump's victory. The revelation was made by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy and Rep. John Ratcliffe on Monday.\n\nAccording to Gowdy and Ratcliffe, the pair exchanged more than 50,000 messages, including references to a \"secret society\" within the Department of Justice and the FBI. The \"secret society\" reference occurred the day after Trump won the presidential election in November 2016.\n\n\"We learned today about information that in the immediate aftermath of [Trump's] election, that there may have been a secret society of folks within the Department of Justice and the FBI -- to include Page and Strzok -- that would be working against him,\" Ratcliffe said on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum.\"\n\nGowdy stated that the \"secret society\" reference was concerning because the FBI agents were supposed to be investigating Trump objectively after he won the Electoral College. \"So of course I'm going to want to know what secret society you're talking about because you're supposed to be investigating objectively the person who just won the Electoral College; so yeah I'm going to want to know,\" he said.\n\nThe missing texts between Strzok and Page are not the first time the messages have raised questions about what may have been going on at the FBI. In one previously released message, Strzok appeared to make a reference to an \"insurance policy\" against a Trump win.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has been under pressure from President Trump to fire FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is at the center of new tensions with the Trump administration. Axios reported late Monday that Sessions has been urging FBI Director Christopher Wray to fire McCabe. The outlet reported that Wray threatened to resign if McCabe was fired.\n\nThe developments come as the Department of Justice announced that the FBI \"failed to preserve\" five months of texts between Strzok and Page. The missing messages span a crucial window, between the presidential transition and the launch of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Strzok was removed from the probe by Mueller after he learned of the messages.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump described the missing messages as \"one of the biggest stories in a long time.\" The Department of Justice has promised to leave no stone unturned to confirm the reason for the missing texts and to recover them if possible.",
    " Title: Politifact's Assessment of Sen. Ted Cruz's Gun Prosecution Claims Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent fact-check by Politifact, Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-TX) statement regarding the decline in gun prosecutions under President Obama was labeled as \"mostly false.\" However, a closer examination of the data reveals that Cruz's statement, made on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on Nov. 8, was factually accurate.\n\nCruz stated that under President George W. Bush, prosecutions of gun crimes were 30 percent higher than they are under President Obama. Politifact criticized Cruz for cherry-picking data by comparing the year with the highest number of prosecutions under Bush (11,015 in 2004) to the 7,774 under Obama in 2012. However, if Cruz had chosen any year from 2002 to 2008, it would have shown more prosecutions than 2012.\n\nCatherine Frazier, a spokesperson for Sen. Cruz, explained that the senator's point was to highlight the need for a focus on prosecuting violent gun criminals, rather than infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nPolitifact also took issue with the source of Cruz's data, citing the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) from Syracuse University, which tracks prosecutions in which the lead charge is firearms-related. The most common prosecution, according to this data, is for a felon possessing a firearm.\n\nPolitifact preferred Justice Department figures that included gun charges in higher charges. By looking at all charges, it benefits Obama because the 2004 number (12,962) was the lowest in Bush's presidency. However, this number is still higher than the 11,728 prosecutions in 2012.\n\nThe Justice figures are irrelevant to the debate on gun control, as new laws are not aimed at reducing overall violence, but rather access to firearms. The number of prosecutions is related to the call for a federal \"universal background check,\" which would require private exchanges to go through the government.\n\nCruz co-sponsored, with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the GOP alternative amendment to the \"universal background checks\" bill pushed by Obama and some Senate Democrats. The Grassley-Cruz amendment would have focused on prosecuting existing laws on background checks instead of trying to bring more law-abiding gun owners into a broken system.\n\nThe current background check system is criticized for its ineffectiveness, with 94 percent of denials for gun purchases through the FBI's National Instant Background Checks System not being investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in 2010. Of the cases investigated by ATF field offices in 2010, only 62 charges were referred to prosecutors, and only 13 charges led to guilty pleas.\n\nIn conclusion, Sen. Cruz's statement that prosecutions for gun crimes have not been a priority for the Obama administration is supported by the statistics. The Obama administration's focus on gun control measures like the \"assault weapons ban\" and \"universal background checks\" has not been proven to reduce violence.",
    " Title: Debunking Common Misconceptions: A Closer Look at the House Freedom Caucus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the modern political landscape, the House Freedom Caucus (HFC), a group of about 40 conservative Republican lawmakers, has become a target of criticism and misinformation. This article aims to set the record straight by debunking five popular myths surrounding the HFC.\n\n1. The House Freedom Caucus Is Trying to Shut Down the Government\n\nContrary to popular belief, the HFC is not attempting to shut down the government. Instead, they advocate for a return to regular order, where Congress enacts 12 appropriations bills over the course of the year, allowing for proper debate and wise spending decisions. The HFC's goal is to avoid the governing by crisis that has become prevalent, and to prevent being blackmailed into voting for omnibus bills without proper time for review.\n\n2. The House Freedom Caucus Is Only Interested in Attacking Obama\n\nThe HFC's differences with President Obama are not personal, but rather rooted in policy disagreements. The HFC seeks negotiation, not confrontation, and has been frustrated by the president's imperious dealings with Congress. The HFC's goal is to force the president to the negotiating table and to prevent being rolled by the administration.\n\n3. The House Freedom Caucus Is Bad for the Party\n\nThe HFC is often portrayed as a disruptive force within the Republican Party. However, the HFC's vigorous debate and opposition to the status quo is a healthy sign of a functioning democracy. The HFC's goal is to ensure that the Republican Party remains true to its principles of pro-growth economics, fiscal restraint, and limited government.\n\n4. The House Freedom Caucus Is Bad for the Country\n\nThe HFC is often criticized for being a right-wing extremist group. However, the HFC's goals are in line with the Republican Party's stated principles, including combating the $18 trillion debt, economic stagnation, and government overreach. The HFC's goal is to follow through on these principles and take action, rather than simply paying lip service to them.\n\n5. The House Freedom Caucus Is a Bunch of Right-Wing Marxists\n\nThis myth is baseless and misguided. The HFC's policies are in direct opposition to those espoused by Marx, and the HFC seeks to combat economic stagnation, government debt, and entitlement system bankruptcy, among other issues. The HFC's goal is to ensure that the government remains small, that the economy grows, and that personal liberty is protected.\n\nIn conclusion, the House Freedom Caucus is a group of conservative lawmakers who are often misrepresented in the media. The HFC is not trying to shut down the government, is not solely interested in attacking the president, is not bad for the Republican Party or the country, and is not a group of right-wing Marxists. The HFC's goal is to ensure that the government operates in a fiscally responsible manner, that the economy grows, and that personal liberty is protected.",
    " Title: U.S. Judge Orders Trump Administration to Cover Costs of Reuniting Separated Families\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a U.S. judge in California has ordered the Trump administration to bear the costs of reuniting over 2,000 immigrant parents with their children who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. The judge, Dana Sabraw, stated at a hearing in San Diego that it was illogical for the parents to pay for the reunification process.\n\nThe U.S. government is currently working to reunite the children with their parents, who were detained as part of the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration. The government missed the deadline this week for reuniting the youngest of the children with their parents.\n\nJudge Sabraw, who ordered the children to be reunited with their parents by July 26, expressed concern over the idea of parents paying for their own reunification. He stated, \"It doesn't make any sense for any of the parents who have been separated to pay for anything.\"\n\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), immigrant parents have been told by immigration officials that they had to pay for their travel. One parent was initially asked to pay $1,900 to be reunited with a child, as per ACLU court papers.\n\nTrump administration lawyer Sarah Fabian called the judge's order on paying for the reunifications \"a huge ask on HHS,\" referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Fabian added that decisions regarding costs were handled at the field level, and that the department, which houses the detained children, had limited resources.\n\nThe judge also agreed to impose timelines on the government for reporting details about its reunification efforts. The administration has stated that its initial reunifications were slowed due to the need for DNA testing and criminal background checks on parents, and to determine their fitness to care for their children.\n\nIn a filing with the court, HHS official Chris Meekins stated that the administration had streamlined its vetting procedures to comply with a July 10 court order. However, Meekins also noted that the swifter process could put children at risk, as adults are no longer being DNA tested to verify parentage, and background checks are not being performed on adults who will be living with the children. Meekins expressed concern that this abbreviated vetting could result in children being placed in abusive environments or with adults who are not their parents.\n\nThe government has not yet announced its plans for the families after reunification, whether they will be released, deported, or kept together in detention. The government intends to identify between six and eight locations where all reunifications will take place.",
    " Title: Trends in Support for Free Speech Among Different Age and Education Groups in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis by John Sides, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, sheds light on the changing attitudes of Americans towards free speech, particularly in the context of controversial topics such as racism and communism. The study, published in The Washington Post, focuses on four demographic groups: young adults aged 18 to 25 with some college education, young adults with no college education, older adults with some college education, and older adults with no college education.\n\nThe most striking finding is the significant decrease in support for the right to give a racist speech among the college-age crowd over the past four decades. Contrary to popular belief, this decline did not begin in the '90s, a period often associated with the rise of political correctness. Instead, the significant drop ended in the late '80s, with a slight, but not severe, decline in the 1990s, and a resurgence in the 21st century.\n\nThis trend challenges the common narrative that views the '90s as the first age of political correctness. Sides argues that the '90s should be remembered as a time of backlash against political correctness, rather than a period of its rise. The first wave of \"PC Kids Gone Mad\" stories that hit the national press in 1990 was not a sign of pro-censorship sentiments gaining ground; it was a sign of resistance against those sentiments.\n\nThe analysis also reveals a noticeable drop in support for free speech for communists among the college crowd, although the decline is not as severe as with racist speech. The share of college-educated young adults supporting the communist's rights remains well above 50 percent. However, there is a noticeable drop at the beginning, followed by a flattening in the '90s and then a resurgence in the post-9/11 era.\n\nInterestingly, the trend among older adults with some college education did not see any decline, and those without a college education have grown steadily more tolerant. A third chart, not reproduced here but available in Sides' article, shows a similar jump in the number of non-college-educated older Americans willing to back the free-speech rights of an atheist.\n\nThe most intriguing question arising from these data is why the decline in collegiate civil libertarianism resumed after the '90s. One possible factor could be the increasing number of college-age people who do not remember the '80s. Backlashes fade with memory.",
    " Title: \"Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz Vow to Continue Campaigns Despite New York Primary Defeats, Shift Strategies Ahead of Party Conventions\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's New York primaries, both the Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz campaigns have vowed to press on towards their respective party conventions, defying suggestions from rivals that their campaigns are mathematically eliminated from the race.\n\nIndeed, after finishing third in New York, Cruz's path to overtake Donald Trump in the Republican race before the July convention appears slim. On the Democratic side, Sanders would need to win 73% of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates to catch up to Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton, who could still clinch the nomination even if she loses every remaining primary, moved swiftly to position herself as the all-but-certain nominee. \"The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight,\" she told supporters at her victory party in Manhattan on Tuesday night. A campaign aide, speaking off the record, suggested Sanders has no mathematical chance of a comeback.\n\nTrump, too, declared at his own victory party across town, \"We don't have much of a race anymore.\"\n\nCruz and Sanders, however, are recalibrating their approach and rhetoric, seemingly preparing to press on. Cruz, acknowledging he can no longer clinch the nomination before the convention, said, \"We are definitely headed to Cleveland. And in Cleveland, the people are going to prevail.\"\n\nCruz's campaign is likely to focus on the delegate-selection process to strengthen its position going into Cleveland. If Cruz, along with Ohio Governor John Kasich, can hold Trump under the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before then, Cruz aims to have delegate allies in place from across the country who would peel off from Trump and support him after the first round of voting.\n\nFurther, Cruz's campaign is courting \"unbound\" delegates in several states, most recently in Pennsylvania, which votes next week and does not bind most its delegates to the primary results, in hopes they would also flock to him in the event of a floor fight.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is aiming to secure the nomination by racking up delegates in the coming weeks, with an internal memo projecting he would get more than 1,400 delegates on the first round of balloting to secure the nomination. Right now, Trump has 845 delegates, Cruz has 559, and Kasich has 147.\n\nSanders, presuming he can't clinch the nomination himself before the Philadelphia convention, is pursuing a tricky strategy, relying on the prospect of winning over superdelegates. Clinton holds an overwhelming lead among them and is well-positioned to reach the 2,383 total delegates needed by the end of primaries in June, counting both superdelegates and pledged.\n\nSanders officials seem to be raising the bar, suggesting Clinton would need 2,383 pledged delegates to truly clinch the nomination. Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri, however, said the former secretary of state will continue to hold the pledged-delegate lead as well. After a campaign period marked by an increasingly bitter tone between the two campaigns, she accused Sanders of going down a \"destructive path\" during the New York race.\n\nIncluding superdelegates, the race stands at 1,930 for Clinton and 1,189 for Sanders. Sanders, following his New York loss, has given some mixed signals. He took a day off from the campaign trail Wednesday to return to Vermont. And senior adviser Tad Devine, calling next week a \"big week,\" said, \"We'll see how we do there and then we'll be able to sit back and assess where we are.\"\n\nSanders, however, continued to claim in fundraising memos they could still win. He told reporters after landing in Burlington, Vt., that he'd get recharged in Vermont, and thinks he can do well in the five primaries next week. He plans to return to the campaign trail in Pennsylvania on Thursday.\n\nFew in the Democratic Party expect Sanders to exit the race formally before the final contests in June. He continues to attract tens of thousands to rallies\u2014addressing more than 28,000 in Brooklyn two days before the primary\u2014and continues to raise millions of dollars, giving him fodder for a persistent fight.",
    " Title: Egypt's Former President Hosni Mubarak Granted Conditional Release from Prison\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's former President Hosni Mubarak, who ruled the nation for three decades before being ousted in the 2011 popular revolution, is set to be released from jail in the next 48 hours following a ruling by Egyptian judicial officials. The decision, which comes amidst ongoing protests and violence in Egypt, has sparked concerns of further unrest in the unraveling North African nation.\n\nThe announcement, made as Egypt grapples with new protests following the July 3 ouster of Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsi, has fueled fears of increased violent reprisals from the Muslim Brotherhood, whose supporters have clashed with security forces and torched dozens of Coptic churches. Over the past week, as many as 1,000 Egyptians, including 70 soldiers and police officers, have been killed in clashes between the Muslim Brotherhood and more secular Muslims and Christians.\n\nOn Sunday, 25 Egyptian police were ambushed and executed in the lawless Sinai Peninsula, where the Muslim Brotherhood appears to have allied with Al Qaeda fighters. Additionally, 36 Islamists died on Sunday as they were being transported to a prison outside Cairo, with government officials attributing their deaths to suffocation in the back of a prison van after tear gas was used on them during a riot. The Muslim Brotherhood accused the interior ministry of their murder, citing their opposition to the \"bloody military council.\"\n\nMubarak, who is currently on retrial for the killings of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 uprising, will be released from jail due to a two-year limit for holding an individual in custody pending a final verdict. Mubarak has been in detention since April 2011 and is currently held at Tora prison on the southern outskirts of Cairo, the same facility where senior members of the Muslim Brotherhood are being held.\n\nMubarak was initially found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in June 2012 for his failure to stop the killing of some 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising against his rule. His sentence was overturned on appeal and he is now being retried, along with his security chief and six top police commanders.\n\nEgyptian judicial authorities have ordered Mubarak's release in one of the remaining corruption cases against him, which alleged he and his two sons embezzled funds for presidential palaces. According to Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El-Deeb, the only legal grounds for Mubarak's detention rest on one other corruption case, which is expected to be resolved this week.\n\nIf Mubarak is freed, the reversal will mark a significant development, as Morsi has been held at an undisclosed location since being removed from power. The military removed President Mohamed Mursi, a senior Brotherhood official, on July 3 after mass protests against his rule. Mursi is in detention at an undisclosed location and faces an investigation into accusations, including murder, stemming from his escape from prison during the anti-Mubarak revolt.\n\nThe United States and Europe are closely monitoring the situation and urging calm as Egypt continues to unravel. The European Union plans to meet Wednesday in Brussels to discuss the situation, while President Obama, returning from vacation, has urged calm without explicitly taking sides.",
    " Title: Portfolio Manager Warns of Junk Bond Market Bubble, Exits High-Yield Exposure\n\nIn an interview, Pilar Gomez-Bravo, director of fixed income for Europe at MFS Investment Management, has expressed concerns about the current frenzy for risk in the corporate debt market, likening it to the speculative mania that preceded the last financial crisis. Gomez-Bravo, who oversees $4.5 billion in fixed-income assets, has reduced her high-yield exposure from as high as 30% in 2016 to 10%, in one of her unconstrained funds with 160 million euros (approximately $179 million), which has seen almost a 10% return over the past year.\n\nGomez-Bravo's decision to exit the high-yield market was prompted by a few weeks ago when average U.S. high-yield bond spreads fell below 375 basis points, a level that in the past has signified negative excess returns in a year's time. This threshold has also been a catalyst for other credit experts, such as Bob Michele of JPMorgan Asset Management, to become bearish.\n\nFrom her vantage point managing a slew of global credit funds, Gomez-Bravo sees the long-bemoaned opacity and leverage of junk issuers now at a tipping point. Over a third of private high-yield companies in Europe, for example, restrict access to financial data in some way, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis earlier this year. Gomez-Bravo argues that buyers should receive extra compensation for firms that curb access to earnings with password-protected sites.\n\nBorrowers still have the upper hand in the U.S. and Europe, thanks to cheap-money policies and low defaults. Speculation about the European Central Bank preparing for another round of quantitative easing is spurring the rally, masking fragile balance sheets.\n\nHowever, leaving the market too early risks leaving profits on the table. Gomez-Bravo is selling into a rising market and taking on more political risk by adding to investments in peripheral governments like Greece and Italy.\n\nGomez-Bravo, who was a portfolio manager at Lehman Brothers' investment arm during the last financial crisis, recalls the same intensity in the hunt for yield today. She warns that there are real end-of-cycle fears about what will perform.\n\nGomez-Bravo, who was a senior credit analyst on Lehman's sellside but moved in 2006 citing frustration with unchecked animal spirits, did not anticipate the violence of the downturn. Yet, she managed to avoid the blow-ups by issuing warnings on corporate health in May 2007.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Legislature Declines to Delay Presidential Primary Amid Coronavirus Pandemic, In-Person Voting to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nMILWAUKEE - Wisconsin is set to hold in-person voting next week after the state's legislature declined to take up an effort to delay the presidential primary due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The state's Republican-controlled legislature ended special weekend sessions without taking action on a call by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to make Tuesday's primary an all-mail election and extend the time to return ballots until late May, according to local media outlets.\n\nReid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Election Commission, confirmed to local media that the election will proceed as planned, with in-person voting. Leaders in the legislature, which has the sole authority to delay the ballot, criticized Evers for a late reversal on holding the voting and stated that the election, which also decides thousands of state and local offices, must go ahead as planned. Legislators could still reconsider in the coming days.\n\nRepublicans also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent the extension of Wisconsin's deadline for absentee voting to April 13, which a federal judge had previously ordered.\n\n\"Republicans in the Legislature are playing politics with public safety and ignoring the urgency of this public health crisis,\" Evers said in a statement. \"It's wrong. No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote.\"\n\nResidents in the state are under orders to stay at home and public gatherings are banned due to the pandemic. Fears about infection have led to a shortage of poll workers and an explosion in requests for absentee ballots. Officials in the state have warned of potential chaos if the voting goes ahead.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted the Democratic race to pick a challenger to run against Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, forcing more than a dozen states to delay or adjust their primaries to limit the health risks.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said it is possible to conduct Wisconsin's in-person vote safely. Rival Bernie Sanders, who trails Biden significantly in the race, called for the primary to be postponed.",
    " Title: Amazon Faces Increased Scrutiny as Nonprofit Launches Worker Safety Hotline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to address the long-standing concerns over Amazon's labor conditions, a nonprofit organization, the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, has partnered with former Amazon workers to establish a hotline for reporting unsafe working conditions within the company's warehouses.\n\nRobert B. Engel, the group's chief spokesperson, stated, \"Amazon grinds its workers until they have nothing left to give. The company has shown a blatant disregard for the safety and well-being of its workers, and it's time someone did something about it.\"\n\nThe Free and Fair Markets Initiative, which has been scrutinizing Amazon's practices since its inception last year, is particularly concerned about the company's expansion plans and its failure to address workplace conditions adequately.\n\nFor the past two years, Amazon has been on the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health's \"Dirty Dozen\" list, a designation meant to draw attention to companies that regularly put employees and communities at risk. In its most recent report, the organization noted that despite Amazon's \"vast resources,\" there is little evidence the company has made a significant effort to address worker complaints about stress, overwork, and conditions that can lead to illness, injuries, and fatalities.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Beast, emergency responders were called to Amazon warehouses at least 189 times between October 2013 and 2018 for suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental-health episodes.\n\nThe hotline, which allows workers to report unsafe conditions anonymously, also provides instructions and resources for taking their complaint further by filing with OSHA either online, physically, or over the phone.\n\nA former Hebron, Kentucky warehouse worker, who wished to remain anonymous due to a non-disclosure agreement, is helping on the hotline. They told Motherboard, \"People need to be aware of what's going on inside these warehouses. You're going to need a lot more than just one phone line to hear all these complaints from the workers.\"\n\nIn response, Amazon stated, \"We work hard to provide a safe, quality work environment for our associates, who are encouraged to provide feedback through public and private channels and are always welcome to talk to leaders at their site\u201424 hours a day, 7 days a week.\" The company also highlighted its industry-leading $15 minimum wage and comprehensive benefits starting on day one. Amazon invited anyone to compare its safety record, employer practices, and work conditions with any major employer or retailer.",
    " Title: Oregon Senate Race: Two Republican Candidates, Dr. Monica Wehby and Jason Conger, Square Off in Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming Republican primary in Oregon, two candidates, Dr. Monica Wehby and Jason Conger, are vying for the party's nomination in the bid to challenge incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley. The state, which has not elected a Republican in a statewide election since 2002, is an unlikely target for the GOP, but some believe Sen. Merkley is vulnerable due to his support for the Affordable Care Act in a state that experienced a disastrous rollout of its health care exchange, Cover Oregon.\n\nDr. Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon with 30 years of experience, is a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act. She was the first woman to graduate from UCLA's neurosurgery program and has received endorsements from GOP heavyweights like Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Dr. Ben Carson. She has also benefited from a $400,000 advertising campaign funded by the New Republican super PAC, which is attempting to pull the party more to the center.\n\nJason Conger, a two-term representative in the Oregon State House and a practicing lawyer, has a compelling personal story. He lived in trailer parks and was homeless as a child, but went on to graduate from Harvard Law School. Conger has raised less money and trails in polls, but he has support, especially from social conservatives. He is endorsed by Oregon Right to Life and former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, and he has wide support among Republican lawmakers in Oregon.\n\nDr. Wehby has been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Dr. Ben Carson. She also received a major boost in the form of a $400,000 advertising campaign funded by the New Republican super PAC. The group's ads highlight Wehby's credibility on ObamaCare, her sensitivity to issues important to women, and her own professional background.\n\nConger, on the other hand, is strong on the Second Amendment, is staunchly pro-life, and opposes gay marriage. He believes moving to the center is the wrong strategy. \"You don't have to be moderate, you don't have to abandon your principles,\" he said. \"You have to offer an alternative to voters to the incumbent, an alternative that is more attractive, that is credible, and speaks to issues that they care about.\"\n\nWehby, who was raised Catholic, says she is personally pro-life, but would not work to take away abortion rights for other women. She is divorced with four teenage children. She says she is not opposed to gay marriage.\n\nThe Republicans have been on a losing streak in Oregon ever since Merkley defeated Gordon Smith in 2002. The primary election will be held on Tuesday, and the winner will face Sen. Merkley in the general election.\n\nHowever, Wehby might carry some baggage into the general election if she wins the primary. A number of recent stories raise questions about her relationship with a Republican donor who runs a large Oregon lumber company. The Oregon Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging there was coordination between the donor and the Wehby campaign, which would have made the donation a violation of campaign finance laws. Wehby has denied any coordination. Politico is also reporting that the donor, Andrew Miller, accused Wehby of stalking him and harassing his employees as the couple was breaking up in 2013. No charges or restraining orders were ever filed.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Think Tank Proposes Comprehensive Immigration Reform, but Timing and Sequencing of Policies Remain Contentious\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from a bipartisan think tank, the New Center, has proposed a comprehensive immigration reform plan, offering a potential roadmap for addressing the long-standing issue in the United States. The think tank, a collaboration between William Galston of the Brookings Institution and Bill Kristol of The Weekly Standard, aims to bridge the political divide and find common ground on contentious issues.\n\nThe report suggests a shift towards a merit-based legal immigration system, aligning with public opinion by maintaining the overall level of legal immigration. The proposed system would prioritize factors such as education, work experience, job offers, and English skills, as opposed to the current system that admits 68 percent of immigrants based on family ties.\n\nHowever, the plan encounters resistance in its approach to illegal immigration, particularly in the sequencing of policies. The New Center's proposal offers legal status and permanent residency to individuals who have resided in the U.S. continuously since the end of 2011, have paid application fees and back taxes, and have clean criminal records. \"Dreamers\" who arrived as minors and have not committed felonies would receive green cards immediately.\n\nThe plan also includes increased border security through fencing and advanced technologies, as well as a new system for tracking people on temporary visas. Additionally, it mandates the use of E-Verify, a currently voluntary system that allows employers to check whether job applicants are in the country legally.\n\nThe crux of the controversy lies in the timing of these policies. Conservatives have long advocated for \"enforcement first,\" arguing that border control, worksite enforcement, and the deportation of overstaying visa holders should be implemented before any amnesty is granted. The New Center plan, however, does not delay amnesty and instead mandates that E-Verify not be implemented until everyone has had a chance to apply for legal status.\n\nCritics argue that this sequencing could lead to the amnesty being granted without sufficient enforcement measures being in place, as was the case with the 1986 immigration bill signed by President Reagan.\n\nThe report's authors acknowledge the difficulty in finding a compromise on this issue, suggesting that the sequencing of policies is a significant point of contention that may not be easily resolved. The success of any immigration reform plan, they argue, will likely depend on which side is able to secure enough support to push their preferred sequence through.\n\nIn conclusion, the New Center's proposal offers a thoughtful and laudable approach to immigration reform, but the sequencing of policies remains a contentious issue that could hinder the plan's implementation. The debate over \"enforcement first\" versus amnesty first is likely to continue, with each side holding firm to their position and the other side viewing any compromise as a loss.",
    " Title: Roy Moore's Senate Bid: A Look at the Challenges and Opportunities\n\nArticle:\n\nRoy Moore, the former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has announced his bid for the U.S. Senate, reviving a political career that seemed to have come to an end in 2017. Moore, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, is defying the wishes of many Republicans, including President Trump, who has stated that Moore cannot win. However, Moore still has a passionate base of support, particularly among conservative evangelical Christians.\n\nThe main question for Moore's candidacy moving forward will be whether he can attract voters beyond his base. As things stand, he could have enough backing to reach a primary runoff, as Alabama requires a nominee to win a majority of the primary vote or the top-two candidates must face off in a subsequent election. However, while Moore would probably struggle to win the majority support necessary to advance to the general election, others in the field might have weaknesses Moore could exploit.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Moore could earn support from 18 to 27 percent of the primary electorate. However, it's unclear how much Moore can raise his ceiling of potential support. Many in his own party have a negative opinion of him. In April, 29 percent of Alabama Republican voters in a Mason-Dixon poll said they had an unfavorable opinion of Moore, with 34 percent having a favorable opinion and 33 percent neutral.\n\nOne factor working in Moore's favor is a crowded primary field. A large primary field may fragment the vote, making it unlikely that a candidate could win a majority and avoiding a runoff. If Moore does finish in the top two in the primary and makes it to a runoff, he would be only one step away from a rematch with Doug Jones, the Democrat he lost to in 2017.\n\nSo far, Rep. Bradley Byrne and Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, are the major contenders. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is also gearing up to run, and State Rep. Arnold Mooney has received an endorsement from the Senate Conservatives Fund. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also a possibility for the race, as suggested by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, Alabama's senior senator.\n\nIf Moore does make it to a runoff, he would be only one step away from a rematch with Jones. National Republicans may have an \"Anyone But Moore\" attitude, and GOP groups would undoubtedly pound Moore with negative ads. However, Moore's past victory in 2017, despite Trump's endorsement of his opponent, shows that he is not impossible to beat.\n\nIn conclusion, while Moore's political career seemed to have come to an end in 2017, his recent bid for the Senate shows that he is not ready to retire from politics yet. With a passionate base of support and a crowded primary field, Moore has a path to a primary runoff, and if he makes it that far, he would be only one step away from a rematch with Doug Jones. The eventual GOP nominee stands a good chance of beating Jones in the general election, as Alabama is 27 points more Republican than the country as a whole.",
    " Title: Quadcopter Crashes on White House Grounds: Secret Service Investigates Recreational Use Incident\n\nA quadcopter, a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), was found on the White House grounds early Monday morning, according to the Secret Service. The individual operating the device reported losing control, leading to the crash.\n\nIn a statement released Monday afternoon, the Secret Service stated that an individual called to self-report the crashed copter around 9:30 a.m. ET. The person has been cooperative, and the incident appears to be a case of recreational use of the device.\n\nThe agency said an on-duty Secret Service officer saw and heard the 2-foot-wide commercial quadcopter fly low onto the grounds of the executive mansion at approximately 3:08 a.m. ET. It crashed on the southeast side, the agency said in a statement.\n\n\"There was an immediate alert and lockdown of the complex until the device was examined and cleared,\" a spokesman said, adding that an investigation is underway.\n\nEarlier, the White House stated that the device posed no threat to the first family. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are in India; their daughters, Sasha and Malia, stayed behind in Washington with their grandmother, Marian Robinson.\n\n\"There is a device that has been recovered by the Secret Service at the White House,\" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who is with Obama in New Delhi. \"The early indications are that it does not pose any sort of ongoing threat to anybody at the White House.\"\n\nDrones, as previously reported, come in a variety of sizes and are used in counterterrorism, surveillance, aerial photography, and even as toys.\n\nThis incident follows a series of security lapses at the White House for which the Secret Service has been widely criticized. Last year, the Secret Service was criticized after several lapses, including one in which a knife-wielding man scaled the White House fence and made it inside the executive mansion's main level. The incident led to the resignation of its then-director, Julia Pierson. In December, a panel appointed by the Department of Homeland Security recommended changes at the Secret Service, stating it was \"starved for leadership.\" Several top officials at the Secret Service were asked to leave earlier this month.",
    " Title: Appeals Court Upholds Order for Trump's Accountants to Release Tax Records\n\nIn a significant legal development, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, must release his personal and business tax returns to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\n\nThe ruling, which was announced on Monday, upholds a U.S. District Court order from last month requiring the release of Trump's tax returns starting from 2011. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's outside attorneys, has stated that the president will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court's decision comes as part of an investigation led by Vance into whether two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump were paid for their silence before the 2016 election. The appellate court's order does not rule on the merits of the immunity claim made by Trump's attorneys, who argue that as president, Trump is immune from criminal investigation.\n\nHowever, the court's decision emphasizes that the subpoena is directed to Trump's accountants, not the president, and compliance with the subpoena does not require the president to take any action.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating whether any New York state laws were broken when Trump's then-attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the closing weeks of the 2016 election. Trump has denied having sexual relationships with the two women.\n\nThe president is also fighting efforts by the House of Representatives to obtain his tax records. The ongoing legal battles over Trump's tax returns mark a departure from long-standing practice, as Trump, unlike other past presidents, has not divested from his business interests.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Bill to Combat Rape Kit Backlog, Providing Funding for Testing and Training\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a bill on Monday aimed at reducing the number of untested rape kits in a backlog across the United States. The legislation, known as the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019, will provide funding from the Department of Justice to help local governments clear the backlog of untested rape kits.\n\nAccording to ABC News, there are over 100,000 untested rape kits in the U.S. Currently. The White House stated that the bill, as per a statement from press secretary Stephanie Grisham, will ensure that \"criminals are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe bill will allocate $151 million to the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, $12.5 million for DNA training and education programs, and $30 million for the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Grant Program, as reported by ABC News. The bill, which was first passed in 2004, is named after a victim who was attacked in 1989, and whose evidence wasn't tested until five years later.\n\nSince 2005, the bill has led to more than 40 percent of DNA matches due to its funding, according to ABC News. Advocates argue that fighting the backlog is crucial due to the statute of limitations in some jurisdictions.\n\nThe funding for the bill traditionally has bipartisan support but got caught in the middle of the debate surrounding the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act this year, according to ABC News.",
    " Title: House Democrats Face Internal Resistance as Deadline for Funding Border Aid Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for passing the emergency aid package approaches, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is urging for its swift passage, citing its protection of families and rejection of the administration's mass detention policy. However, a significant number of House Democrats are in revolt over the bill, expressing concerns about the standards for migrant shelters and the potential use of funds for immigration enforcement.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump announced a two-week suspension of immigration raids, allowing for a bipartisan compromise on changing asylum laws and closing immigration \"loopholes.\" This sudden reversal followed a telephone conversation between Pelosi and Trump, requesting a delay in the raids.\n\nPelosi commended the postponement, and in a strongly worded statement, she called for the passage of the emergency aid package. She emphasized the moral responsibility of Congress and Americans to protect the human rights and lives of vulnerable children and families.\n\nHowever, a group of more than 30 members of the Progressive Caucus and over 15 members of the Hispanic Caucus have voiced their concerns during separate conference calls. Many argue that the legislation does not set high enough standards for migrant shelters or do enough to block funds from being used for enforcement.\n\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and co-chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus, stated, \"We all want to address the problems at the border, but we don't know that there are enough sticks in this bill to make sure that the Trump administration actually spends the money the way they're supposed to.\" Jayapal further expressed doubt in the Trump administration's adherence to any restrictions or standards included in the legislation, given its \"lawless\" behavior towards immigrants.\n\nAs the political landscape evolves, it remains to be seen whether the House Democrats can reach a consensus and pass the emergency aid package before the deadline.",
    " Title: Former Air Force Linguist Charged with Leaking Classified Documents to The Intercept\n\nA 25-year-old woman, Reality Leigh Winner, has been charged with leaking classified documents to The Intercept after allegedly stealing them from her employer, Pluribus International, a defense contractor that works for the National Security Agency (NSA). The documents, which were reportedly Top Secret, reveal that Russian agents attempted to hack into U.S. voting systems prior to the November election.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment filed in New York on Monday, Winner, a former U.S. Air Force linguist who speaks Pashto, Farsi, and Dari, stole the documents on May 9, four days after they were published by the NSA. She printed the report and sent it through ground mail to The Intercept. The news site published an article on Monday based on the stolen materials.\n\nWinner admitted to FBI agents that she stole the documents and provided them to The Intercept. The federal complaint filed against Winner reveals that she was planning a vacation to Belize last month and that she drives a light-colored Nissan Cube. Winner's social media accounts show that she visited Belize and drives a car matching that description.\n\nWinner's posts on Facebook suggest that she is politically active. On February 14, a day after Winner took her Top Secret job at Pluribus, Winner posted a photo outside of the Atlanta offices of Georgia Sen. David Perdue. She wrote that she had a 30-minute private meeting with the Republican lawmaker's state policy director, discussing her concerns regarding climate change and the state of Georgia's efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.\n\nWinner's posts also show that she was critical of President Trump, using the hashtag \"NeverMyPresident\" and \"Resist\" in a Facebook post about his position on the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Winner's most recent post was on Friday, the day before she was interviewed by the FBI.\n\nA spokeswoman for Perdue released a statement on Tuesday calling the allegations against Winner \"very serious.\" \"The allegations against Ms. Winner are very serious, and if true, directly threaten our national security. We trust our Justice Department will get to the bottom of this and handle it appropriately,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information, including about Winner's meeting in February at the offices of Georgia Sen. David Perdue.",
    " Title: House Votes to Hold Lois Lerner in Contempt of Congress: Implications and Potential Outcomes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly partisan vote, the House of Representatives has held Lois Lerner, the former head of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax-exempt division, in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions regarding the IRS's targeting of conservative groups. The vote, which occurred just three days before the second anniversary of the tea party targeting controversy, was largely along party lines, with six Democrats joining the Republican majority.\n\nThe contempt citation now moves to the Justice Department, where the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia could bring the issue to court. However, some experts expect the department to decline to prosecute, choosing instead to dismiss the case. If tried and found guilty, Lerner could face up to a year in prison or a fine of up to $100,000, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nThe contempt charge allows the House to arrest Lerner and detain her in a Capitol jail cell until she complies with the subpoena or until the end of the 113th Congress, a power not exercised since the early 20th century. However, a criminal contempt conviction would not require Lerner to testify, potentially ending any opportunity for further questioning.\n\nLerner became the face of the controversy in May 2013 when she revealed during a legal conference that the IRS had pulled conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status for additional scrutiny if they used words like \"tea party,\" \"patriot,\" and \"9/12\" in their applications.\n\nThe contempt citation does not mark the end of the IRS scandal, with numerous ongoing congressional investigations expected to conclude in the coming months. However, it may be the last opportunity for House Republicans to hear from Lerner, as a criminal contempt conviction would not necessitate her testimony.\n\nInitially, House Republicans had looked to the White House, equating the scandal to Watergate and accusing President Barack Obama of targeting political enemies. However, the lack of a smoking gun led to a toning down of the rhetoric. The Treasury inspector general for tax administration's first official report on the scandal attributed the unfair practice to gross mismanagement, not political bias.\n\nSince then, House Republicans have built a case around Lerner, accusing her of using her top IRS position for political mischief. Despite the contempt charge, Lerner's lawyer, William Taylor, has stated that \"it is unfortunate that the majority party in the House has put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights.\" Lerner has maintained that she has broken no laws.",
    " Title: Democratic Operatives Urge Donors to Support House Campaigns for Potential 2016 Synergy with Hillary Clinton's Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final weeks leading up to the midterm elections, Democratic operatives are urging donors to continue supporting House campaigns, with the hope of creating a more favorable political landscape for Hillary Clinton should she win the White House in 2016.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC have been making this argument to major donors, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a Democratic majority in the House to support Clinton's potential presidency. The National Republican Congressional Committee has also been making a parallel case, urging their own donors to maintain support and secure as many seats as possible this year to build a firewall against Clinton in 2016.\n\nJohn Podesta, senior White House counselor and expected to hold a top position in Clinton's presumptive campaign, has been meeting with donors and activists to keep their contributions coming in for the fall. The pitch is not just about holding on for 2016, but also about the potential benefits of a Democratic House in the days following Clinton's inauguration.\n\n\"So many of our donors and our activists are really, really excited about Hillary running for president,\" said Ali Lapp, who runs the House Majority PAC. \"The thing we have to say to them is, 'We are too, but let's think about all the days that follow the inauguration and what she'll be able to do with a Democratic House versus the Republican House we have now.'\"\n\nRep. Steve Israel of New York, DCCC Chairman, acknowledged the enthusiasm among Democrats for a potential Clinton candidacy, stating, \"It's safe to say that there's a lot of enthusiasm among Democrats around the country for the prospect of a Hillary Clinton candidacy, and that unquestionably factors into many donors' decision making.\"\n\nWhile the DCCC and House Majority PAC have raised significant funds, a senior Democrat noted that a strong case can be made in 2016 without Clinton, but it wouldn't be as effective. \"It's clear that she's so potent and demands the respect of the donor community around the country,\" the Democrat said.\n\nA donor who has dealt extensively with House Majority PAC described the message as \"Keep the flame alive.\" The donor explained, \"They're not going to win a majority; they still need to hold onto what seats they can and be competitive heading into a presidential year.\"",
    " Title: \"Exploring the Perspective of Race and Privilege: A Reflection on the Intersection of Whiteness and Systemic Bias\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a thought-provoking piece, the author delves into the complexities of race and privilege, using the lens of whiteness to examine the often unspoken narratives that shape societal perceptions of black individuals. The article, while not overtly political, offers a poignant critique of the insidious nature of systemic bias and the role it plays in shaping societal norms and attitudes.\n\nThe author begins by describing the metaphorical \"binoculars of privilege\" that white individuals are born with, allowing them to view black life from a distance, never truly understanding the intricacies and intimacies of the black experience. This privilege, the author argues, is not just a matter of economic status, but a deeply ingrained belief that white lives are inherently more valuable, deserving of resources and opportunities before those of black individuals.\n\nThe author then discusses the harmful narratives that are passed down informally from one white mind to another, perpetuating stereotypes about black people as lazy, dumb, slick, or immoral. These beliefs, the author notes, are not typically found in contemporary books or classrooms, but they are pervasive and damaging.\n\nThe author also touches on the resistance to learning anything different from these deeply held beliefs, suggesting that white individuals are often uninterested in understanding the hardships faced by black communities, either those self-inflicted or those endured.\n\nThe article further explores the resentment and slow-building hate that can result from this sense of entitlement and the burden of whiteness. The author suggests that this resentment is sometimes outsourced to political figures who amplify these private, detestable thoughts.\n\nThe author concludes by stating that whiteness is a form of blindness, a refusal to see or hear the experiences of those who are not white. The author suggests that this blindness leads to a cycle of fear and violence, with black individuals being held accountable for the actions of a few, while white individuals rarely take the initiative to understand the perspectives of those who are different from them.\n\nIn conclusion, this article offers a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of race and privilege, challenging readers to question their own biases and to strive for a more empathetic and understanding society.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke's Authenticity: A Key Factor in 2020 Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the crowded 2020 Democratic primary race, one quality stands out for Beto O'Rourke: authenticity. This trait, which is either inherent or not, could potentially propel him to the nominee position.\n\nWhile Donald Trump's authenticity has been a divisive factor in his presidency, it has enabled him to connect with a significant portion of the electorate. Similarly, Beto O'Rourke's authenticity could be a deciding factor in the Democratic primary race.\n\nIn a recent op-ed, the author criticized O'Rourke for his perceived lack of action during the early stages of his campaign. While other candidates such as Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and others were actively fundraising, hiring staff, and meeting voters, O'Rourke was touring the countryside, eating cobbler, and writing lengthy blog posts.\n\nHowever, O'Rourke's authenticity could be his greatest asset. He allows voters a glimpse into his personality, swearing, skateboarding, and taking far-left positions in a red state. For better or worse, he is a liberal and unapologetic about it.\n\nAuthenticity does not equate to sharing personal details such as dental visits on social media or writing blog posts that read like a high school term paper about road trips. However, if O'Rourke can strike the right balance, he has the potential to unite the Obama coalition, a feat that has eluded many in the current field.\n\nDemocrats have struggled to find a candidate who can replicate the level of support that Barack Obama garnered in 2008 and 2012. O'Rourke, with his authenticity, may have the best chance of doing so. His ability to energize minority voters, white liberals, and engage young people is a significant advantage in a field where many candidates are struggling to connect with these demographics.\n\nCompared to other candidates such as Kirsten Gillibrand and Joe Biden, who will have to address their more moderate pasts and long histories in Congress, O'Rourke's authenticity could be a significant differentiator. While Sen. Kamala Harris has faced criticism for appearing uneasy committing to policies during her early state trips, O'Rourke does not seem to have these problems. What you see is what you get, and that could take him farther than many expect.",
    " Title: Former Biden Staffer Files Criminal Complaint Against Joe Biden for Alleged Assault\n\nA former staffer for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has reportedly filed a formal criminal complaint against him with the Washington, D.C. police. Tara Reade, who previously accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993 while employed as one of his Senate staffers, told police that Biden \"assaulted her in a Senate corridor, shoving his hand under her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers,\" according to Business Insider. The statute of limitations for the alleged assault has passed.\n\nReade first spoke about her allegations last month to writer and podcast host Katie Halper, stating, \"This is a story that @ReadeAlexandra has been trying to tell since it happened in 1993. It\u2019s a story about sexual assault, retaliation, and silencing.\"\n\nIn her conversation with Halper, Reade described the alleged incident, saying, \"We were alone, and it was the strangest thing. There was no, like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall. His hands were on me and underneath my clothes. And then, he went, he went down my skirt and then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers...and um...He was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me.\"\n\nReade continued, \"He got finished doing what he was doing and I, how I was pulled back and he said, \u2018Come on man, I heard you liked me.\u2019 And that phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking what I might have said. I can\u2019t remember exactly if he said \u2018I thought\u2019 or if \u2018I heard.\u2019 It\u2019s like he implied that I had done this.\"\n\nBiden's campaign has denied the allegation. Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield issued a statement to Fox News, saying, \"Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.\" (RELATED: Alyssa Milano Says Joe Biden Deserves 'Due Process' in Sexual Assault Allegation)",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Endorses Ted Cruz in Contested Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the ongoing Republican presidential race. Bush, who suspended his own presidential bid in February following several primary losses, made the endorsement public on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe endorsement comes as a surprise given Bush's frequent criticisms of Cruz during the campaign, and the apparent ideological alignment between Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who shares similar stances on immigration and Common Core education standards with Bush.\n\nBush's brother, former President George W. Bush, has been critical of Cruz, stating last year that he doesn't \"like that guy.\" The Bush family and Cruz have not had a warm relationship.\n\nThe endorsement seems to indicate that Bush believes Cruz is the only candidate with a realistic chance of beating front-runner Donald Trump. With 739 delegates, Trump is currently leading the race, followed by Cruz with 465 delegates, and Kasich with 143, according to the Associated Press. A candidate needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright at the convention.\n\nGiven Trump's current standing, he appears to be the only candidate capable of reaching the required number of delegates. Cruz, however, is considered to have the best chance of beating Trump one-on-one and preventing Trump from reaching the threshold.\n\nBush's endorsement is the latest sign of a coalescing of the so-called Republican establishment around Cruz's campaign. If Cruz can prevent Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates (and does not himself reach that marker), the two candidates will head into a contested convention where delegates will be free to vote according to their conscience.",
    " Title: Trump Legal Team Seeks $20 Million in Damages from Stormy Daniels for Alleged Breach of Non-Disclosure Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump have filed a lawsuit seeking $20 million in damages from adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. The lawsuit alleges that Daniels breached a non-disclosure agreement signed before the 2016 elections at least 20 times.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court, comes after Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed a lawsuit earlier this month aiming to scrap the non-disclosure agreement. Avenatti described the move by the president's legal team as \"unprecedented\" and \"yet another bullying tactic\" against his client.\n\nThe non-disclosure agreement was reportedly signed in 2016, following an alleged affair between Daniels and Trump that began in 2006 and lasted several months. Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, has previously stated that he paid Daniels $130,000 of his own money to remain silent about the alleged affair. Trump \"vehemently denies\" the alleged affair.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Trump's legal team argues that Daniels' public statements about the alleged affair have caused him \"substantial and irreparable harm.\" They are seeking a change of venue from state to federal court and damages of $20 million.\n\nDaniels, in her lawsuit, claims that the 2016 agreement is invalid as Trump did not sign it. She first made claims of a sexual relationship with Trump in a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine. The story came back into the public eye earlier this year when reports emerged that Daniels was paid not to discuss the alleged affair in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nCohen has acknowledged paying Daniels $130,000 privately, but stated that neither Trump nor his company was a party to the transaction. A similar request made on Trump's behalf came from another lawyer, Charles Harder - best known for his handling of the Hulk Hogan sex tape case against Gawker and for defending Melania Trump in a suit against the Daily Mail.\n\nIn a tweet, Avenatti alleged on Friday that Daniels had been physically threatened, but did not give further details. Daniels has recorded an interview with the CBS network's 60 Minutes program to air later this month about her fight to void the agreement. A CrowdJustice campaign to raise funds for her legal fees has already raised almost $200,000.\n\nTrump has also obtained a restraining order against Daniels to try to prevent her from sharing \"confidential information\" about their alleged relationship. Daniels' legal team has expressed a view that moving the case to a federal court would help keep the case behind closed doors in arbitration.",
    " Title: Lawsuit Filed to Halt Georgia's \"Exact Match\" Voting Registration Process\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups, including the Campaign Legal Center and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, has initiated a lawsuit to prevent the state of Georgia from enforcing its \"exact match\" voter registration process. The lawsuit, filed in a federal district court on Thursday, alleges that the process violates the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe \"exact match\" system, which was used by the office of Secretary of State Brian Kemp from 2013 to 2016, places voter registrations on hold if there is a minor discrepancy between the information provided on the registration form and the state's records, such as a difference in the spelling of a name or a typo in the date of birth. The system was halted in 2017 as part of a settlement stemming from separate litigation, but the Republican-held state legislature soon passed the process into law.\n\nAccording to a recent Associated Press report, around 53,000 people, nearly 70% of whom are African-Americans, had their registrations placed in limbo due to discrepancies with their drivers' license or social security information. Secretary of State Kemp, who is currently running for governor in a closely contested race with Democratic former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, stated in a tweet, \"The 53,000 Georgians on our 'pending' list can vote in the Nov. 6th election.\"\n\nAs the AP report sparked a national outcry, the Abrams campaign called for Kemp to resign as the state's top elections official to ensure that Georgia voters have confidence in the impartiality of the Secretary of State overseeing the election.\n\nIn the lawsuit, which was initially threatened in July and is not connected to the campaign, the plaintiffs argue that the \"exact match\" checks have disproportionately and negatively impacted the ability of voting-eligible African-American, Latino, and Asian-American applicants, even before the process was signed into law by the current governor, Republican Nathan Deal, in 2017. The lawsuit seeks to block the state from enforcing the \"exact match\" process and to require the state to take steps to ensure that all eligible voters are able to register and cast their ballots.",
    " Title: \"The Syria Crisis: A Reflection of Institutional Weakness in American Politics\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Syria crisis has become a pivotal moment in modern presidential history, with President Barack Obama's handling of the situation casting a spotlight on the uncertainties and limited options in the White House. The unsteady approach to the Syria crisis has not only raised questions about Obama's leadership but also revealed the weakness of multiple institutions and leaders in American politics.\n\nThe agreement between the president and congressional leaders on a matter of national security, a rare occurrence, has been a historic event. The Syria episode has underscored the decay of party discipline, with the diminishment of the political parties being a long-term reality. The inability of these leaders to gather enough support to authorize force in Syria, particularly in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons, highlights the weakness of the American political system in a stark new light.\n\nThe lack of party discipline is evident in the Syria debate, with only six Republicans voting against George W. Bush's request for the war in Iraq, while President Obama lost two Democrats in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee alone, in addition to Ed Markey of Massachusetts voting present. The uncertain prospects for passage of the White House-backed resolution demonstrate the lack of leverage that party leaders have in pressing for passage.\n\nThe media landscape has also changed significantly, with Americans no longer congregating around a small number of outlets for their news and entertainment. A presidential speech may reach a significant portion of the public, but it will not command universal interest or attention from the American people. The power that presidents once had to make everyone stop and pay attention has waned, and Obama is acutely aware of this reality.\n\nIn his political campaigns, Obama has attempted to counteract the fracturing of the media landscape by speaking in unconventional venues. However, this approach has its limits, and moving mass opinion on a serious matter in a short period of time is challenging. The president faces a potentially public display of this media schizophrenia Tuesday with the prospect that his speech making the case for punishing Syria could take place simultaneously with coverage of Russia's efforts to broker a diplomatic end game.\n\nIn conclusion, the Syria crisis has revealed the weakness of multiple institutions and leaders in American politics, with the decay of party discipline being a long-term reality. The media landscape has also changed significantly, with Americans no longer congregating around a small number of outlets for their news and entertainment. The power that presidents once had to make everyone stop and pay attention has waned, and Obama is acutely aware of this reality. The Syria crisis has become a pivotal moment in modern presidential history, with the unsteady approach to the crisis casting a spotlight on the uncertainties and limited options in the White House.",
    " Title: Federal Government Accelerates Implementation of Same-sex Marriage Benefits Following Supreme Court Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nFour months have passed since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, paving the way for thousands of same-sex married couples to receive federal benefits. A special group of government lawyers has been working diligently to ensure the implementation of these benefits.\n\nThe task was clear: review over 1,000 rules and laws that cover various federal benefits to make sure gay and lesbian couples receive their due. This initiative was prompted by President Obama's directive hours after the high court's decision to overturn part of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder described this as a civil rights matter, comparing it to the struggle African-Americans faced in the 1950s and 1960s for equal treatment. Federal employees in same-sex marriages can now extend health and life insurance coverage to their spouses, and immigration authorities are reviewing petitions from same-sex couples in the same manner as opposite-sex couples. At the IRS, tax officials say legally married gay and lesbian couples can now file jointly.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Stuart Delery, who leads the effort to implement the Supreme Court ruling for the Justice Department, stated, \"Our job has been to make the promise of that decision, the words on the page in the Supreme Court's opinion, real for real people.\"\n\nHowever, there are still challenges. Brian Moulton, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign, noted that the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration have presented significant obstacles in extending benefits fully to married couples who reside in states that do not recognize their marriages. This situation is complicated due to the Supreme Court's decision not creating a universal right to marry, leaving the validity of same-sex marriages in states that do not recognize them unclear.\n\nAssociate Attorney General Tony West acknowledged that many of the legal issues the Justice Department has faced were relatively straightforward, but there are harder questions, such as whether the place of domicile or the place of celebration is the key factor in determining spousal benefits.\n\nAdvocates are still anxiously waiting for answers on Social Security and the VA. Ultimately, Congress may need to intervene to change the language in those laws. Even in cases where the Obama administration has spoken, there has been some pushback from states.\n\nMoulton reported that same-sex couples in five states have been forced to travel to federal facilities, sometimes long distances, to enroll in federal benefit programs for National Guard members. He expressed concern that some states seem to be politicking on this issue, particularly because these are federal benefits programs that are funded with federal money and run by the federal government.\n\nMoulton also expects more friction with Medicaid enrollment, as states administer the program jointly and could have a different view. States where gay marriage is outlawed could make it harder for same-sex couples at tax time next year, too.\n\nJustice Department officials maintain that the Supreme Court has spoken, clearly and loudly. \"The American people, I think, have assimilated this decision, are comfortable with the decision, comfortable with what we are doing,\" Holder said. \"I would hope their elected representatives could reflect the magnanimity of the American people.\"\n\nHolder concluded by stating that history is on the side of same-sex couples.",
    " Title: Analysis Reveals Hillary Clinton's Overperformance in Some States, Underperformance in Key Battlegrounds in 2016 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 Presidential Election, Donald Trump's victory was celebrated by Republicans, while Democrats attributed their loss to Hillary Clinton and her campaign. A closer examination of the election results, using Inside Elections' 'Vote Above Replacement' (VAR) metric, suggests that Clinton underperformed a typical Democrat in crucial states, while overperforming in others.\n\nThe VAR metric measures the strength of a political candidate relative to a typical candidate from the same party by comparing the percentage of the candidate's vote to the party's Baseline. The Baseline is the trimmed mean of each party's performance in partisan, contested statewide elections over the four most recent general election cycles.\n\nClinton overperformed a typical Democrat in 19 states, while Trump overperformed a typical Republican in 15 states. However, Clinton's negative VAR in the four closest states was significant enough to cost her the presidency. She underperformed in Michigan (-0.2 VAR), New Hampshire (-2.5), Pennsylvania (-3.3), and Wisconsin (-0.9). Losing three (and nearly four) of these states was a decisive factor in her defeat. Clinton also underperformed in Minnesota (-4.1) and came close to losing that state as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton overperformed in California (+6 VAR), Illinois (+3.1), and Massachusetts (+2.5). This overperformance in Democratic strongholds has led to concerns that Democrats are \"wasting\" votes by running up the score in Democratic states and not focusing on changing the Electoral College math. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report has pointed out that Trump could lose the popular vote by 5 million votes and still win re-election.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for Democrats. Clinton overperformed in the perennial battleground state of Florida (+4.2 VAR), the former battleground state of Nevada (+2.8), and the emerging battleground of Maine (+3.1). The most promising signs for Democrats might be in growing states where Clinton overperformed and Trump underperformed, such as Texas (Clinton +5.1, Trump -5.8) and Georgia (Clinton +3.1, Trump -4.3).\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of campaign strategy and the need for Democrats to focus on key battleground states in future elections.",
    " Title: Democrats Break Tradition, Counter Republican National Convention with High-Profile Visits and Speeches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from traditional political norms, the Democratic Party is set to make a significant presence felt during the upcoming Republican National Convention, with Vice President Joe Biden and other high-profile surrogates set to visit Tampa and Orlando, the host city, in an attempt to counter the Republican message and maintain a strong presence in the media.\n\nVice President Biden, who was initially scheduled to visit Tampa for the opening day, has postponed his trip due to inclement weather. However, he will be joined in Orlando by Hollywood actress and Obama for America co-chairwoman Eva Longoria, who is also expected to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, the following week.\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama has scheduled campaign stops in the battleground states of Ohio, Colorado, and Virginia on Tuesday and Wednesday. First lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to appear on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" on Wednesday, hours after GOP vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is expected to deliver his speech.\n\nThis move marks a concerted effort by the Democrats to ensure their message is not overshadowed, even during the Republican National Convention, in a race that is shaping up to be tight. Christopher Arterton, former dean of the George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management, commented, \"Decorum has broken down. It's accepted practice now. We may well see each party make news during the other's convention.\"\n\nArterton noted that Obama's status as president makes whatever he says newsworthy. \"So it's easier to intrude, particularly after a news event 'like a hurricane,' just suppose,'\" he said. Arterton also pointed out that convention week is beneficial for rival-party fundraising, as campaigns can gather donors to \"yell at the TV\" while the other convention is being broadcast.\n\nPresident Obama will hold events in Ames, Iowa, and Fort Collins, Colorado, on Tuesday, followed by a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Wednesday. In contrast, Republican presidential candidates have historically kept a low profile during their opponents' conventions, but this practice has changed in recent years.\n\nDuring the 2008 Republican National Convention, for example, Obama campaigned in Ohio and Pennsylvania while Biden courted voters in Florida and Virginia. Romney campaign officials have confirmed that their candidate is scheduled to hold events in Charlotte during the week of the Democratic convention, though details have not been released.\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki described Biden's visit to Tampa as \"going to the belly of the beast.\" Romney senior adviser Kevin Madden countered that the Biden trip is an attempt to distract from the Democrats' economic record and to draw a contrast between the parties' visions for the country.",
    " Title: Climate Change and Hurricane Harvey: A Debate on the Role of Global Warming in the Record-Breaking Storm\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, a record-breaking storm that brought catastrophic flooding to Texas, the debate on the role of climate change in the event has intensified. Climate activists and scientists have linked the storm to global warming, while others argue that the connection is tenuous at best.\n\nHurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm, marked the end of a 12-year drought since a major hurricane made landfall in the United States. The storm dropped an unprecedented 50 inches of rain in the Houston area, causing widespread flooding and destruction. In response, climate activists and scientists have pointed to the increased intensity and devastation of hurricanes as a result of climate change.\n\nEric Holthaus, a meteorologist and climate activist, declared in Politico magazine that \"Harvey is what climate change looks like.\" The Climate Reality Project, founded by former Vice President Al Gore, argued that \"climate change makes hurricanes more devastating.\" 350.org called the storm \"an unnatural disaster\" and \"the product of both a hotter planet and this administration's climate denial, racism, and callousness.\"\n\nMichael E. Mann, a Penn State professor of atmospheric science, argued that \"climate change made Hurricane Harvey more deadly.\" In a Monday op-ed, he stated, \"It's a fact: climate change made Hurricane Harvey more deadly.\"\n\nHowever, not all scientists agree with this assessment. Judith Curry, a climatologist and recently retired Georgia Tech professor, cited data showing that Harvey tied for 14th among the strongest U.S. hurricanes since 1851, based on pressure. She argued that \"anyone blaming Harvey on global warming doesn't have a leg to stand on.\"\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., a professor at the University of Colorado Center for Science & Technology Policy Research, pointed out that there were 14 U.S. landfalls of Category 4 or greater hurricanes from 1926 to 1969, but only four from 1970 to 2017. He argued that the low number of hurricanes during the Obama administration, despite rising greenhouse gas emissions, was due to \"luck.\"\n\nThe debate over the role of climate change in Hurricane Harvey has sparked criticism from some scientists and journalists, who argue that the politicized debate should be postponed during an ongoing disaster. Roger Pielke Jr. stated, \"There is no reason to be debating Harvey and climate change in the context of an unfolding disaster, other than political opportunism and attention seeking.\"\n\nAssessments by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others \"are quite clear on this subject, and one storm doesn't change that,\" Pielke said. He added, \"A better focus in the short term is on those with expertise in disaster response and recovery. The politicized debate over climate change can wait.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service reported that Harvey produced more than 50 inches of rain in Cedar Bayou, Texas, surpassing the measured single-storm rainfall record for the continental United States. However, some scientists, such as Roy W. Spencer, principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, argue that the connection between global warming and the storm's intensity is not clear-cut. Spencer disputed the assertion that rising sea levels and surface temperatures create more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to greater rainfall and flooding.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on the role of climate change in Hurricane Harvey is ongoing, with some scientists arguing that the storm was worsened by climate change, while others maintain that the connection is tenuous at best. The politicized nature of the debate has sparked criticism from some scientists and journalists, who argue that the focus should be on disaster response and recovery during an ongoing crisis. As the National Weather Service noted, \"Unprecedented\" does not necessarily mean a \"new normal,\" and the debate on the role of climate change in Hurricane Harvey will likely continue in the coming days and weeks.",
    " Title: South Carolina Governor and Major Retailers Call for Removal of Confederate Flag; Debate on Symbolism and History Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, Governor Nikki Haley has called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state Capitol. This move follows a growing wave of support from leaders across the state and the nation.\n\nOn Monday, Governor Haley, along with Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and other state leaders, held a news conference to discuss the flag's removal. Haley stated, \"Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state, without ill will, to say it is time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds.\"\n\nIn response to the call for change, major retailers such as Walmart, Amazon, Sears, and eBay have announced they will no longer sell Confederate flag merchandise. The decision comes amid an intensifying national debate over the use of the controversial flag, which has become increasingly associated with hate and racism.\n\nHowever, the issue remains contentious, with some arguing that the flag represents historical bravery, while others see it as a symbol of oppression and hate. Fox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle, during a discussion on the network's The Five, asked, \"Is the American flag next?\" This question reflects the ongoing debate about the symbolism and history attached to the Confederate flag.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly have weighed in on the issue, with Limbaugh claiming that the removal of the Confederate flag is part of a liberal agenda to \"destroy the South as a political force.\" O'Reilly, on the other hand, asserted that the flag \"represents bravery\" to some, while acknowledging that it is also seen as a symbol of hate by others.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Confederate flag continues to spark heated discussions, as some call for a reevaluation of symbols and history, while others argue for preserving historical context and tradition. The debate underscores the complex and multifaceted nature of the Confederate flag and its significance in American history and culture.",
    " Title: White House Shifts Tactics on DACA, Trump May Not Tie Border Wall Funding to Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - In a significant shift in strategy, U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly not planning to insist on including funding for a border wall with Mexico in legislation addressing protections for children brought to the United States illegally, according to a senior aide.\n\nWhite House Legislative Director Marc Short, speaking at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, stated that the administration will outline its priorities for a fix for the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile Trump remains committed to his campaign promise to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Short clarified that the decision on whether or not the border wall funding is specifically part of a DACA package or a different legislative package has not been made.\n\n\"I don't want to bind ourselves into a construct that makes reaching a conclusion on DACA impossible,\" Short said.\n\nShort's comments were seen as a signal that the Republican president is seeking to engage Democrats as well as Republicans in trying to enact his agenda. On Tuesday evening, he is scheduled to have dinner with a bipartisan group of senators whose support he hopes to win on legislation to overhaul the tax code.\n\nDemocrats welcomed Short's DACA comments, stating that they remove a major stumbling block to legislation to help DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. Democrats have insisted they will not allow border funding to be part of any legislation and would likely have the votes in the Senate to block a provision to which they objected.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat who has been working for the past 16 years to legislate protections for the Dreamers, said, \"That's an important position because we cannot make a 2,200-mile (3,540 km) wall a condition for passing the Dream Act, and we've been very clear from the start.\"\n\nDemocrats are willing to work with the White House and congressional Republicans on other border security measures as part of the legislation, Durbin added.\n\nHowever, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to limit legal and illegal immigration, criticized the potential shift on DACA, stating that the White House forfeited leverage it needs to tighten border enforcement.\n\nKrikorian said the administration seemed to be looking for an \"escape hatch\" on the controversial DACA program. \"It does suggest how much Trump wants this DACA issue to go away,\" he said.\n\nTrump announced last week that he was ending an Obama-era program that protects from the deportation of immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children, but he gave U.S. lawmakers six months to act on the issue. The move puts the onus on Congress to address the nearly 800,000 Dreamers now facing uncertainty about their status in a country that for many is the only one they have known.",
    " Title: Liberal Concerns Mount as Conservative Wave Looms: A Closer Look at Rand Paul's Role in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, a palpable tension is in the air as the conservative wave approaches, with the liberal media and the Democratic National Committee expressing concern over several top Republican candidates. This week, The Washington Post published a critical piece targeting the leading Liberty Conservative in politics, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n\nFor conservative readers who may be quick to believe negative stories, even about their own allies, it is essential to exercise caution. The escalation of such hit pieces is often a sign of the left's perceived threat level. In this case, the threat level appears to be high, with conservatives like Senator Paul effectively communicating the danger posed by big government ideologies.\n\nOne notable example of Senator Paul's influence can be seen in the Syrian conflict. Last year, when many, including President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John McCain, advocated for military intervention against the Assad regime, siding with the Free Syrian Army, some of whom later became ISIS fighters, Paul's libertarian beliefs may have prevented the U.S. from inadvertently aiding ISIS.\n\nBy advocating for caution and refraining from actions that could aid ISIS, Paul's stance saved the U.S. from potentially arming ISIS further. Fast forward to the present, and the foreign policy establishment has shifted its stance, now advocating for the destruction of ISIS. While they are late to the game, it is a positive development that they have arrived.\n\nIn the face of these attacks, it is crucial to consider the source and understand that the criticism is rooted in fear. This fear stems from the potential loss of power, with the Democrats likely to lose their majority in the Senate and crucial committee chairs in the upcoming November midterm elections, and again in 2016.\n\nAs a supporter of conservative, libertarian, and free market principles, I welcome their return to the helm of this great nation.",
    " Title: Analysis: Obama Administration's Foreign Policy Doctrine and the Iran Nuclear Deal: A Critical Assessment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's foreign policy doctrine has been a subject of intense debate, with critics arguing that the president's approach of disengagement from global affairs has left a power vacuum that has been exploited by various bad actors. The latest example of this is the Iran nuclear deal, which critics claim will empower Iran, the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThe first six months of President Obama's tenure were marked by an apology tour, during which he sought to mend fences with other nations, particularly Russia. This was followed by the infamous \"reset\" button incident, where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented a red \"reset\" button to Russian officials in an attempt to improve relations. However, this move was met with the cancellation of the U.S.'s missile defense system in Eastern Europe, a move that was seen as a betrayal of U.S. allies.\n\nThe administration's \"pivot\" to Asia in late 2011 signaled a disinterest in Europe and the Middle East, leaving these regions vulnerable. The abandonment of the Iraqi military, which was still heavily dependent on U.S. logistics and intel support, weakened Iraq's ability to defend itself, paving the way for the rise of ISIS.\n\nThe Syrian conflict, marked by President Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons against his own people, was a \"red line\" for President Obama, yet the U.S. remained on the sidelines. This lack of intervention allowed Russia, Iran, and even North Korea to exploit the U.S.'s perceived weakness.\n\nRussia, under President Putin, has since annexed Crimea and invaded mainland Ukraine, a breach of the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement that obligates the U.S. to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity. Russia has also agreed to sell its S-300 air defense system to Iran, a move that undermines U.S. interests.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, which lifts sanctions in exchange for a pause in Iran's nuclear weapons development, is a contentious issue. Critics argue that the deal offers only short-term limitations on nuclear enrichment while failing to secure unfettered \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections. They also point out that the deal will provide Iran with billions of dollars and a path to nuclear weapons in 10 to 15 years.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, is among the critics of the deal. He argues that the deal rewards Iran for its reckless behavior and support of terrorism, and that it is unconscionable for Congress to allow it to pass.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iran nuclear deal is a critical point in the Obama administration's foreign policy, and its implications are far-reaching. Critics argue that the deal will empower Iran and potentially lead to disastrous consequences for the U.S. and its allies. The deal's long-term effects remain to be seen, but the past actions of the Obama administration suggest a pattern of disengagement and a failure to protect U.S. interests.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Fail U.S. Citizenship Test, Raising Concerns Over Historical and Civic Illiteracy\n\nA new study conducted by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation has revealed a concerning trend in American historical and civic literacy. The survey, which used 20 history-specific questions from the practice tests for people taking the U.S. citizenship exam, found that a majority of Americans in every state except Vermont would fail the test.\n\nThe results of the survey are not encouraging. Only 4 out of 10 Americans would have passed the test, and just 27% of those under the age of 45. The survey was conducted between November 14, 2018, and January 3, 2019, among 41,000 adults.\n\nThe age splits on the demographic chart of how people did on the US citizenship test show a sharp decline in education over time. A flat-out majority of US citizens failed the test, including 68% of women, as well as a staggering 73% of Americans under the age of 45. Men performed better, relatively speaking, earning a 44% failure rate, while senior citizens were by far the best-informed demographic.\n\nInterestingly, there was virtually no difference between how self-identified liberals and conservatives scored on the test. The age groups also showed a concerning trend, with younger people performing poorly despite being closer to history classes.\n\nIn response to these findings, legislation moving through the Indiana Statehouse could require high school students to pass a standardized civics test by graduation. The bill, which garnered mixed reviews from stakeholders, aims to ensure that students have a strong knowledge of government.\n\nThe test from the national fellowship named after Woodrow Wilson, a former U.S. president and a controversial figure, is now available for those who wish to take it. The test serves as a reminder of the importance of historical and civic literacy in our society.\n\nIn conclusion, the survey results highlight the need for improved historical and civic education in the United States, particularly among younger generations. The Indiana legislation, if passed, could be a step in the right direction towards addressing this issue.",
    " Title: Trump and Schiff Clash Over Ukraine Call Transcript, Whistleblower Complaint\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and public statements, President Donald Trump and Representative Adam Schiff have found themselves at odds over the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a subsequent whistleblower complaint.\n\nLast Thursday, during a meeting of his committee, Schiff offered a summary of the call's transcript that Trump deemed as a \"FAKE & terrible statement\" and \"lies.\" Trump tweeted, \"Arrest for Treason?\" and claimed that Schiff's summary bore no resemblance to the actual call.\n\nOn Monday, Trump continued his criticism of Schiff, stating during a swearing-in ceremony for his new Labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, that Schiff \"made up what I said\" and \"lied\" about the call. Trump's son, Eric, also joined in the attack, calling Schiff a \"total disgrace.\"\n\nTrump also sought to cast doubt on the accuracy of the whistleblower complaint, which detailed his call with Zelensky and alleged efforts by White House officials to \"lock down\" records of the conversation. Trump tweeted that the complaint was \"mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President\" and that the whistleblower \"knew almost nothing.\"\n\nThe president later appeared to reference a report by The Federalist, which stated that the U.S. intelligence community had eliminated the first-hand knowledge requirement from its whistleblower complaint form between May 2018 and August 2019. Trump tweeted, \"WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT?\"\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, filed in early August, was deemed credible and \"urgent\" by Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general. The complaint's description of the call between Trump and Zelensky is largely similar to the readout the White House produced last Wednesday.\n\nTrump has also criticized the whistleblower, asserting that he \"deserves to meet my accuser\" and that the person who provided the information to the intelligence official may have been \"SPYING on the U.S. President.\" The identity of the whistleblower remains unknown.",
    " Title: \"Sen. Bernie Sanders Calls for Repeal of GOP Tax Law, Amidst Rising Deficit Concerns and Confirmation of Judicial Appointments\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the repeal of the Republican tax law, citing concerns over the rising budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the budget deficit will hit $1 trillion in 2020, two years earlier than anticipated. The national debt is also expected to reach $33 trillion in ten years, following its recent surge past the $21 trillion mark.\n\nDemocrats have been quick to blame the accelerated deficit and debt on the tax law passed in December. However, it's important to note that regular readers know I've expressed deep frustrations over the lack of seriousness from both political parties in addressing the looming debt crisis. While I've advocated for spending as the primary issue, the data supports this view.\n\nSen. Sanders' call for the repeal of the tax law, despite his own party's reckless single-payer healthcare scheme that would burden the federal budget with tens of trillions in unfunded and debt-bloating liabilities, seems less than credible.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are countering with online ads highlighting the day-to-day impact of their tax cuts and warning against potential tax increases under the Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is also promoting elements of the law that are benefiting'main street' operations across the country.\n\nIn other Senate news, Rick Scott has officially entered the Florida Senate race against Bill Nelson. Scott, whose job approval as governor is strong, will face a tough pickup in a challenging year. The current, razor-thin GOP upper chamber majority continues to confirm President Trump's judicial appointments at an aggressive pace. This week, Claria Horn Boom, U.S. Dist. Judge for the E. & W. Districts of KY, and Rebecca Jennings, W. Dist. KY, are among the latest confirmations.\n\nThis aggressive confirmation of judicial appointments is seen by many conservatives as a crucial element in retaining a tight Republican majority in the Senate. However, this is only possible if GOP voters remain engaged in key states.",
    " Title: \" Call to Eliminate Federal Midterm Elections: A Proposed Shift in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 In the upcoming midterm elections, approximately 90 million Americans will cast their votes, a number that, despite its magnitude, represents less than 40% of the electorate. Despite the significant financial investment\u2014over $1 billion spent on more than two million ads\u2014the midterm elections are increasingly perceived as a source of greater partisan divisions, gridlock, and ineffective governance.\n\nIn the past, midterm elections held a practical purpose, serving as a means to ensure that at least one body of Congress was accountable to the people in a new form of republican government. However, in the current political climate, with Americans' confidence in the government's ability to address pressing concerns at an all-time low, the two-year terms for House representatives no longer seem relevant.\n\nThe call to abolish federal midterm elections is gaining traction, as the two-year cycle is not only unnecessary but potentially harmful to American politics. There are few offices, at any level of government, with two-year terms. In Durham, for instance, we elect members of the school board and the county sheriff to terms that are double that length. Modern technologies, such as Twitter, ubiquitous video cameras, 24-hour cable news, and other advancements, provide a level of hyper-accountability that the framers could not have envisioned. In the modern age, we do not need an election every two years to communicate voters' desires to their elected officials.\n\nHowever, the two-year cycle's primary impact in the modern era has been to weaken the president, the only government official (other than the powerless vice president) elected by the entire nation. Since the end of World War II, the president's party has on average lost 25 seats in the House and about 4 in the Senate as a result of the midterms. This trend is bipartisan, with Democratic presidents losing an average of 31 House seats and between 4 to 5 Senate seats in midterms, while Republican presidents have lost 20 and 3 seats, respectively.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the debate surrounding their necessity and impact on American politics continues. The call to eliminate federal midterm elections is a proposal worth considering, as it may help reduce partisan divisions, increase the stability of governance, and allow elected officials to focus on addressing the pressing concerns of the American people.",
    " Title: Romney's Debate Strategy: A Game Changer or Just Another Debate?\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney approaches, both campaigns are downplaying expectations, with each side presenting their candidate as the superior debater. The debate, set to take place on Wednesday, is shaping up to be a crucial event in the 2012 election, with both candidates aiming to make a significant impact.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by The Week magazine, Romney has a 60% chance of delivering a game-changing performance. The Republican nominee is expected to focus on fact-checking the president, highlighting issues such as the high unemployment rate and the country's debt. The strategy suggests an aggressive approach, aiming to put the president on the defensive and potentially provoke a reaction.\n\nRomney's debating skills were evident during the 2012 Republican primaries, where the debates played a pivotal role. However, even if Romney delivers a standout performance, it remains uncertain whether it will translate into a significant shift in the polls.\n\nThe debate's impact is further complicated by the unique nature of this election, with culture, morals, personality, and trust playing significant roles. Romney, who has faced criticism for his background as a wealthy venture capitalist, will likely use the debate to showcase his personal side, discussing his family and father in an attempt to redefine his image.\n\nIf Romney manages to make a positive impression, it could shift public perception, much like Ronald Reagan's debate performance in 1980, which helped change the public's view of him from a raging, radical conservative to a placid, funny guy. However, the debate's impact on the election's outcome may be secondary to other factors, such as the economy and foreign policy.\n\nIn the end, Romney's success in the debate will depend on various factors, including the public's reaction, media coverage, and the candidate's ability to articulate a positive vision for the country. One piece of advice he should ignore, according to some, is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's suggestion to use humor. Given Romney's history of turning jokes into global laughingstocks, it would be wiser for him to stick to the facts.",
    " Title: US Congresswomen Protest Long-Standing Dress Code, Advocate for Modernization of House Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a group of US Congresswomen have taken a stand against the long-standing dress code in parts of the Capitol building, specifically targeting the rule that requires women to wear sleeved clothing. This is not a call to bear arms, as one might initially assume, but rather a protest against the restrictive dress code.\n\nThe movement, dubbed \"Sleeveless Friday,\" was initiated by Representative Jackie Speier who encouraged her colleagues to wear sleeveless attire on Friday. A group of around 25 women gathered on the steps of Congress, wearing sleeveless shirts and dresses, to voice their disapproval of the outdated rule.\n\nRepresentative Chellie Pingree took to Twitter, stating, \"It's 2017 and women vote, hold office, and choose their own style. Time to update House Rules to reflect the times!\"\n\nThe dress code, while long-standing, is rarely enforced, and those affected recently expressed surprise at its re-emergence. In a humorous turn of events, one reporter was seen attempting to fashion makeshift sleeves out of her notebook to comply with the rule.\n\nIt is important to note that the sleeves rule also applies to men, who are required to wear suit jackets and ties to enter the same areas. The policing of the rules is left to the chamber's security team, under the guidance of the house speaker.\n\nAfter a backlash, House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged the issue, stating in a press conference on Thursday morning, \"It came to my attention that there was an issue about dress code.\" He further emphasized that the code had not been devised under his term and agreed it needs to be modernized.\n\nThis incident echoes a similar debate that recently erupted in the UK, where House of Commons Speaker John Bercow expressed his willingness to relax the rules, accepting a question from a member of parliament who was not wearing a tie in June. The evolving nature of appropriate business attire, especially with the rise of more casual media and tech companies, is not always clear.\n\nThis development in the US Congress serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for gender equality and the need for rules and regulations to evolve with the times.",
    " Title: The Impeachment Trial and the Battle of Congressional Power vs. Executive Privilege\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump commences, the Senate faces a critical decision: whether to enforce subpoenas for witnesses and documents, or to yield to the President's assertion of executive privilege. Democratic leaders argue that the President's obstruction of Congress undermines the impeachment process, and they are pushing for the enforcement of subpoenas to ensure impartiality, independence, and a full reflection of the elected officials' conscience.\n\nThe President's actions, such as encouraging witnesses to defy subpoenas and suggesting he would assert executive privilege to block current and former administration officials from testifying, have raised concerns about an expansion of executive privilege. If the Senate subpoenas witnesses, the Trump legal team is expected to assert executive privilege or testimonial immunity to block their enforcement.\n\nThe enforcement of subpoenas during an impeachment trial is complex, and the Senate Impeachment Rules grant the Senate the power to compel witness attendance and enforce obedience to its orders. However, the sergeant-at-arms, who is responsible for enforcing subpoenas, does not have a jail or a full police force at his disposal. The last time Congress used its enforcement powers was in 1934, and the action prompted an immediate habeas petition from the recipient.\n\nThe possibility exists that the Senate will turn to the courts to help enforce subpoenas, or witnesses may defend against a Senate order to testify in federal court. This could lead to a pitched battle between Congress' power and the executive branch's claims of executive authority, potentially resulting in a Supreme Court case while Chief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the trial. If Justice Roberts were to recuse himself, the country might face the specter of a Supreme Court deadlocked on the critical question of whether a sitting president undergoing an impeachment trial has the right to assert executive privilege to block witnesses at his own trial.\n\nIn conclusion, the impeachment trial of President Trump promises to be a significant test of the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch. The outcome will have far-reaching implications for the future of impeachment proceedings and the limits of executive privilege.",
    " Title: New York's World Trade Center Health Program Expands to Include Certain Cancers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the World Trade Center Health Program, a federal program established in 2010 to provide medical care and compensation to those affected by the September 11 attacks, has expanded its list of covered illnesses to include certain cancers. The decision, made by Dr. John Howard, the program's administrator, recognizes the health concerns of those who worked, lived, or attended school in Lower Manhattan between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002.\n\nOne individual who typifies the complexities of this decision is Ernest K. Matthews, a 62-year-old cancer patient who developed lung cancer in 2008. Mr. Matthews, a member of a crew that cleaned elevators for the Merrill Lynch building near ground zero, was diagnosed after part of his right lung was removed. He claims he had no breathing problems before the attacks but developed them soon after.\n\n\"It's a good day,\" Mr. Matthews said on Friday. \"Look at all the people that suffered and lost their lives, sacrificing for the cleanup. It took so long for them to decide to help the people that were suffering.\"\n\nDr. Howard's decision represents a shift from initial assurances by the federal government following the terrorist attacks that the air was safe. In July 2011, Dr. Howard himself stated there was insufficient evidence to link cancer to September 11. However, in a detailed report explaining his decision, Dr. Howard cited a New York Fire Department study published last fall in The Lancet, which showed a 20% higher rate of cancer among firefighters exposed to ground zero toxic substances compared to those not exposed, as a strong foundation for the conclusion that some cancers were caused by exposure to World Trade Center debris.\n\nBeyond the Lancet study, Dr. Howard relied on recommendations from a scientific and technical advisory committee consisting of experts in cancer, environmental medicine, toxicology, and epidemiology, as well as neighborhood activists and union officials. The committee recommended that 14 broad categories of cancer, encompassing 50 specific types, should be deemed as related to the attacks.\n\nAmong the cancers Dr. Howard approved are common types like lung, breast, colon, trachea, esophageal, kidney, bladder, skin, thyroid, blood, ovarian cancers, and childhood cancers, which are relatively rare but more susceptible to toxic substances.\n\nIndividuals with covered cancers who meet the specified criteria will be able to apply for compensation for their economic losses, pain, and suffering. Survivors of patients who have died, as well as people caught in the dust cloud downtown on the day of the attack, may also apply. The amount of compensation will depend on the severity of the illness and duration of exposure, as proven by records like employment or housing documents, or city personnel records for fire, police, and other public workers.\n\nThe new rules will also apply to Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa., responders, and it allows those cancer patients to tap into a treatment fund to pay for medical costs not covered by insurance.\n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has consistently deferred to scientific rulings on health hazards at ground zero, said that his administration had called for periodic reviews of the medical evidence on cancer, and that the decision was \"an important step.\"\n\nThe advisory committee considered but rejected, by a 14-to-3 vote, the notion of adding all cancers to the list. It explicitly rejected pancreas, brain, and prostate cancers, for various reasons. The committee could meet again to discuss other potential additions to the list.\n\nThe broad sweep of the committee's recommendation raised some eyebrows among epidemiologists, several of whom have said that it appeared the committee was appealing to societal concerns that the cancer patients not be left out of the fund.\n\n\"Clearly this was a difficult decision, and primarily motivated by concern for a sympathetic population,\" said Dr. Alfred I. Neugut, an oncologist and professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia. \"The scientific evidence currently is certainly weak; whether future evidence bears out the wisdom of this decision will have to be seen.\"\n\nDr. Howard made a nod toward a concern of some epidemiologists that because cancer was a common disease, it would be hard to distinguish who got cancer because of September 11 from those who did not. He also said that hard scientific data conclusively linking September 11 to cancer might take years to obtain.\n\n\"Requiring evidence of positive associations from studies of 9/11-exposed populations exclusively does not serve the best interests\" of the patients, he wrote.",
    " Title: Michigan Primary: Cruz, Kasich Vie for Second Place as Trump Alternative; Sanders Faces Pressure to Win\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming Michigan primary, the Republican race for second place is heating up as Ted Cruz and John Kasich vie for position, each aiming to present themselves as the strongest alternative to Donald Trump. The primary, taking place in a traditionally blue state, could potentially alleviate concerns about Cruz's ability to compete in Democratic-leaning states, while a strong performance by Kasich could set the stage for a significant showing in his home state next week.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders, who is known for his economic message, faces pressure to win Michigan, a state that has been affected by outsourcing and should be receptive to his platform. However, the state is whiter than the nation as a whole, and black voters, who have been a significant factor in Clinton's Southern victories, make up roughly the same share of the electorate in Michigan as they do nationally.\n\nFor Sanders, the burden is particularly high, as he seeks to make up for losses in the early part of the primary season with stronger performances moving forward. The polls currently suggest a decisive victory for Hillary Clinton, making a surprise win for Sanders necessary to demonstrate his continued viability in the race.",
    " Title: President Trump's Campaign Launches $10 Million Advertising Blitz Ahead of Midterms, Bolstering GOP Efforts to Maintain Congressional Control\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to bolster Republican candidates and maintain control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections, President Donald Trump's campaign is planning an advertising blitz worth $10 million, according to exclusive information obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The campaign's commitment includes a $6 million TV and digital ad buy set to launch on October 29 and run through Election Day, with an additional $3 million being sent to the Republican National Committee (RNC) to support GOP campaigns.\n\nThe president's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, stated, \"President Trump is all-in for the midterms to lead the GOP to victory on Election Day. His winning spirit is energizing Americans across the country to get out the vote and keep the momentum of our America First agenda going strong.\"\n\nThe nearly $10 million commitment is part of more than $20 million the president's campaign is spending on the midterm elections, including rally costs. The campaign's efforts also include holding multiple \"Make America Great Again\" rallies, with at least 10 more scheduled before the election. Since the summer, Trump has held 20 such rallies.\n\nAccording to the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll, in competitive districts, Democrats and Republicans are in a dead heat on the question of which party should control Congress. The Washington Post survey released Tuesday reported that Democrats hold a \"statistically insignificant lead\" in battleground districts.\n\nThe RNC has also seen significant fundraising success, announcing a record $269.9 million raised in a non-presidential election year, with $56.8 million raised in the third quarter. The RNC told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that 40% of the total were small-dollar donations. The Democratic National Committee has raised $136 million so far this cycle, including $9.6 million in September, compared with the RNC's $26.2 million in the same period.\n\nDespite the RNC's fundraising edge, Democratic candidates have benefited from a windfall of individual donations, fueled in part by the fundraising tool \"ActBlue,\" which has sent over $1 billion in donations to Democrats this cycle.\n\nBoth parties are taking an equally urgent tone in appealing to voters not to sit out the election. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez tweeted, \"This is the most important election of our lifetime.\"\n\nAside from rallies, the next big commitment will come in the form of the ad buy set to launch on October 29. Lara Trump, a campaign senior adviser and daughter-in-law to the president, said, \"With so much at stake in the midterms, we\u2019re leaving everything on the field to build our incredible progress for the American people.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Senators Allege Political Targeting of Planned Parenthood Affiliates Over PPP Loans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza, a group of Democratic senators, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have accused the Trump administration of unfairly targeting Planned Parenthood affiliates by pressuring them to return federally-funded Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.\n\nThe senators argue that the SBA's move to reclaim the PPP funds is an \"ideologically-driven action\" aimed at \"scoring political points for this administration by attacking nonprofit health care providers.\" They contend that Planned Parenthood is being arbitrarily singled out among over 4.3 million loans issued under the program.\n\nThe SBA has reportedly notified at least three Planned Parenthood affiliates to return their PPP loans, but it's unclear if other clinics have been contacted. The SBA and the Treasury Department have declined to comment on individual borrowers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood maintains that their affiliates rightfully qualified for the PPP funding. Jacqueline Ayers, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president of government relations and public policy, stated that \"like many other local nonprofits and health care providers, some independent Planned Parenthood 501 (c) (3) organizations applied for and were awarded loans under the eligibility rules established by the CARES Act and the Small Business Administration (SBA).\"\n\nThe eligibility rules, outlined by the SBA, allow for most businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 workers to qualify for PPP. However, Republicans have argued that since Planned Parenthood Federation of America has organizational control over its affiliates, it should be considered as one large enterprise with too many employees to qualify for the lending program.\n\nIn their own letter last week, Senate Republicans urged the Department of Justice to open an investigation into reports that Planned Parenthood affiliates received roughly $80 million from the program. Planned Parenthood, however, argues that because the individual affiliates that received PPP loans have their own governing boards, they must be considered as smaller, standalone entities that lawfully qualify for the program.\n\nThe SBA's rules for determining eligibility for the PPP have been a source of confusion since their implementation. In their letter, Democrats claim the intention of the program has always been clear, stating, \"The decision to fund PPP was based on a mutual and bipartisan consensus that it was important for this program to assist the broad universe of nonprofit organizations in this country, many of whom provide food assistance, health care services, child care, charitable services, and other essential functions that constitute a critical component of our social safety net.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Louie Gohmert Advocates for Second Amendment Rights in Fox News Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated discussion on Fox News Sunday, Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) argued for the importance of the Second Amendment in the wake of the Connecticut massacre, countering calls for more gun control from some political figures.\n\nDuring the segment, Gohmert responded to Attorney General Eric Holder's call for a national conversation about gun control by bringing up the Fast and Furious scandal, in which guns sold by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives were illegally trafficked to Mexican drug cartels, leading to the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and hundreds of others.\n\nWhen asked about the Aurora movie theater massacre and Gohmert's argument for more people to carry weapons to prevent similar incidents, Gohmert stated that every mass shooting in recent history has occurred in a gun-free zone, except for one. He argued that allowing concealed carry could have prevented tragedies like the shooting in Connecticut, citing the defensive wounds on the victims and the heroic actions of the school principal who tried to protect the children.\n\nGohmert also addressed the question of why the average person needs semi-automatic weapons, stating that they are necessary to ensure the American people remain armed and able to resist government tyranny, as George Washington had suggested. He argued that drawing the line on gun ownership would lead to a slippery slope and that allowing concealed carry has been shown to reduce crime rates.\n\nThe interview concluded with Gohmert emphasizing the importance of having an open and fact-based dialogue about gun rights, rather than reacting emotionally and calling for the outright elimination of guns.",

During an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie that aired Thursday on \"Today,\" Pelosi suggested that the Department of Justice guidelines, which suggest a sitting president cannot be indicted, may not be conclusive.\n\nPelosi, who is expected to be sworn in as Speaker of the House on Thursday, was asked about the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. When asked directly if Mueller could indict a sitting president, Pelosi responded, \"Let's just see what Mueller does. Let's spend our time on getting results for the American people.\"\n\nMueller's team is currently investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. Mueller has indicted multiple high-ranking Trump campaign officials on crimes seemingly unrelated to Russian interference, and he is expected to release a report to Congress detailing his findings as soon as mid-February.\n\nThe relevant Justice Department guidance, drafted in 2000 by the office of legal counsel, states, \"The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\"\n\nIn making the case that the guidance in question might be ignored, Pelosi pointed out that there is no existing legislation prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president. \"It's not the law,\" Pelosi told Guthrie. \"Everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president of the United States.\"\n\nWhen asked if a president who is in office could be indicted, Pelosi responded, \"I think that is an open discussion.

The meeting, set to take place in the Capitol basement, will see lawmakers return from a week in their districts, where they have been hearing constituents' reactions to the Senate-passed bill.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner and his leadership team are aware of the political pressure that will build but view immigration as not time-sensitive. They are comfortable with letting the process stretch until the end of the year.\n\nKey lawmakers have been meeting with groups of rank-and-file Republicans, but have had a difficult time reading the \"coalitions\" - the pockets of opposition and support for the myriad proposals. Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a member of leadership, expressed uncertainty about what could garner enough Republican support for a floor vote.\n\nThe leadership's strategy is coming into clearer focus. The meeting will be broken down into a three-step process. GOP leadership, likely a combination of Boehner, Eric Cantor (R-Va.), and Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), is expected to give a short presentation, urging lawmakers to speak their minds so the party can develop a policy.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) will explain what House committees have already passed and options going forward. The leadership needs to find out where people stand on four main areas: the future flow of immigrants into the U.S., a possible pathway to citizenship, government benefits, and border security.\n\nThe House may take up the Senate bill in committee, strip it down to the studs, and rewrite it.

The meeting, which was largely a social gathering, took place in the White House dining room, where grilled chicken, pasta jambalaya, and salad were served.\n\nThe lunch was an opportunity for the two leaders, who had a strong working relationship during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, to catch up. Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated, \"Much has been written about over the last four years how Secretary Clinton and the president have developed not just a strong working relationship, but also a genuine friendship.\"\n\nClinton's meeting with Obama was not the only White House visit of the day. On Tuesday, she is scheduled to meet with Vice President Joe Biden at the Naval Observatory. The meeting, which was \"long scheduled,\" according to a White House official, is expected to take place as planned.\n\nCurrent Secretary of State John Kerry was also spotted at the White House around the same time as Clinton, but it appears he did not join the lunchtime meeting. Clinton, however, did stop by to say hello while Kerry met with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to Clinton aides.\n\nThe White House is preparing for Middle East peace negotiations in Washington on Monday night, and it is possible that the talks came up during the meal. Earnest indicated that the purpose of the lunch was primarily social, but given the close working relationship between Obama and Clinton during her time at the State Department, it would not be surprising if the talks were discussed.\n\nClinton and Obama's meeting on Monday came about after they saw each other at the George W.

In a series of unexpected and at times uncomfortable moments, Biden attempted to showcase his support and allyship.\n\nThe former vice president flirted with multiple men, joked about coming out as gay, and mimed kissing Anderson Cooper, the gay CNN anchor moderating his portion of the town hall. These actions, while unexpected, were not limited to Biden; Kamala Harris also caused a stir when she stated her pronouns as she/her/hers, to which CNN's Chris Cuomo responded, \"Mine, too.\"\n\nBiden's actions were met with a mix of amusement and discomfort among viewers. His attempts to prove his acceptance and comfort with the LGBTQ community were criticized as inappropriate and tone-deaf by some, while others saw them as a genuine effort to connect with the community.\n\nDespite the controversy, Biden ended his time on a note of acceptance, affirming that being queer in 2019 is normal and normalized. He also highlighted the progress made in public discourse around LGBTQ issues, noting the shift from discussions about gay bathhouses and round-the-clock sex to the stability of gay relationships.\n\nThe town hall provided a platform for a fruitful discussion about the future of LGBTQ lives in America, but Biden's unconventional approach to demonstrating his support was a topic of conversation throughout the event.

    " Title: Mortgage Industry Braces for Potential Crisis Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put the mortgage industry on high alert, with estimates suggesting that between 25 and 50 percent of borrowers may struggle to make their mortgage payments. This widespread inability to pay could potentially threaten the viability of mortgage servicers, particularly nonbank servicers, according to a letter from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nMargaret Liu, CSBS senior vice president and deputy general counsel, stated that state regulators intervened because \"our members are the primary regulators of the nonbank servicers.\" If 25 percent of borrowers fail to make their mortgage payments, the industry would require approximately $40 billion to cover three months of payments, according to Jay Bray, CEO of servicing company Mr. Cooper. This figure could escalate to $75 billion, and potentially surpass $100 billion, depending on the duration of the crisis, as per estimates by industry expert Broeksmit.\n\nAndrew Jakabovics, vice president for policy development at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing nonprofit, warned that a widespread failure of mortgage companies could lead to a systemic breakdown. He explained that the relief measures implemented during the 2008 financial crisis were crucial to maintain the U.S. mortgage-backed securities as a safe investment, and a similar situation could have \"very serious ramifications for the availability and price of mortgage credit.\"\n\nHowever, industry experts believe that the Federal Reserve will step in with an emergency lending program to support the industry. Michael Bright, who previously managed the $2 trillion portfolio of government-run mortgage financier Ginnie Mae, expressed optimism that the Fed's Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility Program could be extended to include mortgage industry support.\n\nMark Calabria, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage giants that underpin about half of the nation's $11 trillion market, expressed confidence that large banks would continue to extend credit to mortgage servicers for the time being. However, he cautioned that if the crisis persists beyond two months, a more comprehensive solution would be necessary.\n\nBroeksmit noted that some mortgage companies may not survive if they have a high concentration of loans in areas heavily impacted by the virus. He emphasized the need for the emergency lending facility to be established promptly to address the liquidity needs of mortgage servicers.\n\nLiu also highlighted that the credit lines from banks would not be sufficient to sustain the mortgage market during a crisis. She underscored the importance of the government as a reliable and available source of credit for the mortgage market and mortgage servicers during a crisis.\n\nIn the interim, the industry is hopeful that individual cash relief in the Senate bill will minimize the number of people seeking forbearance on their mortgage payments. Broeksmit stated, \"We're hoping that the take-up rate won't be too high and that the duration is not extended, but we have to prepare for both.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Advance Legal Action for Unredacted Mueller Report, Intensifying Congress-Trump Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. congressional Democrats have moved a step closer to suing for access to the unredacted Mueller report on Russian election meddling and its underlying evidence, escalating their ongoing conflict with President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a move bound to intensify the clash between the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Trump administration, Democrats have unveiled a resolution that authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to seek a court order to enforce subpoenas against U.S. Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.\n\nBoth Barr and McGahn have refused to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee, which seeks the unredacted report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his probe into Russian election meddling and possible obstruction of the probe by Trump, as well as documents related to the investigation and testimony from McGahn, a major player in the Mueller inquiry.\n\nThe resolution, which the House is expected to consider on Tuesday, replaces an earlier plan by House lawmakers to vote formally on whether to hold Barr and McGahn in contempt of Congress.\n\nIntroduced by the House Rules Committee, the measure also sets out terms for possible court action by other House committees that are investigating the president and authorizes the Judiciary Committee to petition a federal judge for access to Mueller\u2019s grand jury evidence.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is similarly poised to file a federal lawsuit to enforce subpoenas of Trump\u2019s individual and business tax returns.\n\nCongressional committees already have the authority to seek court remedies. But Democratic aides said Tuesday\u2019s vote is intended to reaffirm congressional authority to enforce subpoenas against White House efforts to stymie investigations by six separate House committees.\n\n\"We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,\" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, who will take up the measure on Monday, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Trump administration is waging an unprecedented campaign of stonewalling and obstruction... This resolution will allow Congress to hold the president accountable,\" McGovern added.\n\nJustice Department officials were not immediately available to comment on the resolution.\n\nThe measure follows through on House Democrats\u2019 plans to go to court in their quest for an unredacted copy of Mueller\u2019s report. Democrats say they are confident of swift court victories after decisive court rulings against Trump\u2019s efforts to block subpoenas of his financial records issued by three other House panels.\n\nBarr released a redacted version of the 448-page report on April 18. He later disregarded a House Judiciary Committee subpoena demanding release of the full report, along with the underlying evidence that Mueller relied on.\n\nThe House Judiciary panel voted on May 8 to cite Barr for contempt of Congress. The House Oversight Committee is also weighing contempt citations against Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for failing to comply with subpoenas in its probe of their handling of the U.S. Census.\n\nIn a letter to Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings on Thursday, the Justice Department called a contempt vote \"entirely premature\" and declined to hand over the specific documents demanded, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege and other doctrines. It said it was still working to produce other papers the committee requested.\n\nThe White House has asserted the seldom-used principle of executive privilege to try to keep the full Mueller report under wraps, even though Trump allowed aides to speak with Mueller during his investigation.\n\nHouse Judiciary also subpoenaed McGahn, seeking his testimony, which he refused to provide in line with a pattern of stonewalling by Trump of Democrats\u2019 inquiries.\n\nLawmakers have said they would vote to hold Barr and McGahn in contempt. But on Thursday, aides said a formal contempt vote would have referred the case for criminal prosecution, a move unlikely to succeed with Barr at the helm of the Justice Department. Lawmakers instead opted for the new resolution.",
    " Title: White House Kicks Off Three-Week \"Made in America\" Campaign to Highlight President Trump's Agenda\n\nThe White House is embarking on a three-week \"Made in America\" messaging campaign starting Monday, with a focus on key aspects of President Donald Trump's policy agenda. The campaign, which will span over three weeks, is expected to serve as a prelude to the Senate's push to rewrite the U.S. tax code.\n\nThe first week will emphasize American-made products, followed by \"American Heroes week,\" focusing on American jobs, and concluding with the \"American Dream\" week. The White House has opted not to dedicate a week to healthcare, despite the ongoing efforts to pass a Republican alternative to ObamaCare through the Senate this month.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump will showcase locally produced goods from all 50 states, touring products displayed at the White House and on the South Lawn. He will also address the media on his administration's support for manufacturing companies in America.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Wall Street Journal that the campaign aims to underscore the president's emphasis on tax code reform. The campaign follows the White House's initiative to promote \"theme weeks\" on policy areas, such as \"infrastructure week\" in early June, during which the president frequently tweeted about infrastructure issues. Subsequent theme weeks focused on energy and technology.\n\nThe campaign's launch comes as White House aides reportedly grapple with determining which of the president's policy priorities to prioritize. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a political adviser to Trump, told the Journal that the White House communications team is still learning how to leverage its political influence, and that the team was unclear in stating its goals for the healthcare debate.",
    " Title: June Jobs Report Shows Sluggish Growth, Impacting Presidential Race Amidst Swing State Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 80,000 jobs in June, according to figures released by the Labor Department on Friday, marking a slight increase of 3,000 jobs compared to May. The 8.2% unemployment rate is lower than it has been in the last three Junes, but the slow job growth has raised concerns for the incumbent President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a swing state like Ohio, where the unemployment rate was 7.3% in May, the question of the economy's future direction is of particular importance. The slow job growth does not bode well for Obama, as political experts argue that what matters more than month-to-month jobs numbers is a candidate who offers a better long-term plan for economic recovery.\n\nFrankly, I think no matter who had been president, the last four years would have seen very sluggish recovery. It's normal after a financial crisis, but there is a question of where things are going from here, said Ken Rogoff, an economics and public policy professor at Harvard University and former International Monetary Fund chief economist.\n\n\"What are the job numbers going to look like the next four years? And I think that's what the debate has to be around. There are, of course, two very different visions for the economy between candidate Romney and President Obama, between growth and perhaps more fairness,\" Rogoff told Soledad O'Brien on CNN's \"Starting Point\" on Friday.\n\nIn Ohio, the president spoke with diners who worked at Goodyear Tire & Rubber and toured the Summer Garden Food Manufacturing plant, which makes pasta sauce, in Boardman, Ohio, before the flat job-growth numbers were released. Later, the president addressed the tepid job growth in a speech to a gathering of a few hundred at an elementary school gym in Poland, Ohio.\n\nObama highlighted the economy's slow but steady recovery under his watch, such as businesses creating \"4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months, including 500,000 new manufacturing jobs,\" and a government program to shore up the ailing U.S. auto industry. Obama also acknowledged that \"It is still tough out there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, across the country in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, Republican challenger Mitt Romney called the jobs figures \"another kick in the gut to middle-class families.\"\n\n\"The president's policies have not gotten America working again, and the president is going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it,\" he said.\n\nRomney's economic recovery plan includes reducing the corporate income tax rate and curbing some of the regulatory policies he says have driven up energy costs, among other measures to help whittle down the unemployment rate.\n\nRogoff says there are things that can boost the economy, such as nixing many tax exemptions, rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, and improving the education system.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we can do. The U.S. is a fantastic franchise, but this political paralysis that we've had between the Congress and president that's been going on for a long time has been leaving the economy drifting in the wind,\" he told O'Brien.\n\nThe June jobs figures may make news now, but presidential candidates and voters will be more closely watching a critical jobs report due just days before the November 6 general election, said Tom Smith, an assistant professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. If there's an uptick in jobs creation just before the election, Obama is in good stead. But a downtick could bode well for Romney, Smith said.\n\n\"There are two things that are going to impact this election: the unemployment rate and jobs creation... People are looking for things to get better,\" Smith said. \"People don't have the money to eat.\"",
    " Title: Social Media Buzz Surrounds Light-Hearted Moments During State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nAs US President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address to Congress, the event sparked a flurry of activity on social media, with political analysis and partisan debate taking a backseat to a number of more light-hearted talking points.\n\nOne of the most popular memes of the night centered around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile opponent of the president who sat behind him during the address. A photo of Pelosi applauding after Trump called for compromise in politics became a subject of discussion, following the president's decision to break traditional protocol by not waiting for the customary introduction from the House speaker before beginning his speech.\n\nAnother notable moment came when women on both sides of the house made a powerful political statement by wearing white to celebrate the centenary of women's right to vote in the US. The move highlighted the significant number of female Democrats compared to Republicans. The female representatives sat stony-faced as President Trump said \"no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women.\"\n\nAfter the president said that women \"filled 58% of the newly created jobs last year,\" they started enthusiastically cheering and clapping each other. Many of the Democratic lawmakers cheering took office after the recent mid-term elections, which saw a record number of women elected and the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe irony of this was not lost on many Twitter users. While many suggested that Mr. Trump did not intend for his comments on female employment to be associated with the electoral success of Democratic congresswomen, the president did go on to praise the influx of female lawmakers.\n\nAnother light-hearted moment came when President Trump and First Lady Melania invited 11-year-old Joshua Trump from Wilmington, Delaware, who has been bullied at school because of his surname. Photos appearing to show the boy, who is not related to President Trump, dozing off during the speech earned him some fans on Twitter. His parents pulled him out of school as they said his classmates had called him an \"idiot\" and \"stupid\" for sharing the same name as the president. Eline, the girl sitting next to him, has been treated for brain cancer. She seemed to enjoy the evening a lot more.\n\nThe State of the Union is an opportunity for the president to inform the nation of his goals for the year ahead. However, some were distracted by less weighty issues, such as the position of the president's tie. Many took to social media to point out that the president's trademark red tie was off-centre.\n\nDuring the almost 90-minute address, many social media users seemed preoccupied by trying to guess what Nancy Pelosi was reading. Some took to Twitter to suggest that Ms. Pelosi was being \"disrespectful\" by reading while the president spoke.\n\nAfter President Trump finished his address, Stacey Abrams delivered the Democratic response. While the Georgia politician spoke about immigration, voting rights, healthcare, and the economy, Twitter-users homed in on the way the address looked. Ms. Abrams could be seen standing at a lectern in front of a group of people blurred out behind her. Many wondered if she was appearing in front of a green screen. However, as can be seen below, after Ms. Abrams finished speaking and the camera zoomed out, it is clear that a green screen was not used.",
    " Title: Democrats Brace for Potential Losses in Seven Key Senate Races Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2014 midterm elections approach, Democrats are facing a challenging landscape in their bid to retain control of the U.S. Senate. With three seats vacated by retiring Democrats, the party is bracing for potential losses in seven key races.\n\nFour weeks before the elections, even some Democratic operatives struggle to envision a scenario where they retain control of the Senate. The terrain and current momentum seem to be working against them.\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday morning suggests a Republican lead over a Democratic incumbent in Alaska, adding to Democrats' concerns. A Democratic consultant, speaking anonymously, admitted, \"If you put a gun to my head, I guess I'd say that we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nPresident Obama is not solely to blame for the Democrats' predicament, though he is a factor. A Democratic operative said, \"I love the guy and I don't think there's anything he could do to fix it, but he's a real drag.\" The operative added, \"The bigger drag is the economy overall\u2014even though the economy is getting better, people aren't feeling it because wages are stagnant.\"\n\nAnother issue is that many of the Democrats defending their seats in GOP-leaning states had a fresh, new Obama in 2008 helping to sweep them into office. The class of 2008, often referred to as Obama babies, are now facing the consequences of that wave.\n\nIn Alaska, for instance, Sen. Mark Begich, who won against then-Sen. Ted Stevens in 2008 with 47.9% of the vote, is currently polling in the low 40s. He trails his GOP opponent, Dan Sullivan, by six percentage points among likely voters in the CNN/ORC poll released Thursday.\n\nThe basic math, for those not as fixated as the rest of us, is as follows: The GOP needs to win at least six seats (though the number may end up being seven given the peculiarities in Kansas\u2014more on that later). Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota\u2014where three incumbent Democrats have said farewell\u2014are considered easy GOP pickups, with GOP candidates ahead in polls by double digits.\n\nThis leaves seven competitive Senate races where Democrats are playing defense: solid red states Alaska, Arkansas, and Louisiana; and blue-ish Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, and purple-ish North Carolina. Democrats are feeling cautiously optimistic about exactly two of these races, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, and Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC.\n\nHagan is instructive in this way. She currently polls at 44% against her GOP opponent Thom Tillis, with 40%. As Obama squeaked in a 49.9%-49.5% victory against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for North Carolina in 2008, Hagan defeated then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-NC, 52.7% to 44.2%. North Carolina elected a Democratic governor and handed Democrats victories in eight out of 13 House races in 2008.\n\nFour years later, North Carolinians opted for Mitt Romney, a GOP governor, and Democrats were down to four out of 13 U.S. House seats. Hagan could certainly pull out a win this November, but it won't be because she's riding a wave\u2014it will be because she successfully fought against it.\n\nEach race is its own individual microcosm, incumbents have advantages challengers do not, four weeks is a lifetime in politics, Dewey Defeats Truman, insert clich\u00e9 here. The Senate GOP Leader, Mitch McConnell, has a competitive race in Kentucky, though I know few Democrats who think he won't eke it out at the end of the day. And Kansas is a peculiar one, with the Democratic candidate having withdrawn, and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts facing an independent challenger who has not said with which party he'll caucus. Democrats are hoping if the final vote comes down to Independent Greg Orman, he'll remember that Democrats cleared the field for him. A CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday showed the race in a virtual tie with Roberts just one percentage point ahead.\n\nThe Democratic operative noted that his party was benefiting from some GOP struggles, namely the Republican party's inability to raise as much money as it had wanted to, infighting among GOP Super-PACs, and general infighting among conservatives. \"But midterm elections are generally more difficult for the party that holds the White House,\" the Democratic consultant said, adding that opposition to Washington appears to be a motivating factor for a lot of voters. \"A lot of these races are tight right now, but this is not the sort of environment where late-deciding voters are going to break for Democrats,\" the consultant said, adding that with Democrats in tight races but under 50% right now, it's tough to imagine all of them breaking in favor of the party that holds the White House.\n\nThose Democrats include the ones fighting for their jobs in all seven of these toss-ups. Remember that the GOP only needs to win three of these, and the most recent polling, which could clearly change between now and election day, suggests extremely close margins or a Republican advantage in all of them:\n\n* Alaska (Republican up 50-44 in CNN/ORC poll)\n* Arkansas (Republican up 45-41 in CBS/NYT/YouGov poll)\n* Louisiana (Republican up 47-41 in CBS/NYT YouGov poll)\n* Colorado (Democrat up 48-45 in CBS/NYT/YouGov poll)\n* New Hampshire (Democrat up 48-41 in CBS/NYT/YouGov poll)\n* North Carolina (Democrat up 47-45 in USA Today/Suffolk poll)\n\n\"It's going to be bad,\" the consultant said. \"Not 2010 bad, but bad.\" Even hapless House GOP candidates running against popular incumbents are proving competitive, the consultant reports. \"You can see why Eric Cantor went down\u2014people are just so anti-Washington, and that's particularly a problem with Democrats because of ties\" to the president. \"People feel hopeless and think that Washington isn't doing anything.\"",
    " Title: Massachusetts State House Insiders Reflect on Mitt Romney's Tenure as Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the halls of the Massachusetts State House, memories of Mitt Romney's tenure as governor remain vivid, with longtime lawmakers on both sides of the aisle recalling a leader who, while effective in passing key legislation, was sometimes alienated by his CEO-style approach.\n\nRomney, who served as governor from 2003 to 2007, is often praised for his work with a predominantly Democratic legislature to tackle the state's problems. In a campaign event last year in Nashua, New Hampshire, Romney noted, \"It did not take a rocket scientist to figure out if I was going to do anything as governor, I had to have a working relationship with the Democrats.\"\n\nHowever, inside the State House, lawmakers remember a more business-oriented leader. Robert Hedlund, the second-ranking Republican in the state Senate, said Romney tried to carry over the corporate culture that existed at his former private investment firm, Bain Capital, a style that sometimes alienated Democrats who were accustomed to a different way of doing things.\n\nRomney replaced many career bureaucrats in the executive staff with private sector outsiders. At times, Hedlund argued, this management structure produced results in balancing the state's budget.\n\nAcross the aisle, Romney still gets positive reviews for his willingness to work with Democrats to pass health care reform. However, many rank-and-file Democrats are still bothered by what they describe as a distant and guarded leader.\n\nState Rep. Frank Smizik, chairman of the House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change, recalled, \"He had three security people around him, and you could never get to touch him or say hello.\" Smizik also noted Romney's unprecedented move to block off one State House elevator specifically for the governor's office, a decision that drew criticism from other lawmakers.\n\nState Rep. Ellen Story said the elevator restrictions and security ropes installed outside Romney's office turned off some lawmakers for good. \"When Romney came in, he treated government like the only thing he ever knew, which was big business, and he was the CEO of the big business,\" Story said.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. John Scibak was far more blunt in his feelings about Romney. \"Many people said, 'Good riddance. Don't let the door hit you on the way out,'\" Scibak said about Romney's decision to forgo a second term to run for the presidency in 2008.\n\nAides to the Romney campaign chalked up some of the hard feelings among State House Democrats to election-time loyalties to President Barack Obama. But the campaign called on another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Jim Vallee, to offer some positive comments on Romney's time as governor.\n\n\"I think you're getting a lot of partisan political comments,\" Vallee said in reference to the Democratic criticism of Romney. \"Did he have an ego? Absolutely,\" Vallee said. \"But what do you expect?\" he asked, describing Romney as \"high-caliber.\"\n\nMike Widmer, a government watchdog with the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, noted Romney set aside his CEO approach to woo Democratic leaders to pass health care reform. The law, widely considered Romney's signature achievement, is memorialized in his official State House portrait, sitting on a small table along with a framed picture of the former governor's wife, Ann.\n\nRomney struggled in other areas such as job creation, Widmer said, in part because of the governor's CEO style. However, Romney was beginning to divert his attention to pursuing the White House, Widmer and other state lawmakers recalled.\n\n\"He clearly had his sights set on running nationally,\" Widmer said. \"That was no secret. Certainly not among the political leaders.\"\n\nState House insiders often contrast Romney's style with another recent Republican governor, William Weld, who seemed to revel in the kind of behind-closed-doors backslapping that Democrats had come to expect over the years.\n\nDemocratic leaders, who now dominate the Massachusetts State House and control the governor's office, gleefully note the rope lines are gone, and the Romney executive elevator has since been reopened to the general public. Romney's Democratic successor, Gov. Deval Patrick, conceded he made those changes after taking office.\n\n\"I'm a governor of, with, and for the people. We have a different style in that respect,\" Patrick said, adding he has great respect for Romney. Vallee noted Patrick has also upset Democratic lawmakers with his reform efforts.\n\n\"You can pick apart any of these guys,\" Vallee said.",
    " Title: National Vigil for Gun Violence Victims Held at Washington National Cathedral\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence, organized by the Newtown Foundation and the National Cathedral, took place on Thursday, with hundreds gathering to honor the memories of those lost to gun violence. Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse, was among the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, last year, attended the vigil seeking solace.\n\n\"I found peace here when I came for Easter, and hopefully I can find that peace again today,\" Heslin said. \"I'm not here for any political reason. I'm just here to honor Jesse.\"\n\nAfter three minutes of church bells tolling to honor the 30,000 people killed by gun violence in the past year, a series of multi-faith leaders offered prayers for an end to the violence.\n\n\"We gather to say 'No more,'\" said Rev. Mel Kawakami of the Newtown United Methodist Church. \"America must not allow these kinds of massacres...to take place,\" said Dr. Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education. \"Only then can we call this nation a perfect union.\"\n\nRelatives of victims from various shooting incidents, including the massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary, the Empire State Building, and the Aurora, Colorado, theater, shared their stories and expressed their pain.\n\n\"We stand with you through your trials and hard times,\" said Anthony Hardmon, 15. His 19-year-old sister, Ashley, was shot to death five months ago near their Chicago home. \"You're not alone.\"\n\nSome who spoke urged stricter gun control legislation, both at the local level and in Washington. Rev. Gary Hall, the dean of the National Cathedral, also plans to dedicate this Sunday's sermon to victims of gun violence.\n\nInside the cathedral, TV monitors displayed a constant loop of gun violence victims. Outside, a group of women wore sashes made from yellow and black tape, similar to police tape, that read \"Stop Gun Violence.\"\n\nBabe Healy King said the Newtown massacre was a \"tipping point\" for her and her friends to start the group and raise awareness of the gun violence that has continued after Newtown. They wrapped trees in their Chevy Chase, Maryland, neighborhood with the tape and hope it mobilizes support for stiffer gun laws.\n\n\"People are numb (to gun violence),\" said King, 68. \"I hope there will be a huge explosion of people standing up and trying to make a difference.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Secures Easy Primary Victory in Wisconsin\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a decisive victory, House Speaker Paul Ryan has emerged as the winner in his re-election bid in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, defeating businessman Paul Nehlen by a significant margin.\n\nRyan, who has represented the district since 1998, attributed his win to the strong support he enjoys in the area. \"We knew we were going to do well,\" Ryan said after the election. \"We got the votes we were hoping and expecting to get all along. The outcome is exactly what we were hoping for.\"\n\nNehlen, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump in the final days before the primary, was unable to overcome Ryan's popularity in the district. Despite Trump's initial support, he endorsed Ryan days later under pressure from Republican leadership.\n\nRyan's primary win is not seen as a reflection on Trump's presidential prospects in Wisconsin. \"I don't think it means he's doomed in November,\" Ryan said of Trump. \"I think it means right here in Wisconsin, people know me very, very well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the primary's other top race was in northeastern Wisconsin, where GOP Rep. Reid Ribble's retirement opened a swing congressional seat. Mike Gallagher, a former Marine who served as national security adviser for Gov. Scott Walker's presidential campaign last year, handily defeated two opponents in the Republican primary.\n\nGallagher, who is a political outsider, said his campaign benefited from his lack of experience in politics and his national security background. \"This is a year when being an outsider, being someone who is not part of the system and having national security experience resonated with a lot of people,\" Gallagher said.\n\nGallagher will face Tom Nelson, the Democratic Outagamie County executive, in the general election. Nelson touted his experience in a news release after Gallagher's win. \"For too long, Washington has been paralyzed by partisan bickering and gridlock,\" Nelson said. \"I'm running for Congress because we need more people with the experience and the skills necessary to represent northeast Wisconsin.\"\n\nRyan will face Democrat Ryan Solen, an Iraq war veteran, in the Nov. 8 general election. Three other congressional incumbents\u2014Democrats Gwen Moore and Ron Kind and Republican Sean Duffy\u2014all won.\n\nIn an unusual legislative race, incumbent Democratic state Sen. Lena Taylor easily dispatched with a challenge from state Rep. Mandela Barnes. No Republican was running in the Milwaukee race, making it all but certain Taylor would retain the seat.",
    " Title: Trump Announces \"Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been described as a provocative stunt, President Donald Trump has announced plans to host \"The Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year\" on Monday at 5:00 p.m. The event aims to recognize instances of \"dishonesty & bad reporting\" in various categories from the media industry.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when the president is embroiled in a public feud with former advisor Steve Bannon and is facing criticism for his comments about North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The awards ceremony, if it indeed takes place, is expected to generate significant media coverage, with Trump's critics and supporters alike expressing their opinions on the matter.\n\nThe categories for the awards are yet to be announced, but it is widely speculated that media outlets that are frequent targets of the White House, such as CNN and The New York Times, will be among the \"winners.\" It is also expected that the recipients, except in cases where they have retracted false stories, will view the awards as a badge of honor.\n\nNotably, late-night comedian Stephen Colbert, known for his anti-Trump stance, has expressed interest in receiving an award. He has purchased a Times Square billboard that lists \"For Your Consideration\" in an Oscars-style manner, citing humorous reasons for his nomination, such as \"Outstanding Achievement in Parroting George Soros' Talking Points\" and \"Least Breitbarty.\"\n\nTrevor Noah's \"Daily Show\" has also displayed a \"For Your Consideration\" graphic on its Twitter feed.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the awards will win the president any additional votes or advance his agenda, they are expected to appeal to his base, which already distrusts the press and enjoys the president's media-bashing. Trump's approach to his presidency, characterized by his frequent use of Twitter and his ability to drive the news cycle, suggests that he views his presidency as an hour-by-hour exercise in programming.\n\nThe media dishonesty awards are expected to be a brief distraction, but Trump is likely to enjoy the attention they generate. The event, if it takes place, will provide a unique insight into the president's media-bashing tactics and his relationship with the press.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Accuses Tech Companies of Censorship, Calls for Antitrust Legislation and Reform of Section 230\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Attorney General William Barr accused technology companies, including Google and Twitter, of attempting to censor content, citing recent incidents involving conservative news sites and senators' accounts.\n\nBarr's comments came in response to NBC's apparent influence over Google in punishing two conservative news sites, The Federalist and ZeroHedge, for allegedly offensive coverage of the protests following the death of George Floyd. Google later disputed NBC's claims, stating that The Federalist was never demonetized and that they had worked with the site to address issues related to the comments section.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also brought up the issue, stating that Twitter tried to permanently lock down his account if he refused to censor his tweets on the topic of riots and looting.\n\nBarr explained that tech companies initially gained their strong market position by marketing themselves as open to all comers, but have since started to censor different viewpoints. He noted that this concentration of power in the hands of a few large companies poses a fundamental problem because it allows for the quick galvanization of public opinion and the suppression of minority viewpoints.\n\nThe Attorney General went on to say that the Department of Justice is pushing Congress to pass new legislation that would hold Facebook, Twitter, and other tech behemoths accountable for what is posted on their platforms. The DOJ's proposals would require online platforms to better police their sites for illicit and harmful material and to take a more objective approach in deciding what content they deem objectionable and decide to take down.\n\nThe DOJ is also calling for lawmakers to update the outdated immunity for online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The DOJ's news release stated that the changes would address problems arising from Section 230, which encourages platforms to take down objectionable material without making them publishers. However, the DOJ argues that tech companies have started taking down viewpoints and engaging in selective censorship, which should make them publishers.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also introduced legislation on Wednesday that would give Americans the ability to sue major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter if they engage in selective censorship of political speech. The DOJ's proposals and Sen. Hawley's legislation, if passed, would roll back protections that technology companies have enjoyed for decades.",
    " Title: Analysis of the Second Democratic Primary Debate: A Mixed Performance for Candidates\n\nThe second Democratic primary debate saw a heated exchange of ideas and policies among the 2020 presidential hopefuls. The night was marked by a critical assessment of the candidates' performances, with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker being praised for his strong showing, former Vice President Joe Biden clearing a low bar, and Senator Kamala Harris failing to meet expectations.\n\nCory Booker, in particular, was commended for his optimistic demeanor and powerful discussions on criminal justice reform and immigration. He also made a significant point about the need for more ambitious action on climate change, arguing that the bar for action has been raised and rejoining the Paris climate agreement is not enough.\n\nThe healthcare debate between Biden and Harris remained unresolved, with both candidates struggling to provide clear answers on key issues. Harris' answers on health care were criticized for their lack of clarity, while Biden was noted for his apparent confusion over copays and deductibles. The core disagreement between the two front-runners remained consistent: Harris advocates for a fundamental overhaul of the system to cover everyone, while Biden supports building on the current system to cover more, but not all, people.\n\nSenator Harris' performance was described as less dynamic compared to her first debate, with her answers on health care continuing to lack clarity. Both Harris and Booker are in a similar position, needing Biden to falter to gain an advantage. However, at this point, Biden's lead remains strong.\n\nBiden's performance was deemed \"perfectly adequate,\" with improvements from his lackluster first debate. He was energetic, prepared, and held his own despite facing a barrage of questions. However, he was criticized for seeming over-rehearsed, struggling with technology, and at times appearing stunned by the intensity of the debate.\n\nThe candidates' approach to former President Barack Obama was also a topic of discussion. While they praised Obama as a person, they seemed to be running against certain Obama policies. Despite Obama's popularity and his departure from office being less than three years ago, the Democratic Party is moving towards more progressive policies. However, the candidate most closely associated with Obama, Joe Biden, continues to lead the polls.\n\nIn conclusion, the second Democratic primary debate was a night of intense debate and critical assessment. Candidates' performances varied, with Booker shining, Biden clearing a low bar, and Harris failing to meet expectations. The healthcare debate between Harris and Biden remained unresolved, and both candidates struggled to provide clear answers on key issues. The candidates' approach to Obama and his legacy also raised questions about the direction the Democratic Party is taking.",
    " Title: China Plans to Deploy Nuclear-Armed Submarines in Pacific Amidst South China Sea Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Chinese military is reportedly planning to send nuclear-armed submarines for patrols in the Pacific Ocean for the first time. This move comes amidst ongoing territorial disputes over islands in the region, particularly in the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to a report by The Guardian, citing Chinese military officials, the exact timing for the maiden patrol has not been determined yet. However, Beijing insists that such a move is inevitable.\n\nThe announcement comes days after U.S. President Barack Obama lifted a decades-long arms embargo against Vietnam. Chinese officials have publicly praised the move, but a state-run newspaper warned that any attempt to enlist Vietnam in an effort to contain China could potentially escalate regional tensions and lead to conflicts in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated on Monday that it was China's actions in the South and East China Seas that could create a volatile situation. \"I would caution China to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon has reported that China has reclaimed more than 3,200 acres of land in the South China Sea and is developing and building military installations on the man-made islands. This has led to a strengthening of the relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam, reflecting growing Vietnamese concern over Chinese moves to assert its maritime claims.\n\nHistorically, tensions between China and Vietnam over their conflicting claims in the South China Sea have resulted in fatalities. In 1988, clashes between the two countries resulted in the deaths of dozens of people. Tensions resurfaced in 2014, when China parked an oil rig off Vietnam's central coast, leading to confrontations at sea and deadly anti-China riots in Vietnam.\n\nLast week, the Pentagon reported that two Chinese fighter jets flew dangerously close to a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane, an incident termed as an \"unsafe intercept.\" China responded by demanding that the U.S. end surveillance patrols around the South China Sea, with a foreign ministry spokesman claiming that such missions \"seriously endanger Chinese maritime security.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of China\u2019s Fiery Cross reef, an artificial island created after months of dredging operations. This was the third time the Navy sailed a warship close to a contested Chinese island in what the Pentagon calls \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d operations. Beijing responded by scrambling fighter jets to express its displeasure.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions and Allegations Spark Constitutional Concerns, Raise Questions on Executive Power\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that have sent shockwaves through the political landscape, President Donald Trump has initiated an inquiry into claims that the FBI infiltrated his campaign, marking a significant escalation in his ongoing battle with the Justice Department. This move, which has been met with concern from both political parties and constitutional scholars, has raised questions about the boundaries of executive power and the independence of the judiciary.\n\nOn Monday, Trump called for an investigation into the alleged infiltration of his campaign, a claim that was first propagated in conservative media. The President delivered this order to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during an Oval Office meeting. In a strategic move, Rosenstein has reportedly asked the department's inspector general to look into Trump's claim, and top Justice Department officials will share highly classified information with lawmakers related to the Russia investigation.\n\nHowever, the fact that such a conversation took place at all underscores the extraordinary times in Washington, where a President has turned on his own Justice Department and is urging his political followers to do the same. This situation, according to Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency under presidents of both parties, is \"a little scary.\"\n\nHayden, speaking on CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" expressed concern that Trump's actions are pushing the boundaries of the presidency, potentially undermining the independence of the judiciary, a norm that, according to Hayden, keeps the President within the confines of his constitutional role.\n\nThe events of recent days have raised questions about whether the President is using his power to subvert an investigation into his own alleged misconduct. Given his relentless attacks on former President Barack Obama and his senior intelligence chiefs, it also seems possible that a sitting President could use the weight of his office to launch investigations into his political enemies, a step unheard of in American politics.\n\nTrump's actions may have been technically within his rights, but they have sparked widespread concern about the erosion of the independence of the judiciary and the Department of Justice. The President's incessant pressure on the Justice Department and the FBI has led many to question whether he is using his position to further a political campaign rather than uphold the rule of law.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Trump sent out a campaign blast email to his supporters on Monday, calling on them to sign a petition to force an investigation into \"whether Obama's FBI and DOJ infiltrated or surveilled our campaign for political purposes.\" The email, signed by Trump, declared that this could be \"the greatest political scandal in American history.\"\n\nDemocrats have criticized the move as a sign of a President \"raging out of control,\" while some of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill have expressed discomfort with his latest actions. Utah's GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch told CNN that \"the question is whether it's advisable or not.\"\n\nReports suggest that a loose and informal group of Trump advisers outside the White House have been pushing the President to attack Rosenstein and to frame him as part of a \"deep state\" plot against the White House. This campaign, using Trump-friendly media and the President himself, appears to be an attempt to force Rosenstein to reveal details about the investigation that both the Justice Department and FBI do not want disclosed.\n\nDespite the ongoing investigation, it is crucial to note that the FBI did not insert an informant into the Trump campaign. Rather, the use of an asset is standard practice in counterintelligence operations, intended to gather information from campaign advisers who may have been the targets of a Russian espionage operation.\n\nThe erosion of the reality and the appearance of the independence of the judiciary and the Department of Justice, as well as the special counsel, is a matter of significant concern for many. As Michael Hayden stated, \"We are eroding the reality and the appearance of the independence of the judiciary and the Department of Justice and the special counsel.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the actions of President Trump have raised serious questions about the boundaries of executive power, the independence of the judiciary, and the rule of law. As the nation watches this unfold, it remains to be seen how these events will shape the future of American politics and the presidency.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions' Interpretation of Romans 13 Sparks Controversy Among Religious Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nIndianapolis \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions' citation of a Bible passage during a speech in Fort Wayne, Indiana, has sparked a heated debate among religious leaders and immigration advocates. Sessions, who is also a Sunday school teacher at a United Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, used Romans 13 to defend the Trump administration's policy of separating parents from their children at the border.\n\nThe policy, launched in May, forcibly removes children traveling with parents caught at the border and places them in government care. Sessions argued that the goal of the policy is not to cause harm to children but to crack down on potential child trafficking or abuse and discourage parents from bringing their children on the often-dangerous border crossing.\n\nHowever, some who share Sessions' faith disagree with his interpretation of the passage. Mike Mather, the senior pastor at Broadway UMC in Indianapolis, stated, \"If you read the first 11 chapters of Romans, you get a pretty good idea of what the context of that community was. If you read [Chapter] 12, you see love is supposed to be the guiding force...[Sessions] didn't read on very far.\"\n\nRomans 12 includes the line, \"Contribute to the needs of God\u2019s people, and welcome strangers into your home.\" These verses, Mather said, seem to run contrary to the policy Sessions was defending.\n\nIn response to Sessions' comments, a group of religious leaders from the United Methodist Church, Islamic Society of North America, Union for Reform Judaism, Mennonite Church, and 20 other diverse religious organizations released a joint statement criticizing the policy.\n\nSessions, in his speech, defended the policy and stated, \"I do not believe scripture or church history or reason condemns a secular nation state for having reasonable immigration laws.\"\n\nHowever, public backing for the policy, and the religious argument that Sessions used to support it, has been hard to come by. The use of Romans 13 has a history of being employed by government officials in defense of their decisions or edicts.\n\nThe Rev. Rob Saler, executive director for the Center for Pastoral Excellence at Indianapolis' Christian Theological Seminary, noted that Romans 13 was used by Lutherans in Nazi Germany to justify supporting Adolf Hitler. He added, \"Romans 13, for a long time, has been appealed to in an incorrect way, as a justification for 'Obey the laws, no matter what, whether they're just or not.'\"\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, stated, \"It is invoked by defenders of the South or defenders of slavery to ward off abolitionists who believed that slavery is wrong.\"\n\nSaler also noted that it's important to consider when Paul wrote Romans. At that time, Christians were being executed by the Roman Empire, he said. What Paul was penning, Saler added, was meant to be a road map to living a gentler life full of charity, a stark contrast to how Paul would have viewed the empire.\n\nMather echoed that sentiment, stating, \"It's flat-out irresponsible [for Sessions] to use it without attention to the broader context.\" He added, \"It's basically practical advice: While you're doing this, sure, go ahead and pay your taxes, give the government its due. But taken as a whole, Romans stands as a counter to unjust government and unjust rule.\"",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis: Biden's South Carolina Strategy Mirrors Jeb Bush's in 2016, Yet Results Differ Significantly\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a striking parallel to the 2016 Republican primary, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's strategy in the South Carolina primary mirrors that of Jeb Bush, who, on paper, bore a striking resemblance to Biden. Both candidates were closely associated with their party's last president, led in early polls, struggled in debates, and underperformed in Iowa and New Hampshire. Both candidates staked their comeback on a strong showing in South Carolina.\n\nJeb Bush's strategy in South Carolina was reminiscent of Biden's current approach. In the final week before the South Carolina primary, Bush positioned himself as the defender of his party's old guard. At a debate, he contrasted the insurgent Donald Trump's nativist stance with former President George W. Bush's more welcoming message. Bush emphasized the positive contributions of immigrants, stating, \"The great majority of immigrants are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling.\"\n\nBush also defended his brother's response to 9/11 during the debate, countering Trump's accusations of dishonesty regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \"While Donald Trump was building a reality-TV show,\" Bush retorted, \"my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I'm proud of what he did.\"\n\nBush, according to The New York Times, \"seems to be embracing his inner dynast, joking about his family in speeches, pointing out relatives in his crowds, and going out of his way to speak with pride about his father's and brother's achievements.\" Two days before the primary, he brought his brother to South Carolina to campaign.\n\nBiden, in a similar vein, has emphasized his relationship with former President Barack Obama in his South Carolina campaign. Although he failed to secure Obama's endorsement, Biden has made the \"Obama-Biden\" administration the centerpiece of his campaign. His surrogates have repeated Obama's campaign chant, \"Fired up, ready to go.\" Biden frequently refers to the \"Obama-Biden\" administration in speeches and uses Obama as a cudgel against his opponents.\n\nOne Biden ad accused Bernie Sanders of trying to \"destroy Obama's legacy\" by replacing the Affordable Care Act with Medicare for All. Another ad criticized Sanders for considering \"challenging our first African American president in a primary\" in 2012. Similar to Bush's reliance on an endorsement from Lindsey Graham, Biden has touted his support from Jim Clyburn, the long-serving Democratic representative from South Carolina.\n\nThe results, however, could not have been more different. Bush lost to Trump in South Carolina by 25 points and quickly dropped out of the race. Biden, on the other hand, beat Sanders by 29 points and, buoyed by a new series of high-profile endorsements, went on to beat him in a slew of other states last night.",
    " Title: Obama Administration and House Republicans Remain at Odds Over Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing negotiations between President Obama and House Republicans regarding the \"fiscal cliff,\" it appears that both parties have drawn a clear line in the sand. The central issue at hand is the increase in tax rates for the wealthy, with the only question being the extent of the increase.\n\nTreasury Secretary Tim Geithner, in an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" stated unequivocally, \"Those rates are going to have to go up. There's no responsible way we can govern this country at a time of enormous threat, and risk, and challenge... with those low rates in place for future generations.\"\n\nHowever, the president's plan, as presented last week by Geithner, has left the two sides significantly apart. In a discussion on \"Fox News Sunday,\" House Speaker John Boehner expressed his surprise, stating, \"I was flabbergasted. I looked at him and said, 'You can't be serious.'\" Boehner further added, \"The president's idea of negotiation is: Roll over and do what I ask.\"\n\nThe president's proposal includes an additional $1.6 trillion in tax revenue over the next 10 years, including a return of the tax rate on income above $250,000 a year to 39.6 percent. In exchange, the president suggests $600 billion in cuts to Medicare and other programs. House Republicans argue that this is not sufficient, but have not publicly detailed their proposed cuts.\n\nGeithner stated that the ball is now in the Republicans' court, and the White House seems content to wait for the Republicans to present their proposals. \"They have to come to us and tell us what they think they need. What we can't do is to keep guessing,\" he said.\n\nThe president is also advocating for additional stimulus spending totaling $200 billion for unemployment benefits, training, and infrastructure projects. House Speaker Boehner commented, \"All of this stimulus spending would literally be more than the spending cuts that he was willing to put on the table.\"\n\nBoehner also expressed skepticism over the president's proposal to strip Congress of power over the country's debt level, and whether it should be raised. \"Congress is not going to give up this power,\" he said. \"It's the only way to leverage the political process to produce more change than what it would if left alone.\"\n\nThe so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts, is set to take effect on Jan. 1 if Congress and the White House do not reach a deficit-cutting deal beforehand. The tax increases could cost the average family between $2,000 and $2,400 a year, which, coupled with the $500 billion in spending cuts, could potentially push the country back into recession, according to economists.",
    " Title: Biden's 2008 Arrest Allegation Resurfaces: A Look Back at the Incident and Its Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recently resurfaced clip from 2008, Joe Biden, then the Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate, was reported to have admitted to being arrested more than 40 years ago for entering a women's dormitory at Ohio University. The incident, which took place on October 15, 2008, was reported by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the network's 'Political Ticker.'\n\nAccording to the report, Biden jokingly recounted the incident during a speech to supporters near Ohio University's campus. He stated that he had mistakenly followed a group of young women into the all-female dormitory, an action that led to his arrest. Biden described the incident as a \"temporary detention.\"\n\nCBS News also published an article on the same day, reporting on Biden's remarks. In this account, Biden recalled wandering into the dormitory, being arrested by a police officer, and being told that men were not allowed in women's dormitories \"back in those days.\"\n\nAn article on CNN's Political Ticker blog documented Biden's alleged remarks as being nearly identical to the remarks from the CBS News report. The blog post also noted that Biden, during his speech, emphasized that he had not breached the first floor of the dormitory.\n\nThis incident, while a light-hearted anecdote during Biden's 2008 campaign, has resurfaced in the current political climate, sparking discussions and debates. The incident serves as a reminder of the evolving societal norms and attitudes towards gender and privacy over the past few decades.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588, a leading provider of conservative news, offers inside access to the most important, relevant, and engaging stories of the day.

    " Title: U.S. Attorney General Nominee Loretta Lynch and Senator Jeff Sessions Discuss Immigration and Law Enforcement\n\nIn a heated exchange during a Senate hearing on January 28, 2014, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and U.S. Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch debated the rights of lawful immigrants, unauthorized immigrants, and American citizens in the workforce.\n\nSessions questioned Lynch, stating, \"In the workplace of America today when we have a high number of unemployed, we\u2019ve had declining wages for many years, we have the lowest of Americans working, who has more right to a job in this country? A lawful immigrant who\u2019s here, a green-card holder or a citizen, or a person who entered the country unlawfully?\"\n\nLynch responded, \"The right and the obligation to work is one that\u2019s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. Certainly, if someone here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace.\"\n\nSessions continued, \"We\u2019re talking about rights\u2014who has the most rights? Does a lawful American immigrant or citizen have the right to have the laws of the United States enforced so that they might be able to work, or does a person who came here unlawfully have a right to demand a job?\"\n\nLynch countered, \"Certainly, the benefits of citizenship confer greater rights on those of who are citizens than those who are not.\"\n\nIn a separate exchange, Lynch spoke about the challenges faced by law enforcement officers and the importance of community engagement. She said, \"Many of our community residents, because of a host of factors, feel disconnected from government in general today, and when they interact with law enforcement, transfer that feeling to them as well, even if someone is there to help. What I have found most effective is getting people together and simply listening to their concerns, being open, helping them see that, in fact, we are all in this together and that the concerns of law enforcement, a safe society, a free society are the exact same concerns of every resident of every community there.\"",
    " Title: ACLU's Controversial Tweet on Catcalling Sparks Debate Over Free Speech and Civil Liberties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) appeared to advocate for a ban on catcalling, reminiscent of France's approach, in a now-deleted tweet. The tweet, captured in a screenshot, has sparked a debate over free speech, civil liberties, and the role of the ACLU in upholding these principles.\n\nThe proposed U.S. ban on catcalling, defined as street harassment of women, would likely infringe upon the First Amendment, particularly if the law is not narrowly tailored to prohibit severe, pervasive, objectively offensive conduct or threatening behavior. Such a law might face opposition from the Supreme Court, as seen in the Snyder v. Phelps case.\n\nWhile catcalling is undeniably obnoxious, the government's role in preventing such verbal interactions in public is questionable. This perspective is shared by many anti-catcalling groups, who understand that criminalizing such behavior could potentially undermine other important goals, such as criminal justice reform.\n\nThe ACLU's call for a catcalling ban seems to indicate a lack of understanding of the potential implications on civil liberties, particularly in light of the disproportionate impact on poor people, immigrants, and people of color if such laws were enforced.\n\nIt is important to note that this single tweet may not signify a broader shift in the ACLU's stance on free speech. It is more likely that this was the action of a social media editor. However, the fact that such a perspective was expressed by someone within the ACLU, an organization known for its commitment to free speech, is concerning.\n\nThis incident echoes previous concerns raised by former ACLU board member Wendy Kaminer, who suggested that the ACLU's commitment to free speech may be waning. Nadine Strossen, a former ACLU president, disputed this characterization.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the ACLU's tweet raises questions about the organization's commitment to free speech and its role in upholding civil liberties. Some fear that the ACLU is prioritizing generic lefty social justice goals over its traditional role as a civil liberties organization. This perception is further reinforced by the apparent lack of understanding within the ACLU about the potential implications of a catcalling ban on civil liberties.",
    " Title: California Democratic Party's Shift: A Look at the Unprecedented Leftward Swing and Its Potential Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the California Democratic Party has shown a significant shift towards the left, as evidenced by the recent refusal to endorse long-standing Senator Dianne Feinstein for a fifth term in the U.S. Senate. This move, reminiscent of her 1990 gubernatorial loss to Republican Pete Wilson, highlights a stark change in the political landscape of the state.\n\nFeinstein, often characterized as a centrist Democrat, has been reliably left of center, with a lifetime rating of 9.15 from the American Conservative Union, and an 85 rating from the left-leaning Americans for Democratic Action. However, her voting record has not been enough to secure the party's endorsement, with only 37 percent of delegates' votes at the late February annual party convention.\n\nThe opposition to Feinstein, led by State Senator Kevin de Le\u00f3n, gained momentum due to several factors. De Le\u00f3n has taken a harder stance against the Trump administration and has positioned himself as a young, energetic leader ready to tackle the issues the party is currently focusing on. De Le\u00f3n, a union organizer, is contrasted with Feinstein, a multimillionaire perceived as comfortable in her wealth.\n\nThe shift in the California Democratic Party could signal a more progressive approach to governance, but it also raises concerns about the state's future. California, once known as the Golden State, is grappling with a host of economic and social issues. Public-employee pensions have become a fiscal time bomb, taxation continues to increase, businesses have fled due to a hostile commercial and regulatory environment, the middle class is dwindling, the poverty rate is the nation's highest, and the state's quality of life has been ranked the worst in the nation.\n\nThe state's homeless problem is a national embarrassment, its housing crisis remains unaddressed, and its public school system is failing students and parents. If the Democratic Party's leftward swing indeed resonates with voters, California could face a 2020s version of a 1980s Rust Belt state, where economies, prospects, and populations recede at alarming rates.\n\nThis shift in the California Democratic Party could have far-reaching implications, not only for the state but also for the nation as a whole. As the party continues to lean further left, it remains to be seen how this will impact California's political landscape and the direction of the country.",
    " Title: DNC Forms Cybersecurity Advisory Board in Response to Data Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the data breach that led to the leak of thousands of internal party emails, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has established a cybersecurity advisory board, according to a report by Politico on Thursday. The four-member board, detailed in a memo by interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, is aimed at preventing future cyber attacks and enhancing the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nThe memo, penned by Ms. Brazile, states, \"To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class, I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field.\" The board will work closely with the DNC to ensure the party is prepared for cyber threats.\n\nMs. Brazile described the attack as an \"illegal cyber attack by state-sponsored Russian hackers,\" according to the Wall Street Journal. She emphasized the DNC's commitment to cybersecurity and privacy, stating, \"I am personally committed to doing everything possible to prevent an incident of this magnitude from happening again.\"\n\nFederal investigators believe the DNC was one of several entities associated with the Democratic Party to be targeted by hackers, widely assumed to be agents of the Russian government. According to Reuters, members of Congress were warned of the cyber campaign last summer, but details of the DNC breach were not disclosed publicly until last month after the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks published thousands of emails stolen from the committee's servers on the eve of its convention.\n\nIn addition to the release of emails that led to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair, the leaked emails also included credit-card data and other sensitive information concerning DNC staffers and their contacts. Affected individuals will receive assistance to help mitigate any threats to their financial security, according to Ms. Brazile's memo.\n\nThe inaugural members of the new DNC board, as reported by Politico, include Rand Beers, former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Nicole Wong, a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter; Aneesh Chopra, co-founder of Hunch Analytics; and Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor. Ms. Wong and Mr. Chopra both previously held positions as technology officers with the federal government, according to Politico.",
    " Title: Divergent Views on Easing Social Distancing: Trump, Health Advisers Disagree on Approach to Reopening Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast of opinions, President Donald Trump and two of his top public health advisers have expressed differing stances on when and how the decision to ease social distancing measures will be made.\n\nPresident Trump, in a recent interview with Fox News, stated that his decision on adjusting federal social distancing guidelines and asking businesses to reopen would be based on \"a lot of facts and a lot of instincts.\" However, in separate appearances on CNN's State of the Union and ABC's Meet the Press, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, emphasized that their recommendations would be based solely on data and avoided making firm or sweeping predictions.\n\nDr. Fauci and Dr. Hahn highlighted the complexity of the situation and the need for a data-driven approach, cautioning against setting a specific timeline for the entire country to return to normal. \"It is not going to be a light switch that we say, \u2018 Okay it\u2019s now June, July whatever\u2019 \u2014 click, the light switch goes back on,\" Fauci said on CNN. \"It\u2019s going to be depending where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak that you already experienced, and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced.\"\n\nPresident Trump has expressed a desire to see relaxed social distancing and businesses reopened as soon as possible. Less than three weeks ago, he stated that he hoped to have the economy \"opened up and raring to go by Easter,\" a goal that both health officials and economists warned would accelerate the spread of the coronavirus and likely lead to the rapid reshuttering of the economy. Recent reports suggest the president now hopes to begin a return to normal by May 1, and there is growing pressure from some of his non-scientific advisers and Fox News personalities to do so.\n\nOn Fox News' Justice with Judge Jeanine, Trump emphasized that conditions would allow the economy to begin returning to normal \"soon,\" and when asked how he will decide when is the right time to advise businesses to reopen, the president gave a less measured answer than Fauci. \"I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors, and business leaders,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. And it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it. But we have to get our country back.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the president's stance on his administration's coronavirus response hasn't exactly aligned with the stance of his experts. The contrast between Trump's eagerness to reopen the country based on his gut feelings and the cautious rhetoric of top health officials does help underscore how Trump's decision-making process on the coronavirus is detached from expert counsel and haphazard in its execution.\n\nTrump's health officials have been far more cautious and hesitant to offer gut-level appraisals about the future of the economy or when it will be safe to end social distancing. When asked if May 1 was \"a good target\" for reopening the economy, Dr. Hahn responded by declining to set a date for the decision. \"It is a target, and obviously we\u2019re hopeful about that target, but I think it\u2019s just too early to be able to tell that we see light at the end of the tunnel,\" Hahn said. \"I think it\u2019s just too early for us to say whether May 1 is that date.\"\n\nBoth health officials have also been careful to temper the optimism some have felt in seeing the confirmed case rate begin to decrease in a number of coronavirus hotspots. When asked if the worst has passed with coronavirus infections, Dr. Hahn said that the models show that \"we\u2019re very close to the peak,\" but emphasized that it's important to \"take this day by day as the data come in, because this has to be a data-driven approach.\"\n\nWhether the president takes these words to heart remains to be seen. But he has signaled recently he intends to create a concrete plan to see the economy functioning as normal again. Friday, he said he'll announce the members of a new \"opening our country task force\" or \"opening our country council\" full of \"great business leaders, great doctors\" and \"some governors\" this week.\n\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

    " Title: Senate Republicans Estimate Billions in Cost for Legalizing Illegal Immigrants, Rubio Disputes Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Senate Republican staffers have estimated that the annual cost to taxpayers of legalizing illegal immigrants could be in the billions, if they use their status to apply for federal benefits from Medicaid and ObamaCare. However, this claim has been challenged by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a key Republican engaged in immigration bill talks.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Budget Committee, in response to an emerging immigration proposal that includes a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, have estimated that the cost could total up to $40 billion in 2022, \"just for Medicaid and ObamaCare.\" The estimates were crunched by budget committee Republican staff.\n\nAlex Conant, spokesman for Sen. Rubio, disputed the numbers, stating in a statement late Thursday that it's not possible to provide cost estimates at this time due to the lack of a legislative proposal. Conant added that Rubio is concerned about the \"potential fiscal impact\" of the bill and will request an \"in-depth\" budget analysis.\n\nRubio, a key member of the \"Gang of Eight\" drafting a proposal, has stressed that he would ensure there are limits on benefits being applied to these individuals. In January, he told a news outlet that the first phase for them would be to get a nonimmigrant visa, not a green card, and that they would not qualify for any federal benefits under that status. However, their eligibility would change once they get a green card.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions' office voiced concern Thursday that a law, which dates back a century and was renewed by Congress in 1996, meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole, would not be applied here. The law is supposed to turn away those immigrants who are likely to become a \"public charge.\" However, the statement Thursday claimed nothing in the current plan would apply to those already in the country before they are granted legal status.\n\nFurther, numbers recently provided by the Department of Homeland Security indicated the \"public charge\" standard is not aggressively enforced. The department found just one case for most of fiscal 2012 where the claim was leveled at an immigrant. \"However, the charge was later withdrawn,\" DHS reported.\n\nDespite widespread reports and speculation about the immigration bill being drafted, a bill has not yet been introduced. Senators are working out the details in hopes of bringing it before Congress in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Positions Herself as Progressive Democratic Front-Runner, Moves Left on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move to capture the young and diverse coalition that propelled President Barack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is positioning herself as the most liberal Democratic front-runner in decades, The Washington Post reported.\n\nClinton's shift to the left on various issues, including gay marriage, immigration, and climate change, among others, is a calculated move by her aides and advisers who have analyzed social and demographic trends and believe it will not harm her among moderate and independent voters in the general election.\n\nJohn Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, described her approach as diving deeply into the problems facing the American people and American families. \"She's a proud wonk,\" Podesta said, \"and she looks at policy from that perspective.\"\n\nAides also believe that Clinton's stances on issues such as paid family leave, a higher minimum wage, and more affordable college will resonate with the public, while detracting from concerns about her hawkish foreign policy views.\n\nClinton's liberal views on climate change, abortion rights, and economic inequality are also notable. The Post reported that her advisers are hoping this will help her avoid a serious challenge from the left while also finding support among the general electorate.\n\nHowever, some political strategists question whether Clinton can replicate the type of coalition Obama won, particularly among nonwhite voters. Nevertheless, they predict that her positions will draw strong support.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress and a longtime Clinton confidant, told The Post, \"The strategic advantage the Democrats have is that the distance between our base and the middle is shorter than for Republicans.\"\n\nClinton has not yet taken positions on the Keystone XL pipeline or Obama's free trade deal, The Post reported, saying she remains cautious about speaking out on two key issues that liberals oppose. However, her advisers predict that her silence will not damage her standing.\n\nConservative America Rising PAC director Colin Reed wrote in a position paper Friday, according to The Post, that Clinton's positioning would backfire. \"Clinton's moves reinforce all her worst attributes as a candidate and hurt her image among voters of all stripes,\" Reed said. \"Progressive voters know that she's not truly one of them,\" while swing voters \"see a desperate politician staking out far-left positions that are outside of the mainstream of most Americans.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Argue for Nationwide Subsidies in Affordable Care Act Case Before Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new brief filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, congressional Democrats involved in drafting the Affordable Care Act (ACA) argued that the law was intended to make health insurance affordable for all Americans, including those in states that do not have their own health insurance exchanges. The case, known as King v. Burwell, could potentially undermine the economic assumptions that the ACA relies on if the court rules against the Obama administration's interpretation of the law.\n\nThe ACA's language states that subsidies will be paid to those in exchanges \"established by the state.\" Opponents argue that this means the federal exchange, which covers the majority of states that did not set up their own exchanges, is not eligible for subsidies. They claim that Congress intended to use the subsidies as an incentive for states to set up their own exchanges.\n\nHowever, the Democratic lawmakers who wrote and passed the law disputed this argument, stating that it is \"so weak\" and that they never intended to draw such a distinction. They argue that the law grants subsidies to \"applicable taxpayers\" and defines them by income, not by geography.\n\nThe Democrats' brief, filed for them by the Constitutional Accountability Center, also points out that the ACA was passed in a convoluted manner. Senate Democrats forced the bill through on Christmas Eve in 2009, expecting to work out differences with the House, which passed a different bill. However, the victory of Scott Brown in a special Senate election in Massachusetts cost Democrats their filibuster-proof majority, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had to resort to using budget gimmicks to force the bill through exactly as it passed the Senate.\n\nFormer Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat who was one of the key votes to get the bill through the Senate, wrote a letter on Tuesday stating that he \"always believed that tax credits should be available in all 50 states regardless of who built the exchange.\"\n\nHouse Republicans who oversee health issues wrote a letter to the Health and Human Services Department on Wednesday, warning it to begin preparing for a range of potential outcomes and consequences of the court's decision. The GOP lawmakers wrote, \"Given HHS's responsibilities, we believe it is prudent that the department plan for the full range of potential outcomes and consequences of the court's decision.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case in June. If the court rules against the Obama administration's interpretation, it could potentially leave millions of Americans without subsidies to help them afford health insurance.",
    " Title: Swing Votes in Kavanaugh Confirmation Process Appear to Favor Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, all five senators considered as swing votes in the confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court have reportedly made their decisions. With enough of them indicating support, his nomination is now likely to pass.\n\nBy the end of the week, the focus was on Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, as well as Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin. Given the Republicans' razor-thin 51-49 majority in the Senate, their collective votes would be crucial in determining whether Kavanaugh is ultimately confirmed.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, all five senators have now revealed their positions. Heitkamp will oppose Kavanaugh, and Murkowski seems likely to do the same. On the other hand, Flake, Collins, and Manchin have signaled their intention to vote in favor.\n\nSen. Susan Collins: In a Friday afternoon floor speech, Collins announced her support for Kavanaugh. She had hinted at this decision on Thursday when she expressed confidence in the FBI report on sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. \"It appears to be a very thorough investigation, but I'm going back later to personally read the interviews,\" Collins told reporters about the FBI report on Thursday. Later in the day, Collins reiterated her sentiment, noting \"I've not yet finished going through all the materials,\" according to CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake: Flake stated on Friday that he intends to vote in support of Kavanaugh unless circumstances change before a floor vote. He told reporters it was a difficult decision, according to NBC News' Alex Moe. Flake also echoed Collins in his reaction to the FBI report. \"I think Susan Collins was quoted saying it was very thorough but no new corroborative information came out of it. That's accurate,\" Flake told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \"I wanted this pause; we've had this pause. We've had the professionals, the FBI, determine\u2014given the scope that we gave them, current credible allegations\u2014to go and do their review, which they've done.\" Flake was at the forefront of calls for a one-week delay on a Kavanaugh vote, which would enable the FBI to conduct an investigation. He voted in favor of limiting debate on the nomination and advancing Kavanaugh to a floor vote on Friday.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski: In a surprising turn, Murkowski voted against limiting debate on the nomination and advancing Kavanaugh to a floor vote on Friday. This vote is likely indicative of how she ultimately plans to vote on Kavanaugh. She seemed to make this clearer to reporters after the vote. \"I believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man,\" she said. \"It just may be that in my view, he's not the right man for the court at this time.\" Previously, Murkowski had been more cautious, noting that she was still working on reading the entirety of the FBI report herself. \"I'm not wasting any daylight here,\" she said on Thursday. She did add, however, that she agreed with an assessment Collins had previously made that Kavanaugh was not likely to overturn Roe v. Wade.",
    " Title: House Republicans Question Obama Administration's Authority in Delaying Health Care Law Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, the Obama administration has delayed a key provision of the health care overhaul, leading to increased scrutiny from House Republicans. The delay pertains to a requirement that large employers offer access to health insurance, a decision that has been met with criticism over the administration's authority to make such a change without Congress's approval.\n\nThe Treasury Department, in a statement to FoxNews.com, described the move as an exercise of administrative authority under the IRS code. The department claims it has \"longstanding\" authority to \"grant transition relief when implementing new legislation\" like the health care law.\n\nRepublicans, however, view this delay as a sign of potential problems with the health care law. Representative Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) has asked the Congressional Research Service to investigate the issue, stating, \"This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama administration can simply ignore the law when it's convenient for them.\"\n\nThe matter will be discussed further on Capitol Hill this week, with a hearing scheduled for July 10. Representative Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee, will lead the discussion, which will examine the administration's authority to change the law.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has described the move as \"another in a string of extra-legal actions taken\" by the Obama administration.\n\nRepublicans have raised several concerns regarding the delay, including the possibility of further delays and changes in the run-up to the January 1 launch of many of the law's major provisions. They have also questioned why the individual mandate, the requirement for individuals to buy health insurance, was not also delayed.\n\nIn response, the Treasury Department and White House explained that the delay was made after businesses complained about the reporting requirements. As the administration works to simplify the rules, they aim to give businesses more time to comply.\n\nMark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury, stated last week on the Treasury blog, \"We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively. We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so.\"",
    " Title: The Navy Yard Tragedy and the Ongoing Gun Control Debate: A Call for a Focus on Mental Health\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Navy Yard shooting has once again brought the gun control debate to the forefront of public discourse. However, the author argues that the tragedy will not rekindle the gun control debate in Congress due to the impracticality of gun control measures that would have prevented such incidents.\n\nThe Toomey-Manchin bill, which could have passed Congress unanimously, or the assault weapons ban, which could have barred the private purchase of handguns, would not have impeded the actions of the shooter, Aaron Alexis. The media's initial reports, based on erroneous information from law enforcement, incorrectly attributed the use of an AR-15 to Alexis, but it has since been confirmed that he used a shotgun in his rampage.\n\nThe media's response to the shooting, as well as the subsequent gun control debate, has been criticized for its sensationalism and lack of accuracy. Columnist Mike Lupica's scathing criticism of the AR-15, for instance, would have been misguided if an AR-15 had indeed been the murder weapon. Lupica's column, however, was not entirely without merit, as he correctly pointed out that we still do not know the extent to which Alexis used the shotgun.\n\nThe use of a shotgun by Alexis, a weapon that has been endorsed and promoted by Vice President Joe Biden, highlights the complexity of the gun control issue. Shotguns, like any other firearm, can be dangerous and are capable of causing significant harm, especially in permissive environments where few, if any, are armed.\n\nThe author argues that the focus on gun control, while well-intentioned, is misguided. The shooters in incidents such as the Navy Yard shooting, the Aurora theater shooting, and the Tucson shooting, were all deeply disturbed individuals whose actions were senseless and tragic. The common theme is not the type of gun used, but rather the mental state of the shooters.\n\nThe author calls for a shift in the focus of the debate from gun control to mental health. The current approach, which has been simplistic and instrumental, is likened to seeing a madman wearing a tinfoil hat and concluding that banning tinfoil would solve the problem.\n\nThe author suggests that if we had the same callous disregard for people suffering from Alzheimer's, they would be left to fend for themselves on the streets. It is argued that it should be easier to compel treatment for the mentally ill, as this may reduce the total amount of suffering from mental illness, and potentially reduce the occurrence of random shootings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author argues that the Navy Yard shooting demonstrates the essential sterility of the gun control debate and calls for a shift in focus to mental health. The author suggests that a more comprehensive approach to mental health care and treatment may be more effective in reducing the occurrence of senseless and tragic shootings.",
    " Title: U.S. Weighs Response as Syria Crosses \"Red Line\" on Chemical Weapons Use\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Syrian conflict has placed the White House in a delicate political position as President Bashar Assad is believed to have used chemical weapons, crossing a \"red line\" set by President Barack Obama. The U.S. intelligence community, based on physiological samples, has concluded that Assad's regime has employed the nerve agent sarin.\n\nIn a letter to Congress, the White House called for a comprehensive United Nations investigation and the establishment of all facts before deciding on a course of action. The administration has not yet committed to a military response, but has left open the possibility of all options being on the table.\n\nA White House official emphasized the need for a strong, firm, and evidentiary basis to inform the U.S.'s response and consultations with allies. The official also referenced the history of intelligence assessments, particularly those related to weapons of mass destruction, as a reason for caution and transparency in presenting information to the public.\n\nCongressional leaders, such as House Speaker John Boehner and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, have expressed concern that a delay in action could embolden Assad and lead to further atrocities. They have called for unified action to secure Syria's significant stockpile of chemical weapons and prevent larger-scale use.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon questioned the utility of red lines if they lack clear boundaries and meaningful consequences. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has stated that he will provide military options to the president when required, but also emphasized the need for a thorough investigation involving key partners and allies.\n\nThe situation in Syria remains fluid, with the international community closely watching the U.S.'s response to the reported use of chemical weapons. The White House has reiterated its commitment to holding those responsible accountable and ensuring the security of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Legislation Aims to Boost Wireless Networks in Rural America\n\nA pair of senators, Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), introduced a bipartisan bill on Tuesday that seeks to enhance wireless networks in underserved rural areas of America. The Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Viable Electromagnetic Spectrum (AIRWAVES) bill aims to open up spectrum space for commercial licensed and unlicensed use, with the hope that this will drive down wireless costs and increase accessibility.\n\nThe senators believe this legislation will bring increased broadband access to rural areas, which currently lag severely in terms of connectivity coverage rates and speed compared to urban areas. In a statement, Gardner said, \"This legislation offers innovative ways to avoid a spectrum crunch, pave the way for 5G service, and provide critical resources to rural America to continue rural buildout in unserved and underserved areas throughout Colorado and the country.\"\n\nDifferent bands of spectrum, or ranges of radio frequencies, are currently used to transmit audio, video, and data by various groups. Broadcasters, for example, transmit TV signals over spectrum bands, while wireless providers use them to distribute wireless broadband.\n\nThe bill has received praise from technology trade associations, who argue that it is needed to help rural communities. In a statement, the Information Technology Industry Council's (ITI) Vice President of Government Affairs Vince Jesaitis applauded the bill, stating that it would help the rollout of 5G high-speed wireless. Similarly, Kelly Cole, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs at CTIA, a trade association representing wireless companies, echoed this sentiment.\n\nHowever, some observers appreciate the bill's sentiment but have called for improvements as it moves through the legislative process. Michael Calabrese, director of New America's Wireless Future Program, commended the senators for proposing an ambitious spectrum pipeline bill but criticized the bill's focus on a one-time auction of spectrum for wireless broadband distribution. Calabrese suggested that opening other, additional underutilized bands of spectrum would be more effective.\n\nLawmakers and government officials in D.C. have made bridging the connectivity gap between rural and urban portions of America an increasingly large priority over the past year. Senators such as Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have advocated for deploying better broadband in rural portions of their states. At the Federal Communications Commission, Chairman Ajit Pai has pushed for solutions that would make it easier for broadband companies to increase access to internet in rural areas. Many companies wouldn't otherwise have a financial incentive to create the expensive infrastructure to bring broadband to such areas.",
    " Title: U.S. Accuses Iran of Attacking Oil Tankers in Gulf of Oman; Iran Denies Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Friday that Iran was responsible for an attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, a claim that Iran has denied. The U.S. Navy rushed to assist the stricken vessels, including one that was set ablaze Thursday by an explosion.\n\nDuring a 50-minute interview on Fox News, President Trump stated, \"It was them that did it.\" He also referred to Iran as \"a nation of terror.\" The president's comments followed the release of a video by the U.S. military that officials say shows Iran's Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIran has denied being involved, accusing the U.S. of waging an \"Iranophobic campaign\" against it. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists on Thursday that the U.S. assessment of Iran's involvement was based in part on intelligence, as well as the expertise needed for the operation.\n\nThe black-and-white footage, as well as still photographs released by the U.S. military's Central Command on Friday, appeared to show the limpet mine on the Kokuka Courageous. A Revolutionary Guard patrol boat pulled alongside the ship and removed the mine, Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban said.\n\nThe U.S. and the international community stand ready to defend our interests, including the freedom of navigation, Urban said. \"The U.S. has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests,\" Urban added.\n\nIran earlier denied involvement via a statement from its mission to the United Nations. The statement read, \"The U.S. economic war and terrorism against the Iranian people as well as its massive military presence in the region have been and continue to be the main sources of insecurity and instability in the wider Persian Gulf region and the most significant threat to its peace and security.\"\n\nThe debate over who was responsible for the attack continues, with the U.S. and its allies accusing Iran, while Iran denies any involvement. The incident has escalated tensions in the Middle East, with Iran appearing poised to break the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Reiterate Opposing Positions on Taxes Ahead of Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week that saw signs of potential compromise, both President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner restated their contrasting positions on taxes over the weekend, with the president advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy and Boehner calling for tax code reform and lower overall tax rates.\n\nPresident Obama, who has extended invitations to Mr. Boehner and other congressional leaders for a meeting at the White House next week to discuss ways to avoid the \"fiscal cliff,\" a series of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to take effect at the end of the year, emphasized that part of the solution will involve increased taxes for individuals earning more than $250,000.\n\n\"If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue \u2013 and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes,\" the president said in his weekly Internet and radio address. \"That's how we did it when Bill Clinton was president. And that's the only way we can afford to invest in education and job training and manufacturing \u2013 all the ingredients of a strong middle class and a strong economy.\"\n\nThe president reaffirmed his belief, expressed a day earlier, that Tuesday's election, which saw the re-election of the Democratic incumbent and an increase in Democratic representation in the Senate and the House, signaled a mandate for \"action.\"\n\n\"On Tuesday, America went to the polls. And the message you sent was clear: You voted for action, not politics as usual,\" he said. \"That's why I've invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week, so we can start to build consensus around challenges we can only solve together.\"\n\n\"This is even more important because at the end of this year, we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay down our deficit \u2013 decisions that will have a huge impact on the economy and the middle class, now and in the future,\" he added.\n\nPart of the \"fiscal cliff\" facing the U.S. economy involves the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would result in a broad-based tax increase in 2013. The president urged Republicans to take action to prevent this scenario.\n\n\"We need a majority in Congress to listen \u2013 and they should start by making sure taxes don't go up on the 98 percent of Americans making under $250,000 a year starting January 1. This is something we all agree on,\" the president said.\n\nMr. Boehner has expressed concern that tax increases would plunge the American economy back into a double-dip recession.\n\n\"Instead of raising tax rates on the American people and accepting the damage it will do to our economy, let's start to actually solve the problem. Let's focus on tax reform that closes special interest loopholes and lowers tax rates,\" the Ohio Republican said in the GOP's weekly address.\n\n\"If there was a mandate in this election, it was a mandate to work together to do what's in the best interest of our country,\" Mr. Boehner and Republicans support extending the Bush tax cuts. The White House supports the extension for income under $250,000, but seeks higher rates for income above that level.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Drops Defamation Lawsuit Against Hillary Clinton\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has withdrawn her defamation lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to a report by Reuters. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in January, sought at least $50 million in damages for remarks Clinton made in October 2019, implying that Gabbard was a \"Russian asset\" and \"groomed\" by the Kremlin.\n\nGabbard and her campaign filed a notice of dismissal, stating they \"remain certain of the action's legal merit\" but wished to focus on the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and \"defeating Donald Trump in 2020, rather than righting the wrongs here.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that Clinton \"carelessly and recklessly impugned\" Gabbard's reputation during an interview on the \"Campaign HQ\" podcast with host David Plouffe. In the interview, Clinton suggested that Moscow was \"grooming\" Gabbard for a spoiler campaign.\n\nSpecifically, Clinton stated that Tulsi Gabbard, an Army National Guard officer and U.S. Congresswoman, was a \"Russian asset.\" The suit alleged that these false assertions were made \"in a deliberate attempt to derail Tulsi's presidential campaign.\"\n\nThe interview in question took place in October 2019. During it, Clinton indicated that Moscow was \"grooming\" Gabbard for a third-party campaign. When asked if she was referring to Gabbard, Clinton responded, \"If the nesting doll fits.\" Clinton added that the attempt to get a Democrat to run third party would happen only if the Russians did not use 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein to accomplish the same thing.\n\n\"And that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she's also a Russian asset,\" Clinton said. \"Yeah, she's a Russian asset\u2014I mean, totally.\"\n\nThe dismissal of the lawsuit marks a significant development in the ongoing political drama between the two Democratic politicians. Gabbard, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, has been a vocal critic of Clinton, who has long been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. The lawsuit and subsequent dismissal have raised questions about the nature and extent of political rivalries within the party.",
    " Title: Investigative Report: Planned Parenthood Under Scrutiny for Double Billing, Obamacare Navigation, and Sex Education Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of sexual and reproductive health services, is facing scrutiny on multiple fronts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is currently investigating the organization for double billing Medicaid, and it has been appointed as an 'Obamacare Navigator,' a role that critics argue could potentially conflict with its primary services.\n\nThe GAO investigation, which is ongoing, alleges that Planned Parenthood has been double billing Medicaid for services provided. This comes at a time when Planned Parenthood is also being paid over $650,000 as Obamacare Navigators to help individuals sign up for the Affordable Care Act. This arrangement has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Planned Parenthood stands to benefit financially from the enrollment of individuals in Obamacare.\n\nIn a move to shed light on Planned Parenthood's practices, Students for Life of America is launching the Planned Parenthood Project in over 40 schools across 20 states. The aim is to educate students about Planned Parenthood's true intentions and the realities of its services.\n\nOne of the most striking revelations from the campus tours so far has been the gratitude expressed by pro-choice students for the exposure of the truth. The crux of the issue lies in the perception that Planned Parenthood targets and uses individuals, a business model that is increasingly being questioned.\n\nA significant point of contention is Planned Parenthood's comprehensive sex education programs, which are taught in many school districts and advocate for sex education from as young as two years old. Critics argue that this education promotes promiscuity, encourages the use of potentially harmful contraceptives, and normalizes inappropriate relationships and abortion.\n\nThe contraceptives offered by Planned Parenthood to sexually active teens and young adults have been found to be of low quality. Consumer Reports has rated Planned Parenthood condoms as the lowest quality, meaning they will fail more times to prevent pregnancy than other condoms. Furthermore, the hormonal contraception they promote has been labeled by the World Health Organization as a Type 1 Carcinogen, a category that includes cigarettes and asbestos, indicating it causes cancer.\n\nGiven the high rates of sexual activity among young people, many of whom are using Planned Parenthood's contraceptives, the organization becomes a primary point of contact when they contract a sexually transmitted disease (STD). With over two out of five individuals under 25 contracting an STD, Planned Parenthood's role in this cycle is significant.\n\nWhen these individuals become pregnant, they often return to Planned Parenthood for abortion services. Planned Parenthood performs an average of 915 abortions per day, making abortion 92% of their pregnancy services. These abortions generated revenue of $150 million last year alone.\n\nOptions counseling, a service Planned Parenthood offers, is often criticized for being biased towards abortion. Former Planned Parenthood employees have admitted that their options counseling is primarily about getting women to have abortions to meet mandated abortion quotas. This allegation is supported by Planned Parenthood's own Annual Report, which shows they perform 145 abortions for every 1 adoption referral.\n\nGiven Planned Parenthood's focus on abortion, it is unsurprising that they would be eager to promote Obamacare. By increasing the number of women enrolled in Obamacare, Planned Parenthood stands to benefit financially from servicing these women. It is important to note that Planned Parenthood receives over $542 million in taxpayer funds annually and boasts a profit of over $100 million.\n\nIn conclusion, Planned Parenthood's practices are under intense scrutiny, with investigations into double billing Medicaid, concerns about its role as an Obamacare Navigator, and criticisms of its comprehensive sex education programs and contraceptive offerings. As the nation's largest abortion vendor, Planned Parenthood's primary focus on abortion, its financial reliance on taxpayer funds, and its role in the sexual health of young people warrant further examination and discussion.",
    " Title: The Emergence of a Self-Reinforcing Media Bubble in the GOP: A Generational Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nA generational divide is emerging within the Republican Party, with younger operatives and ideologues calling for a break from a self-imposed media cocoon that they believe is intellectually stifling and politically self-defeating. The call comes after the recent electoral losses, with some blaming the party's fundamental problem on this media cocoon rather than external factors such as changing demographics or voter turnout systems.\n\nThe analogy to Pauline Kael, the New Yorker movie critic who famously stated that she knew only one person who voted for Richard M. Nixon in 1972, is being drawn by these young Republicans. They fear that they, like Kael, are the ones in a hermetically sealed bubble, not geographically but ideologically, where their views are reinforced and an alternate reality is reflected.\n\nRoss Douthat, a 32-year-old New York Times columnist, described the right as suffering from an \"era of on-demand reality.\" Ben Domenech, a 30-year-old think tanker and writer, referred to it as \"an era of on-demand reality.\" A prominent Republican from the George W. Bush era lamented, \"We have become what the left was in the '70s \u2014 insular.\"\n\nIn this conservative media bubble, Rasmussen polls are considered gospel, the Benghazi controversy is equated with Watergate, Fox News, talk radio, and the Drudge Report are the most powerful forces, and Dick Morris is considered a political seer. Even after a convincing Obama win, some far-right conservatives still believe in voter fraud and missing military ballots, refusing to confront a reality they'd rather not acknowledge.\n\nThe Fox News-talk radio-Drudge Report axis is the most powerful force in the conservative media cocoon, but technology has made these outlets merely the most popular destinations in the choose-your-own-adventure news world. Consumers are more empowered than ever, with Facebook and Twitter feeds, email in-boxes, and the internet, which allows them to selectively consume news that reinforces their views.\n\nTrey Grayson, the former Kentucky secretary of state and the current head of Harvard's Institute of Politics, noted, \"The Internet amplifies talk radio and cable news, and provides distribution for other sources like Newsmax. Then your friends, who usually agree with you, disseminate the same stories on Facebook and Twitter. And you assume that everyone agrees with you!\"\n\nGrayson further explained, \"It's very striking for me living in Cambridge now. My Facebook feed, which is full of mostly conservatives from Kentucky, contains very different links to articles or topics than what I see in Cambridge. It is sort of the reverse up here. They don't understand how anyone would eat Chick-fil-A, watch college sports or hold pro-life views.\"\n\nThis self-reinforcing media bubble is a concern for many within the Republican Party, as they look to regroup and rebuild after the recent electoral losses. The question remains whether the party will heed the call of its younger members and break free from this cocoon, or if it will continue to drive off the political cliff, refusing to face a reality it'd rather not confront.",
    " Title: U.S. Settles Decades-Old Dispute with Iran, Sends $400 Million in Cash as Part of Prisoner Release\n\nThe Obama administration secretly airlifted $400 million in cash to Iran in January to settle a decades-old legal dispute as the Iranians were releasing four American prisoners detained by Tehran, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The money was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the administration reached with Iran to resolve a 37-year-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.\n\nThe cash was flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, with wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs, and other currency. The money was not disclosed by President Obama until January, when he referred to the resolution of the arms dispute by saying that \"with the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest denied that the payment was a ransom for the release of the prisoners, saying that such a move would violate U.S. policy. He defended the deal by stating that the money was Iranian money and had been paid into a U.S. account in 1979 as part of a deal to buy military equipment that never took place because of the overthrow of the shah.\n\nThe four prisoners included two Iranian-Americans arrested by Iranian security services during Obama's first term, the detention of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, in 2014 on espionage charges, and the arrest in 2015 of a fourth Iranian-American. The newspaper said U.S. and European officials would not disclose exactly when the cash-laden plane landed in Tehran, but a report by the Iranian Tasnim news agency, with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, said it arrived at Mehrabad airport on the same day the Americans left the country.\n\nIn Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Wednesday denied the payment amounted to ransom for hostages, saying that the timing of the various deals and prisoner release overlapped because the multiple agreements with Iran \"came to a head at the same time\" as parallel negotiations were wrapped up. He also noted that the bulk of the money \"has been going to shoring up their economic weakness,\" while acknowledging that \"it's possible that some of the money\" has been used by Iran to support Hezbollah and the regime of President Bashar Assad in Syria.",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate: Biden and Ryan Prepare for High-Stakes Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, the focus shifts to the vice presidential candidates, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, who will face off in a highly anticipated debate on Thursday at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. The stakes are high for both candidates, with Biden under pressure to help President Obama regain momentum after a lackluster performance in the first presidential debate.\n\nBiden, who is known for his gaffes, is aware of the importance of his performance in the debate, as Obama's poor showing in the first debate has erased his lead in several key battleground states. While Biden does not have the burden of looking presidential, he must strike a balance between being assertive and avoiding any unguarded moments that could remind viewers of John McCain's grumpy 2008 debate performance against Obama.\n\nBiden has been preparing for the debate by scrutinizing videos of Ryan's speeches and interviews, holding mock debates with Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen and senior adviser David Axelrod. Ryan, on the other hand, has been preparing with former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who played the role of Biden in mock debates.\n\nBiden and Ryan are expected to focus on key issues such as taxes, spending, and Medicare during the debate. Biden is likely to try to force Ryan to defend Romney's proposals on taxes and spending, and seize any opportunity to tie Romney to Ryan's Medicare plan, which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it.\n\nThe Medicare issue has become a major point of contention in the campaign, with polls giving Obama the edge when it comes to handling Medicare. In early September, Biden accused the Romney-Ryan ticket of turning Medicare into \"voucher-care,\" while Ryan has not tried to run away from the Medicare issue, memorably joining his 78-year-old mother, Betty Douglas, when he delivered a speech on Medicare reform.\n\nThe vice presidential debate is expected to be a lively and intense affair, with both candidates eager to make their case to voters. The outcome of the debate could have a significant impact on the election, as the vice presidential debate has the potential to change the course of the election, unlike in previous years.",
    " Title: \"Hillary Clinton's Struggle in Iowa: A Shift in the Democratic Landscape and the Rise of Bernie Sanders\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, has once again underperformed in the Iowa caucuses, a development that has left her campaign in a precarious position. This marks the second time in eight years that Clinton has failed to secure a significant victory in the state, a setback that has been a recurring theme in her presidential aspirations.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, often criticized for their idiosyncratic nature, have once more proven to be a challenging terrain for Clinton. In 2008, she came in third, a precursor of what was to follow. On Monday, she watched as Bernie Sanders, a relative unknown a year ago, fought her to a standstill, erasing the traces of inevitability that still clung to her campaign.\n\nFor Sanders, the results in Iowa culminate a remarkable year. Regardless of the outcome moving forward, he has achieved a gravity-defying political feat, mobilizing a groundswell of grassroots support and defining the contours of the primary race more than Clinton has. This was evident in Clinton's speech, where she adopted Sanders' rhetoric, declaring that \"the status quo is not good enough.\" Sanders, in turn, was jubilant as he addressed his ecstatic crowd on the night of his political triumph.\n\nThe future of the campaign remains uncertain. Sanders holds a commanding lead in New Hampshire, a state that seems difficult for him to relinquish. After that, the campaign moves on to Nevada and South Carolina, where the demographic profile of the electorate shifts significantly. Clinton currently leads in both states, but polls can change. It seems likely that Sanders will ultimately be overtaken by Clinton, but it is clear that the race will take much longer than most anticipated.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is why Clinton has found herself in this predicament. To truly understand this, we must look beyond the narrow confines of party politics. Sanders' success is not solely a product of his political acumen or his ability to captivate the electorate; he is the beneficiary of broader societal shifts. The Democratic Party has been moving left, not because of Bernie Sanders, but because of movements such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, women's rights activists, climate change activists, immigrants' rights activists, and LGBT activists. These movements have pushed the boundaries, forced the discourse to expand, and their influence has trickled down into the political process. There were people waiting for Bernie Sanders. The best idea he ever had was to show up.",
    " Title: Study Challenges Stereotype: Liberals and Conservatives Both Resist Science Disagreeing with Them\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study from Ohio State University, titled \"The Partisan Brain: How Dissonant Science Messages Lead Conservatives and Liberals to (Dis) Trust Science,\" to be published in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science next month, has found that both liberals and conservatives exhibit similar tendencies in rejecting science when it contradicts their political beliefs, according to The Christian Post.\n\nThe researchers, Erik Nesbit, R. Kelly Garrett, and Kathryn Cooper, examined audience reactions to both conservative-dissonant and liberal-dissonant science messages and their impact on trust in the scientific community. Their results suggest that both liberals and conservatives react negatively to dissonant science communication, leading to diminished trust in the scientific community.\n\nThe study involved 1,518 adults, who were divided into three groups. The first group, identified as conservatives, was asked questions about scientific research on climate change and evolution that clashed with their political leanings. The second group, labeled as liberals, were asked similar questions on fracking and nuclear power that went against standard liberal political beliefs. The third group was asked more politically neutral questions.\n\nAccording to The Christian Post, \"Both liberals and conservatives were less likely to trust the scientific results in the groups where those results were out of sync with their own ideology.\"\n\nWhile conservatives have often been stereotyped, particularly by liberals, for being less likely to accept scientific findings that contradict their political prejudices, the Christian Post noted, \"The findings challenge previous research reporting that the brains of conservatives are different than the brains of liberals and are fundamentally less capable of rationally processing scientific evidence.\"\n\nThe researchers state, \"There has been deepening concern about political polarization in public attitudes toward the scientific community. The 'intrinsic thesis' attributes this polarization to psychological deficiencies among conservatives as compared to liberals.\" However, their findings \"link to the larger debate about political polarization of science and implications for science communicators.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Gun Control Agenda: A Look at the Policy Proposals and Challenges Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Newtown, President Barack Obama has called for action, sparking hope among anti-gun advocates. However, the president has yet to provide specific details on his gun control agenda.\n\nOn Monday, the White House continued to evade specifics, with press secretary Jay Carney stating that there was no \"specific agenda to announce.\" Yet, ideas are already circulating, with Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) expressing openness to new gun restrictions.\n\nOne of the most prominent policy proposals comes from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has been working on an updated version of the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. Feinstein plans to introduce the bill on the first day of the new Senate session. President Obama has expressed support for an assault weapons ban, and Feinstein hopes to secure his backing.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner has expressed sympathy for the Newtown victims but has not mentioned any legislative action. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a supporter of an assault weapons ban, is skeptical about the prospects of significant change.\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged that individual government actions may not prevent every senseless act of violence, but he will need legislation to achieve any major action on the issue. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that his organization is in regular contact with the White House and is encouraged by Obama's message. Gross believes that to have a significant impact, policy changes are necessary, and executive action alone may not be sufficient.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Newtown tragedy, the debate on gun control continues, with both proponents and opponents awaiting the president's next move.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Divide on Healthcare Policies Among Democratic Presidential Candidates and American Public\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by CNN has shown a shift in the Democratic primary race, with former Vice President Joe Biden's lead narrowing to single digits over three competitors, including a surging Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and a fading Bernie Sanders. The poll, however, is an outlier compared to two other surveys that show Biden in decline, but not by as dramatic a margin.\n\nThe poll, released on Monday, found that 58% of Americans oppose giving government-backed healthcare to illegal immigrants, while 38% support the idea. This contrasts with the responses of all ten Democratic candidates who participated in the second night of the debate, as ten out of ten raised their hands in the affirmative when asked last Thursday evening by NBC moderators if they would cover illegal immigrants in their healthcare plans.\n\nThe poll also revealed that only about one-in-five voters favor bills that would make private insurance coverage illegal, a proposal endorsed by nearly half of House Democrats and most of the US Senators running for president. This would cancel and eliminate the plans of roughly 180 million Americans. Even among Democratic voters, a large majority of whom want a new national healthcare program, 'BernieCare' is unpopular.\n\nThe poll results highlight the stark divide between the Democratic candidates' views and the majority of the American public on healthcare policies. Candidates like Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren have all expressed support for a single-payer government system, with only 21% supporting the complete replacement of private health insurance with a national program.\n\nThe poll also showed that only 25% of Americans support the idea of eliminating private insurance coverage and forcing the entire population into a single-payer government system, while 71% oppose such a move. The results suggest that the Democratic candidates' proposals for healthcare reform may face significant opposition from the American public.\n\nThe poll's findings come as the Democratic primary race heats up, with the first round of debates set to take place later this month. The results could influence the direction of the debate and the strategies of the candidates as they seek to appeal to a diverse and increasingly polarized electorate.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Congress to Avert Sequester Cuts, Renews Call for Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed call to action, President Barack Obama on Tuesday urged Congress to halt the next round of $85 billion in budget cuts, set to take effect next month, and replace the automatic spending \"sequesters\" with a combination of smaller cuts and tax increases. The President's proposal, which revives proposals he has made in the past to end tax breaks and lower projected increases in healthcare spending, has reignited the spending debate that has dominated Washington for the past two years.\n\nAt a time when many top Republicans have advocated for the cuts to take effect, Mr. Obama's call for a different approach renews the battle over spending. The President suggested a desire for another significant tax reform targeting the wealthy, involving the elimination of deductions and loopholes, but also emphasized the need for Congress to avert the sequester, which he described as an \"avoidable self-inflicted economic wound.\"\n\n\"If they can't get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect, then I believe they should at least pass a smaller package,\" said the President. \"There is no reason that the jobs of thousands of Americans who work in national security or education or clean energy\u2014not to mention the growth of the entire economy\u2014should be put in jeopardy.\"\n\nThe President's offer, however, has already faced rejection from Republicans. House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, issued a statement saying it was the President who came up with the sequester idea. He also stated that House Republicans have passed two bills to avert the sequesters, so the President must lay out his own specific plan.\n\n\"President Obama first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law,\" said Speaker Boehner. \"Republicans have twice voted to replace these arbitrary cuts with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect our national defense.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, also rebuked Mr. Obama for lecturing Congress about the need to avoid the cuts he proposed. \"If Democrats have ideas for smarter cuts, they should bring them up for debate,\" he said. \"But the American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the President signed into law.\"\n\nThe White House first came up with the idea of the arbitrary, across-the-board spending cuts during budget talks in summer 2011 as a way to pressure Democrats and Republicans in Congress into coming up with their own spending cut plan to reduce the deficit over the next decade. However, partisan Washington gridlock quickly took hold, and a supercommittee of lawmakers tasked with coming up with a plan to find alternative spending cuts to replace the sequester failed to reach a deal after negotiating for months.\n\nAs the country braces for the cuts to kick in and Washington to tumble off the fiscal cliff on January 1, lawmakers struck a last-minute deal that shifted the first two months of cuts into future spending bills and replaced the rest with an increase in the way retirement accounts are taxed. The deal postponed another $85 billion in cuts to March 1\u2014a way to buy more time to find alternative sources of revenue.\n\nThe Pentagon, in recent weeks, has grown increasingly pessimistic about the chances of avoiding the cuts, and the branches of the military have issued memos outlining what programs and sections would be hit hardest. Washington think tanks and policy centers have warned repeatedly of the havoc that the cuts could wreak on the economy. The Bipartisan Policy Center has estimated that 1 million jobs could be lost this year and next as a direct result of the spending cuts, and defense industry analysts say that number could rise to 2 million this year alone.\n\nThe President made his plea as Senate Democrats were meeting in Annapolis for their annual retreat. Mr. Obama is scheduled to address the group Wednesday.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Criticizes Government Spending, Calls for Audit of Pentagon Budget\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a radio interview with John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) criticized lawmakers for what he described as runaway government spending and wasteful expenditures. The senator, known for his fiscal conservatism, pointed to a specific example of $700,000 spent on studying Neil Armstrong's words upon landing on the moon.\n\n\"I can give you a quick example of some of the stuff we spend money on,\" Paul said. \"We spent $700,000 last year studying what Neil Armstrong said when he landed on the moon.\"\n\n\"Remember, he said 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' Well, some idiot in government took $700,000 of taxpayer money and wanted to know whether he said 'one small step for man' or 'one small step for a man.' So that's the kind of stuff your government is spending money on,\" he added.\n\nPaul also criticized the Pentagon's budget, stating that he has been advocating for an audit of the Defense Department before any additional funds are allocated.\n\n\"Before we give them more money, make them account for the money they're already spending,\" Paul said.\n\nSen. Paul, who is considered one of the Senate's most ardent budget hawks, has previously criticized his own party for their spending habits, particularly under the Trump administration.\n\nEarlier this week, Paul forced a brief government shutdown by delaying a vote on a sweeping spending bill with a lengthy speech on the Senate floor. The bill, which included increases in both domestic and military spending, eventually passed hours later and was signed by President Trump, ending the shutdown.",
    " Title: Liberal Response to Kavanaugh Nomination: A New Normal of Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the nomination of conservative appellate court judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, President Trump has followed a common practice. However, the liberal response to this nomination has been anything but normal, or rather, it is the new normal of responding to everything the Trump administration does as if it were truly alarming.\n\nThe nomination of Kavanaugh, a consummate conservative, was a normal moment in the political landscape, with a Republican president filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Yet, the liberal response, from Hollywood to New York to Washington, was filled with hyperbolic statements, suggesting that the nomination could lead to the end of democracy, the imminent rise of an American dictatorship, or the destruction of the planet.\n\nThe problem with such severe reactions is not that they lack justification. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's refusal to allow hearings or a vote on Barack Obama's nominee to succeed Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court was indeed an egregious act of norm violation. However, the liberal response to the Kavanaugh announcement has not primarily focused on the injustice of McConnell's Republican power grab and its consequences on the number of Supreme Court slots Trump will get to fill. Instead, it has focused on the supposed extremism of Kavanaugh's legal and constitutional views.\n\nThis would seem to imply that the mainstream Democratic position has arrived at the point where it considers not just President Trump's most egregious statements, behavior, and policies to be a truly alarming threat to liberal democracy in America\u2014but longstanding, mainstream Republican positions an alarming threat, too.\n\nThe first is the problem of crying wolf. Democrats have a long history of amping up the insults about Republican presidents and would-be presidents. Reagan was a doofus. Bush was a fascist. Romney was a racist. (Of course, Republicans do the same thing with Democrats, labeling a moderate, incrementalist progressive like Barack Obama a radical and a socialist.) Now that the country confronts a president who actually does display some affinity for fascism and who actually does pursue policies rooted in racism, Democrats are left in the position of saying, \"But this time we're serious!\" Their case will not be strengthened by demonizing a conventional conservative jurist like Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nUnless Democrats really do believe their own five-alarm hyperbole and now actually consider a conventional conservative jurist like Brett Kavanaugh to be a serious threat to the republic. That is the second and far more ominous danger\u2014whether or not it's true.\n\nIf that dire assessment of the peril posed by supposedly normal Republican ideas and goals is valid, then it means that one of the country's two parties poses something like an existential threat to our form of government\u2014somewhat like the threat that an aggressive and potentially fatal form of cancer poses to the human body from the inside. On this view, Republicans are less a perfectly legitimate rival for power than a civic menace\u2014a formidable enemy that needs to be decisively defeated. It's hard to see how the ordinary back-and-forth of democratic politics, with two or more parties trading or sharing power, can be allowed to continue when the prospect of the other side's political victory could precipitate the end of the system itself.\n\nIf Republicans really do pose such a threat, that's very bad. But it's also bad if Democrats merely think and act as if it's true, since it implies that they now believe that the only way to be a \"good American\" is to\u2026 be a Democrat. The problem with Kavanaugh, after all, is not Trump's corruption or the gratuitous cruelty and ineptitude of his administration. The problem with Kavanaugh is the agenda of his party and its ideology going back decades.\n\nDo Democrats really intend to suggest that Americans need to agree with them or else risk subverting American democracy as such? If so, they should be clear about it\u2014and honest with themselves about what it implies, which is that what was formerly considered perfectly normal (the ordinary give-and-take of democratic politics) has now become a luxury the country can no longer afford. That would signal the end of normal politics in America\u2014and constitute a genuine crisis of American democracy. I have a hard time imagining anything more alarming than that.",
    " Title: Florida's Electoral Landscape Shifts as 1.4 Million Felons Regain Voting Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe state of Florida has experienced a significant political shift following the passage of Amendment 4, which grants voting rights to approximately 1.4 million convicted felons who have completed their sentences. The measure, approved by nearly two-thirds of Floridians on Tuesday, excludes those convicted of murder and sex crimes.\n\nThis expansion of eligible voters in Florida, a state where elections are often decided by a narrow margin, has sparked a flurry of voter registration efforts among eligible felons. The exact political impact of this new pool of voters remains uncertain, according to multiple experts and activists. It is also unclear how many felons will actually register to vote.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic candidates overwhelmingly endorsed Amendment 4, making it a key part of their campaigns. Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott, largely opposed it. The close margins in the races of former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) against their respective Republican opponents suggest that the restoration of voting rights could potentially influence future elections.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has indicated that an implementing bill may be necessary for the Legislature to clarify the process of restoring voting rights. DeSantis stated that guidance is needed to ensure that no sex offenders \"fall through the cracks.\"\n\n\"There's going to need to be guidance for that,\" DeSantis told reporters. \"It's not delaying it. The people spoke on it. It's going to be implemented, but I think it needs to be implemented the way people intended, and I don't think that they wanted to see any sex offenders fall through the cracks.\"\n\nThe implementation of Amendment 4 and its political implications remain to be seen, but the potential for change in Florida's electoral landscape is significant.",
    " Title: South Carolina Primaries: Trump and Clinton Maintain Leads as Competitors Battle for Second Place\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the South Carolina primaries approach, both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are intensifying their efforts in the Palmetto State. The Republican primary is set for February 20, followed by the Democratic primary on February 27.\n\nIn the latest polls, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the clear frontrunners. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls shows Trump with 36 percent support, compared to about 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas. Trump is aiming to build on his momentum from his New Hampshire win.\n\nTrump's victory in New Hampshire was remarkable due to its breadth. He won across demographic groups, capturing both men and women, city and countryside dwellers, voters of all ages, and both conservative and moderate voters.\n\nCruz, however, believes he is the main challenger to Trump. \"One of the most important conclusions coming out of these first two states is that the candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me,\" Cruz stated.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush currently hold third and fourth place, respectively, in the Republican race. In a significant development, two GOP candidates, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have recently dropped out of the race following weak performances in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Democratic race is equally competitive. Bernie Sanders' victory in New Hampshire was decisive, but Clinton leads him in South Carolina, with 62 percent compared to his 32 percent. Clinton has acknowledged the need to reach out to young voters, particularly women, who supported Sanders in large numbers in New Hampshire.\n\n\"You may not support me, but I support you,\" Clinton said in her efforts to connect with young voters. Sanders, too, is targeting this demographic, as well as the minority vote. Meanwhile, Clinton has received the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC.\n\nIf the polls are accurate, Clinton and Trump should easily win in South Carolina. However, the other candidates are fighting hard to close the gap, and March, with more than 20 states casting their votes, is fast approaching.",
    " Title: Sanders Regains Momentum in Democratic Primary Race, Narrowly Trails Biden in National Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has regained momentum in the Democratic primary race, narrowly trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls. Sanders, who had a heart attack two months ago and trailed Senator Elizabeth Warren in the polls, has been gaining ground since then, demonstrating the resilience of his left-wing campaign.\n\nAt a beachside rally in Los Angeles last Saturday, Sanders addressed a crowd of thousands, marking the end of a six-day swing through California, the most populous state in the U.S. Sanders emphasized his commitment to a political revolution and transforming the country, stating, \"Our campaign is not only about defeating [Donald] Trump, our campaign is about a political revolution, it is about transforming this country, it is about creating a government and an economy that works for all people and not just the 1%.\"\n\nThe resurgence of Sanders' campaign was hard to imagine just two months ago, as he recovered from a heart attack and Warren surged past him in the polls. However, since then, Warren has slipped back, and Sanders has regained lost ground, leading some in the Democratic party to question whether Sanders could actually win the nomination for a second time.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Warren was 12 points ahead of Sanders and virtually tied with Biden in early October, shortly after Sanders' heart attack. Since then, Warren has been slipping, and Sanders has pulled ahead of her. The polling average now shows Sanders in second place, averaging 19.3% in national polls, putting him eight points behind Biden and four points ahead of Warren.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to Barack Obama, told Politico, \"I believe people should take him very seriously. He has a very good shot of winning Iowa, a very good shot of winning New Hampshire, and other than Joe Biden, the best shot of winning Nevada. He could build a real head of steam heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.\"\n\nSanders seems to be learning from some of the pitfalls of his 2016 campaign, particularly his poor performance in racially diverse states like Nevada and South Carolina. This time around, Sanders has made significant efforts to reach out to voters of color, specifically Latinos. Polls show Sanders is the top choice among Latino voters, and the candidate held a Spanish-language town hall on Sunday in Las Vegas, Nevada, alongside Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This outreach could prove critical in states like California, where Latinos make up about 40% of the population, and where the state awards nearly 500 delegates, about 10 times as many as the first caucus state of Iowa.\n\nHowever, Sanders' greatest asset - a core of solid support - is also shared by Biden. The Democratic presidential primary has proven surprisingly stable so far, with Biden continuing to lead even as candidates previously considered potential frontrunners, such as Kamala Harris and Beto O'Rourke, have exited the race. Like Sanders, Biden has a solid base of supporters who have not abandoned him, despite negative coverage in recent months. The Vermont senator would need the dynamics of the primary to shift in some significant way to pull ahead of the former vice-president.\n\nThis is one reason why many centrist Democrats remain unconvinced Sanders can form a winning Democratic coalition. Matt Bennett, the co-founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, told Politico, \"He can't win the nomination.\" Bennett and some of Sanders' other critics have argued the senator's ceiling of support is too low to ultimately defeat his primary opponents.\n\nHowever, Sanders' 2016 campaign proved that he thrives on low expectations. Many Washington insiders scoffed at Sanders' first White House bid, until he fought Clinton to a draw in Iowa and scored a decisive victory in New Hampshire. Today, Sanders is offering the same message that he did four years ago: \"Don't underestimate me.\"",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Boasts Higher Representation of People of Color in Senior Staff Compared to Trump's\n\nArticle:\n\nThe presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has a higher representation of people of color among his senior staff compared to President Donald Trump's reelection effort, according to data on staff diversity.\n\nThirty-five percent of Biden's full-time staff are people of color, the campaign revealed to a media outlet on Sunday. Among senior staff, 36 percent are people of color, according to the campaign. By contrast, 25 percent of President Trump's campaign's senior staff are people of color, the campaign told the same media outlet. The Trump campaign did not release information regarding the percentage of people of color on its full-time staff.\n\nBoth campaigns also reported a small majority of their full-time and senior staff are women. The Biden campaign stated that 53 percent of full-time staff and 58 percent of senior staff identify as female. According to the Trump campaign, 52 percent of full-time staff are women and 56 percent of senior staff are women.\n\nSenior staff, as defined by the Biden campaign, includes department heads, senior advisors, deputy campaign managers, and senior consultants who spend the majority of their time on the campaign. The Biden campaign is still in the process of hiring key leaders across the campaign.\n\nBiden's campaign released the data after being pressed about the information during a town hall focusing on issues affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, according to CNN. \"We'll release the diversity data today when we get off this call. We'll call you, and the fact of the matter is we have a very diverse staff. And we have a diverse staff that goes across the board,\" Biden reportedly said during the town hall.",
    " Title: Trump's Immigration Policy Remains Unclear as Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway Says Position on Deportation is \"To Be Determined\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The position of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the forced deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the US remains unclear, with his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, stating on Sunday that it is \"to be determined.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union,\" Conway responded to reports about what was said in a meeting Trump held on Saturday with a Hispanic advisory council. Sources in the room told BuzzFeed that Trump spoke about a \"humane and efficient\" way to work with undocumented immigrants in the country currently, which was characterized by BuzzFeed as a way to legalize some and let them stay.\n\nConway disputed that Trump presented a reversal of his position in the meeting. \"So what Donald Trump said yesterday in that meeting... varied little from what he has said publicly,\" Conway said. \"What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for jobs, and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us.\"\n\nWhen asked by repeated questioning about a deportation task force, Conway responded, \"to be determined.\"\n\nTrump himself told Fox News on Monday that he is not \"flip-flopping\" on the issue. \"We want to come up with a fair but firm process. Fair but firm,\" Trump said. He did not provide any specifics or elaborate on his position further.\n\nBeyond immigration, Conway also reiterated the long-standing Trump campaign position that the candidate will not release his tax returns, saying they are under audit. She also addressed a 2005 comment she made about Hillary Clinton, and whether she was disparaging spouses who reconcile after cheating.\n\nConway said she was not making a statement about Clinton's marriage, and that the question is about Clinton's leadership and her ability to stand up to enemies in the world.\n\nConway also said former Fox News chief Roger Ailes does not have a \"formal or informal\" advisory role with the campaign, but said Ailes and Trump speak and are \"old friends.\"\n\nAs Trump's new campaign manager, Conway said she would assess the situation, adding the Republican National Committee would be continuing to help. \"We're working closely with the RNC, whether it's political, data, fundraising,\" Conway said. \"We've got a great relationship with Chairman (Reince) Priebus. Talk to him daily now. And we at the campaign are going to expect Sean Spicer, the director of communications and the chief strategist at the RNC to spend more time with us.\"\n\nConway did not say Spicer was formally joining the campaign. She also addressed Trump's statement last week - for the first time - that he has \"regrets\" over certain, but unspecified, statements throughout his campaign. Conway was pressed on whether Trump was specifically apologizing for high-profile controversial statements, including disparaging Arizona Sen. John McCain's military record and comments he made about a Gold Star family that spoke at the Democratic convention.\n\nConway demurred on who specifically Trump was expressing regret to, and said he has not made apology calls to individuals. \"He's expressed his regret publicly and said, 'If I have caused you personal pain - that can include me, that can include you' - that he regrets that,\" Conway said.",
    " Title: Tea Party Members Accuse Federal Government of Overreach, Cite IRS Scandal, AP Seizure, and Benghazi\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) \u2013 In a rally on Capitol Hill Thursday, members of the tea party expressed renewed concerns about government overreach, citing recent scandals involving the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the seizure of phone records from reporters at the Associated Press, and the attack at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) accused the IRS's actions, which led to the resignation of the acting commissioner of the agency, of reflecting a greater undercurrent of political misdeeds by the federal government. She specifically cited the President's health care law as a measure rife with opportunities for political games.\n\n\"Knowing it's the IRS who will be the enforcing mechanism for this new entitlement program of Obamacare, it is very important to ask \u2013 and now it is reasonable to ask \u2013 could there be potential political implications of access to healthcare, denial of healthcare? Will that happen based upon a person's political beliefs, or their religiously held beliefs?\" Bachmann asked at the rally, which was attended by senators and representatives who were elected to office with support of tea party groups.\n\nTea party groups have long been wary of the President's health care law, and Republicans in Congress will vote for the thirty-seventh time to repeal the measure on Thursday. The groups have also been skeptical of government overreach into the personal lives of citizens, a fact lawmakers at Thursday's rally linked to the Justice Department's seizure of phone records from reporters and editors at the Associated Press.\n\nThose revelations coincided with renewed interest in September's attack at an American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya \u2013 long a rallying cry for tea party members who use it to claim incompetence and deception from Obama's national security team.\n\nCombined, the events of the last several days appeared to confirm in the minds of tea party Republicans their longstanding sense the government is working against them.\n\n\"The three events of the last few days \u2013 the IRS, the AP, and Benghazi \u2013 tend to confirm our worst fears about our government,\" Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said at Thursday's rally. \"They tend to tell us what we do not want to believe, but what sometimes turns out to be true. That your government is targeting you. That your government is spying on you. And that your government is lying to you.\"\n\nAt least one lawmaker, Bachmann, even floated the notion of impeachment during the event, saying what happened at the IRS was a scandal worse than Watergate.\n\n\"As I have been home in my district, in the sixth district of Minnesota, there has not been a weekend that's gone by without someone saying, 'Michelle, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why are you not impeaching the president? He's been making unconstitutional actions since he's been in Congress,'\" she said.\n\nObama's response to the mess \u2013 including demanding the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller \u2013 has only scratched the surface, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\n\"Someone needs to be held responsible. Someone needs to be imprisoned. Someone needs to be prosecuted,\" said Paul, who won election with tea party support in 2010 and has said he's eyeing a run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. \"The resignation is a step in the right direction, but we need to find out who wrote this policy, who approved this policy, and they need to be held accountable.\"\n\nBachmann, citing reports Miller has planned to step down in June anyway, described the resignation as a \"canard\" meant to allay citizens' fears without truly addressing the problem.\n\n\"Yesterday the president engaged in damage control 101,\" she said. \"He wanted to stop the story because the president's had a no good, very bad week this last week.\"",
    " Title: \"John Kerry Faces Skepticism as He Argues for War with Syria: A Questionable Intervention Amidst War-Weary America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 1971, Navy Lt. John F. Kerry asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\" This week, Secretary of State John F. Kerry found himself in a similar position, making his case for war with Syria - a war that a majority of Americans don't want, the administration still can't clearly justify, and for which Mr. Kerry himself made a very poor case.\n\nThe American people, weary from over a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, are not eager to commit to another questionable intervention. The country is also aware that whatever assurances this administration pretends it can give - that there will not be boots on the ground, that this will not be a protracted engagement - are all negotiable once the war begins.\n\nThe Washington Examiner's Tim Carney writes, \"Some members of Congress say they'll support a limited strike on Syria. But this is a fantasy. It relies on limiting two things that naturally defy limit: war and presidential power.\" Carney continues, \"War can not be tamed. War might turn out according to plan (for everyone who didn't get killed or maimed), but that's largely a matter of chance. Men can not control war - not even with the greatest military ever; not even with chants of 'Yes, we can'; not even with a Nobel Peace Prize.\"\n\nTo the extent that Mr. Kerry made a case at all - along with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel - the secretary was not very convincing. Even as the committee predictably approved authorization of the use of military force, the administration still failed to demonstrate any clear national security connection the United States has in Syria. The supposed justification for intervention to stop the use of chemical weapons still does not tell us how military action would actually deter their use. We're still not absolutely sure about the origins of their use.\n\nWhat we can be fairly sure of is that we will be helping rebel groups in Syria who are affiliated with al Qaeda. President Obama might not be able to articulate a national interest, but any American with memory can recognize a potential powder-keg component of this situation that should make us at least wary of helping the rebels. President George W. Bush promised in 2001, \"We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.\" Are we now on the eve of giving military shelter to the same people who attacked us on Sept. 11?\n\nThis is the elephant in the room that Mr. Kerry and nearly every other politician in support of war with Syria refuse to talk about. They can laugh or scoff all they want, and they can act as though the rebel group al-Nusra won't benefit from our efforts, but the enemy of our enemy Mr. Assad is not our friend - and he is still our enemy.\n\nNo reasonable person can look at the tragedy in Syria and not condemn the atrocities. However, what America can reasonably be expected to do about it is an entirely separate question. Neither Mr. Kerry nor anyone else in this administration has been able to answer such questions adequately. For war, \"classic\" or otherwise, essential questions concerning the national interest should be answered.\n\nAmerica is an exceptional and exemplary nation, seen as a beacon of freedom and justice around the world. We can't always be the policemen of the world, though, as the last decade has taught us. President Dwight Eisenhower once said, \"I have only one yardstick by which I test every major problem - and that yardstick is: Is it good for America?\" By every measure, war with Syria is not good for America. What's good for the Syrian rebels, Mr. Kerry, is not necessarily good for America. What's good for this president politically is not necessarily good for America. The administration has utterly failed to explain what good might come out of this war for the United States. There are too many troubling variables and dangerous unknowns.",
    " Title: Deloitte Report Highlights Potential Fiscal Consequences of U.S. Government's $16 Trillion Debt\n\nThe accounting firm Deloitte, one of the world's largest, has issued a report suggesting that the real cost of the U.S. government's nearly $16 trillion debt may be greater than commonly perceived. The report emphasizes the significant role of interest payments in exacerbating the country's debt problem, with interest payments on the national debt expected to total approximately $4.2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThe lead author of the Deloitte study, director Bill Eggers, underscores the potential for the U.S. government debt to escalate rapidly if investors become less willing to lend money. Eggers notes that if interest rates increase by 3 percent over the next decade, the additional cost to the Treasury, solely for interest payments, would equal the peak combined cost of the wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nDeloitte, an accounting and consulting firm that often audits government finances, outlines several potential uses for the $4.2 trillion:\n\n1. Paying tuition for every science, math, and engineering college degree in the country.\n2. Offsetting 80 percent of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n3. Distributing the funds as tax cuts.\n\nHowever, not all economists concur with the implications of the study. Robert Stonebraker, an economics professor at Winthrop University, contends that a significant portion of the interest on the debt goes back to Americans, thus diminishing the overall cost.\n\nEggers counters that a substantial portion of the interest payments do go overseas. He states, \"If you look at the interest payments going to foreign countries, soon we're going to be spending enough to essentially finance the Chinese military.\" Currently, foreigners own some $5 trillion in U.S. government bonds, with $1 trillion owned by China.\n\nStonebraker questions the urgency of addressing the debt crisis in the short term, stating that if the economy recovers, a significant part of the debt will decrease automatically. He argues that deficit spending is necessary during an economic slowdown to stimulate the economy and create jobs.\n\nOther analysts advocate for swift action to control the deficit, citing European countries that are cutting budgets as an example. Eggers acknowledges the need for budget cuts but argues that the debt is a pressing issue that will not resolve itself over time. \"The debt is not something that is going to go away the more time that goes by,\" he concludes.",
    " Title: House Republicans Offer Six-Week Debt Ceiling Extension, White House and Senate Democrats Remain Cautious\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations, House Republicans have proposed a six-week extension of the nation's borrowing limit in exchange for discussions on fiscal issues with the White House. The meeting between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner, along with other GOP leaders, at the White House on Thursday, marked a potential breakthrough in the 10-day-long partial government shutdown.\n\nThe proposal, which was met with a cautious response from the White House and Senate Democrats, would allow the government to continue borrowing until mid-November. The White House, however, has not made a definitive decision on the matter, with President Obama stating that further discussions are necessary.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed uncertainty about the House GOP's intentions, stating, \"We'll just wait and see, because they can't decide what they want.\" In a move to test the Senate's position, Reid set up a key filibuster test vote for Saturday, proposing a 15-month debt holiday.\n\nThe stock markets surged on Thursday in response to the mere suggestion of a debt deal by Speaker Boehner, highlighting the keen interest of business leaders in the negotiations. The administration has warned that the government will run out of room to borrow more money on Oct. 17, potentially leading to missed payments to Social Security recipients and veterans.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew outlined the potential consequences of reaching the debt limit, but declined to specify exact prioritization, stating, \"I think prioritization is just default by another name.\"\n\nThe debt negotiations have overshadowed the ongoing government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 due to disagreements between Congress, the White House, and Mr. Obama on funding the government for fiscal year 2014. The House passed a bill to restore more Border Patrol operations, while the Senate has yet to hold a floor vote on any of the piecemeal bills.\n\nIn related news, the White House signaled a willingness to reconsider some of its national park closures, stating it would seek to allow states to use their own funds to operate some sites. The exact implications of this development remain unclear.\n\nAs the negotiations continue, it remains uncertain whether the GOP is solely focused on a debt deal or whether they will consider adding a shutdown deal into the mix. The Obama administration, for its part, has expressed a preference for a Senate bill that would raise the borrowing limit beyond the 2014 elections.",
    " Title: Examining the Allegations of Racism: A Neutral Analysis of Conservative Policies and Accusations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, a recurring theme in political discourse has been the frequent accusations of racism leveled against individuals or parties on the right by prominent figures on the left, including politicians, cable news hosts, and entertainment figures.\n\nMSNBC host Chris Matthews, for instance, stated, \"The age of Jim Crow managed to find a new habitat in the 21st-century Republican Party.\" Comedian Seth Meyers told his late-night audience that Republicans \"traffic in open racism.\" Tennessee state representative London Lamar, a black woman, declared that the entire state of Tennessee is \"racist. Period.\" This was shortly after she was elected in Tennessee.\n\nThe practice of labeling the right as racist is not a new phenomenon; it has been ongoing for decades. Republican Presidents such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, his son, George W. Bush, have all been accused of being racists. From the left's perspective, \"racist\" is essentially Donald Trump's middle name.\n\nTo call someone a racist is a serious charge, implying that the individual believes one race is inherently superior or inferior to another. It's not intelligence, character, or values that determine an individual's worth; it's their skin color. To label racism as foolish and stupid \u2013 not to mention evil \u2013 is to understate the case. However, according to most Democrats, Republicans are that stupid and that evil.\n\nThis article aims to examine some conservative policies to determine if they are, indeed, racist. If they are, then the left has a valid complaint. And if they're not, then the left is lying.\n\nOne policy to scrutinize is the longstanding conservative opposition to Affirmative Action. The term \"affirmative action\" was first used by Democratic president John F. Kennedy in 1961. However, Affirmative Action in its current form was not implemented until 1970, during the administration of a Republican president, Richard Nixon.\n\nThe theory was that, due to historical discrimination, blacks were at a competitive disadvantage to other races and ethnicities. To erase that disadvantage, standards that most blacks presumably could not meet had to be lowered. One could argue that this policy had some utility when it was first put in place. But that was a long time ago. The conservative position is that blacks have repeatedly proven they can compete with anyone without the benefits of lower standards. There are countless examples of black success in every field, at every level. The policy is no longer necessary.\n\nHowever, the conservative argument goes further. Study after study shows that, in the case of college admissions, affirmative action hurts more blacks than it helps. By lowering admissions standards for blacks (and some other minority students), colleges set many of these students up for failure. They get placed in schools for which they are not prepared. And high black dropout rates confirm this view.\n\nAnother issue where the contrast between conservatives and those who accuse them of being racist is even more starkly drawn is voter ID. Conservatives argue that America should require every voter to present an ID when voting, similar to European countries to help keep their elections honest. Are all these democracies racist? Of course not. Yet the accusers say that conservatives who support voter ID are racist.\n\nThe left argues that it's a ruse to prevent blacks and other minorities from voting since many of them allegedly cannot acquire an ID. Can you get more condescending than that? Let's be real. You need an ID to drive, to fly, to buy a beer, even to purchase some cold medicines. Whites can do it, but blacks can't? Tell me again who the racists are?\n\nOne more example: it's conservatives who push for school choice, which would allow all parents, not just wealthy ones, to decide where their children attend school. Tuition vouchers, charter schools \u2013 these are conservative initiatives. Those on the left fight these reforms at every turn. It's the left that doesn't trust minority parents to select an appropriate school for their children. Why are those who keep black children in failing schools the racists?\n\nAt some point, maybe you'll start asking yourself, like I did: Who's really obsessed with race? The left or the right? And whose policies really hurt blacks?",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Vow to Continue Campaign Amid Calls for Withdrawal Following Controversial Tape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a defiant move, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence have indicated their intention to carry on with their campaign, despite mounting pressure for Trump to withdraw from the race following the release of a damaging audio tape.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that there was \"zero chance\" of him stepping down over lewd comments he made about women in a 2005 audio tape that surfaced on Friday. Trump expressed his determination, stating, \"I never, ever give up. The support I\u2019m getting is unbelievable, because Hillary Clinton is a horribly flawed candidate.\"\n\nLater in the day, a buoyant Trump emerged from his Trump Tower headquarters, high-fiving supporters who chanted \"U-S-A!\" and affirming, \"I will never let my supporters down.\"\n\nPence, who has described himself as a \"Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,\" also expressed his commitment to Trump. In a meeting with Rhode Island GOP Chairman Brandon Bell, Pence reportedly reassured attendees that they were still on a path to victory.\n\nAmid calls for Pence to replace Trump at the top of the Republican ticket, a senior Trump adviser told Fox News late Saturday that the Indiana governor was \"solid\" behind the nominee.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Pence issued a statement, expressing his disapproval of Trump's comments in the 11-year-old video. \"I do not condone his remarks and can not defend them,\" Pence said, adding, \"We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.\"\n\nPence also cancelled a planned appearance Saturday with House Speaker Paul Ryan in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin. Sources suggest the cancellation was due to the circumstances surrounding the tape.\n\nThe audio and accompanying video, released by The Washington Post and NBC News on Friday, recorded a conversation between Trump and \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush in which Trump described an attempt to have sex with a married woman. Trump boasted in the tape about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous, and also used a crude term for a part of a woman's anatomy.\n\nTrump apologized overnight for the comments, saying they \"don\u2019t reflect who I am.\" In a video message, he said, \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\"\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, and the party's 2008 nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, have withdrawn their support for Trump one month before the election, with early voting already underway in some key states.\n\nMany Republicans have gone further, calling on Trump to quit the race altogether. Alabama Rep. Martha Roby stated, \"Now, it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country and our party is for Trump to step aside and allow a responsible, respectable Republican to lead the ticket.\"\n\nRepublican leaders are scheduled to hold a conference call on Monday for House GOP lawmakers, who are out of town for Congress' election recess. The topic of the call is not specified, but rank-and-file lawmakers believe it is about Trump.\n\nWhile still publicly backing Trump, the Republican National Committee is considering how to move forward, with one possibility being re-directing its political operation towards helping vulnerable Senate and House candidates. Such a move would leave Trump with minimal political infrastructure in swing states to identify his supporters and ensure they vote.\n\nElection law experts suggest it would be logistically impossible to replace Trump on the ballot altogether, with early voting underway in some states and overseas ballots already distributed to military servicemen and others. However, Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick has reportedly been fielding calls from donors interested in funding a new candidate to replace Trump. Zwick suggested a write-in or \"sticker campaign\" relying on social media could \"actually work,\" although there has never been a winning write-in campaign in a U.S. presidential contest.",
    " Title: Delay in Termination Process for IRS Employees Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe termination process for federal workers involved in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups could be prolonged due to protections afforded to these employees. This development may disappoint lawmakers who are pressing for more heads to roll at the IRS.\n\nAt a hearing on Tuesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) expressed frustration, echoing the sentiments of his colleagues, asking, \"Why weren\u2019t more people fired?\" However, it appears that no formal reprimands have been issued, and a spokesperson for the union representing IRS workers has not been called to assist any employees yet.\n\nThe pressure is mounting as Lois Lerner, the director of the tax-exempt division at the IRS, is expected to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Wednesday. The GOP is also calling for the resignation of Sarah Hall Ingram, an official who previously worked in the tax-exempt division and now oversees the agency\u2019s implementation of the health care overhaul.\n\nTo terminate an IRS official, the incoming acting IRS Commissioner, Daniel Werfel, could initiate a clean-up process, but he would need to prepare for a lengthy appeals process. Under federal rules, a fired government worker has the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. They can challenge the decision, argue that their actions do not meet the threshold for termination, and request reinstatement, especially if there was no warning of trouble in past performance reviews.\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board is set up so that fired employees appealing their termination get two chances to prove they should stay. Their first stop is at the merit board\u2019s regional level, which, for the Cincinnati-based IRS employees in question, would be in Chicago. The initial appeals take an average of 93 days to process, according to William Spencer, a spokesman for the board.\n\nIf the regional board rules against the IRS employees, they can appeal to the national Washington, D.C.-based board, which takes an average of another 245 days. IRS employees would not receive a paycheck during the appeals process, and they would only be entitled to back pay if they are ultimately reinstated.\n\nMax Stier, who heads the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that recommends ways to improve the federal workforce, states, \"At the end of the day, if any agency has an employee who has really done something egregious and they want to get rid of them, they can do it.\"\n\nThere is also the option of placing IRS employees on administrative leave to expedite their removal, at least temporarily. However, IRS workers could still contest their removal if they have had positive performance reviews until now, and the board has been known to mitigate penalties if an employee is a first-time rule violator. Making this case about conduct does make it easier to bypass one part of the disciplinary rules for federal workers.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Divided on Egypt Aid Amidst Military Coup Debate\n\n Article:\n\n Members of the U.S. Congress are currently divided on the issue of Egypt's $1.5 billion in foreign aid, as the U.S. law requires the suspension of taxpayer funding to countries where a democratically elected government is deposed by a military coup.\n\n Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee suggested that funding should continue, while Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island expressed reluctance to cut the foreign spending. However, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona is insisting on the need to cut the purse strings in the wake of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's ouster by the country's military.\n\n House Republican Mike Rogers agrees with Sen. McCain, stating that aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met, including the establishment of elections and a free press. \"I think we have to be very, very careful in terms of suspending aid or cutting it off,\" Reed said. \"Will cutting off aid accelerate or enhance the opportunities and the chances to have a truly democratic government? I don't think so.\"\n\n Corker argued that Congress should not make any rash decisions on funding, stating, \"The aid doesn\u2019t flow on a daily basis. We'll have plenty of time to assess that. It seems to me that what we should be looking at is how the military and how the country itself handles this transition.\"\n\n McCain, appearing on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" pointedly stated that the military's action was a coup. \"It was a coup, and it was the second time in two-and-a-half years that we have seen the military step in. It's a strong indicator of the lack of American leadership and influence,\" McCain said. \"Reluctantly I believe that we have to suspend aid until such time as there is a new constitution and a free and fair election.\"\n\n President Barack Obama has not yet declared Morsi's ouster by the country's armed forces a military coup, but if such a declaration is made and recognized by the State Department, U.S. foreign aid would be eliminated.\n\n Florida Republican Rep. Trey Radel also agreed with McCain, stating that aid should be suspended until specific conditions are met. U.S. officials have been taking pains not to call the military's ousting of Morsi a coup, but Rogers says the law is \"very clear,\" and the United States should not act outside its own laws.\n\n Rogers suggested making an exemption to the current rule against aid after a military coup. \"The president needs to come to Congress,\" Rogers said. \"I would not try to circumvent the law by calling this something it is not.\"\n\n The Egyptian military is considered the one stable factor in the area, Rogers said. It did not overreact during the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak a year ago, and in the current situation was reacting to calls of secularists and more liberal and moderate factions rather than acting on its own, he said.\n\n Still, U.S. actions should be done in a legal way, Rogers said. The United States should help the military and then provide a way for multiple factions to participate in a newly elected government to allow for \"a march toward true democracy.\"\n\n Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. monetary investment in Egypt must lead to \"an Egypt for all.\" Menendez told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the $1.4 billion in aid is intended to protect domestic interests while helping Egypt along a path to democracy. \"This country doesn\u2019t have a history of democracy,\" the New Jersey Democrat said. \"The only way that Egypt will succeed is if it's an Egypt for all.\"\n\n U.S. leaders should insist on a swift transition to a civilian government, with all parties participating, new elections for the next president and the possibility of a new constitution, Menendez said. \"At the end of the day, while we have already made some obligations on that $1.4 billion, by no means have we made the overwhelming amount of that obligation,\" he said. \"This is an opportunity to have a pause and say to the Egyptians, 'You have an opportunity to come together.'\"\n\n A column published in Foreign Policy magazine by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, shortly before the overthrow, accused the administration of staying on the \"sidelines\" during the latest protests. \"In what has to be one of the most stunning diplomatic failures in recent memory, the United States is -- in both perception and reality -- entrenched as the partner of a repressive, Islamist regime and the enemy of the secular, pro-democracy opposition,\" he wrote.",
    " Title: NTSB Preliminary Report Reveals No Anomalies in Amtrak Derailment, Investigation Continues\n\nA preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday has found no issues with the braking system or the signals and track at the site of the May 12 Amtrak derailment that resulted in eight fatalities and over 200 injuries. The train, Amtrak 188, was traveling from Washington, D.C., to New York City when it derailed north of Philadelphia.\n\nThe NTSB report states that the train was traveling at 106 mph before the emergency brake system engaged. Data from the train's event recorder indicates that the engineer activated the emergency brakes seconds before the derailment. The seven-car and one-locomotive train had just entered the Frankford Junction curve, where the speed limit is 50 mph.\n\nThe NTSB is currently examining the Amtrak engineer's cell phone and cell phone records to determine whether the engineer used the phone while operating the train. The report notes that calls, text messages, and data usage appear to have occurred on the day of the accident, but investigators have not yet determined if there was any phone activity during the time the train was being operated.\n\nIn addition to investigating the engineer's cell phone usage, the NTSB is also looking into whether vandals may have thrown rocks or other objects at passing trains around the time of the derailment. The Amtrak 188 locomotive windshield has impact damage, but it is unclear whether the damage was caused by a thrown object or the crash itself. The report states that no evidence of gun-related damage was found.\n\nThe NTSB and FBI are also investigating the estimated $9.2 million in damage caused by the crash. Amtrak has committed to installing an automatic braking system on all trains on its tracks in the Northeast Corridor by the congressional deadline of Dec. 31. However, a section north of New York City operated by Metro-North will not meet this deadline.\n\nThe deadline for the installation of positive train control was set by Congress following a head-on collision between a Metrolink commuter train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California, in September 2008, which resulted in 25 fatalities and 100 injuries. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) reported approximately 300 injuries and 10 deaths in train accidents each year from 2003 through 2012, excluding highway-grade crossings and trespassers walking along tracks. The investigation into the Amtrak derailment is ongoing.",
    " Title: Tech Companies' Political Stances and Investments: A Closer Look at Lyft, Airbnb, and Others Amidst Travel Ban Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by political activism and app store success, ride-hailing service Lyft has found itself in the spotlight. The company, which recently cracked the top 10 free apps on Apple's App Store, has been praised for its stance against President Trump's travel ban and its pledge to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. However, a less-discussed aspect is the involvement of Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder, who is also an investor in Lyft. Thiel, a top tech advocate for Trump and an adviser on his transition team, has recently appeared to defend the travel ban.\n\nPeter Thiel's spokesman, Jeremiah Hall, stated in a statement provided to USA Today that \"Peter does not support a religious test, and the administration has not imposed one.\" The executive order on immigration affects seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOne software engineer on Twitter commented, \"So you're boycotting Uber, and running to Lyft where Peter Thiel is an investor? This ain't the woke you're looking for.\"\n\nIn response, Adrian Durbin, a spokesman for Lyft, stated, \"We don't always agree with our investors and are not afraid to say so. We do respect their right, and that of every American, to freedom of expression.\" When asked if the company disagrees with Thiel specifically, Durbin added, \"Our position on Trump's executive order is clear. I haven't seen if Thiel has made public comments about the EO, but if he supports it then it's safe to say we do not agree with him on that particular issue.\"\n\nLyft is not the only tech company to be outspoken against Trump's controversial executive order while opting not to distance themselves from Thiel. Airbnb's co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky slammed the ban as \"not right\" and announced his company would provide free housing to \"refugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S.\" Patrick Collison, the co-founder and CEO of Stripe, said he would match $50,000 in donations to the ACLU.\n\nBoth companies count Thiel as an investor, and neither business responded to CNNTech's requests for comment. Artsy, a startup whose CEO signed an open letter to Trump opposing the ban, downplayed Thiel's involvement in its business. \"Thiel was an early investor in Artsy and has no involvement in the day-to-day of the business,\" said Graham Newhall, a spokesman for Artsy.\n\nTech companies faced criticism during the campaign for speaking out against Trump's policies and rhetoric while refusing to distance themselves from Thiel. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, where Thiel is the longest-serving board member, framed the issue as allowing for diversity in all things, including politics. \"We can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post shortly before the election.\n\nZuckerberg spoke up against Trump's executive orders on immigration and refugees last week. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on Thiel. Y Combinator president Sam Altman, who wrote a blog post Saturday calling on the tech industry to \"start speaking up\" against the Trump administration, struck a similar tone to Zuckerberg about Thiel. \"I do not believe that deciding to get rid of all founders/employees who voted for someone is much better than a Muslim ban,\" Altman wrote on Twitter in response to a comment on his ties to Thiel.\n\nPando, a tech publication that counts Thiel's Founders Fund as an investor, has published articles critical of Thiel and Trump. However, founder Sarah Lacy notes the challenges that startups face in speaking out against the influential investor. \"Entrepreneurs are under a lot of pressure and Thiel... [is] very powerful,\" Lacy told CNNTech. \"Think about it this way: Look at how many people at the very top of the food chain are not speaking out or are only doing so recently and in mealymouth ways.\"",
    " Title: Violent Clashes Erupt Along Israel-Gaza Border as U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem Opens\n\nArticle:\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 The official opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday was met with violent clashes along the Israel-Gaza border, as Hamas orchestrated protests that left at least 43 Palestinians dead and hundreds more injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. The casualty numbers are expected to rise, and while the exact details are still being verified, Hamas has a history of exaggerating casualty claims.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 50,000 Gazans were participating in the clashes. According to the IDF, three Gazans were shot while attempting to plant explosive devices at the border fence, while others were killed attempting to open fire on Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported numerous violent attacks during the riots, with protesters setting tires on fire, assaulting the border fence, hurling rocks at soldiers, and flying incendiary kites toward Israel. One such kite sparked a fire in a field outside a Kibbutz, prompting Israeli firefighters and emergency personnel to respond.\n\nThe Facebook page for the Gaza riots instructed followers on where to breach the border fence and attempt to infiltrate Israeli communities, some of which are located about 1.2 miles from the Gaza border. The official Facebook page of the riots in Gaza published photos directing rioters to breach the fence and infiltrate nearby Israeli communities.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Israel's Shin Bet Security Services revealed that Iran is funding some of Hamas's chaos along the Gaza border. The Shin Bet stated that Hamas is encouraging and sending protesters to the border fence to carry out violent acts and damage security infrastructure. In addition, Iran is providing funding to Hamas to carry out these violent activities along the Gaza Strip's border fence.\n\nThe Shin Bet further stated that Hamas is instructing its own members to stay away from the border until civilians breach the barrier. The Shin Bet warned that Hamas operatives will only enter Israel under the cover of the masses and carry out terror attacks once the security fence falls.\n\nOn Sunday, the IDF warned in a video that Hamas is planning to \"massacre\" Israelis if its terrorists infiltrate the Israeli border. The army dropped leaflets over Gaza warning residents against approaching the border, attempting to sabotage it, or carrying out terror attacks.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman further warned Gazans against participating in Hamas's riots, stating, \"I suggest to the residents of Gaza: Do not be blinded by [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar, who sends your children to sacrifice their lives without hope.\" Lieberman added, \"We will protect our citizens by all means necessary and will not allow the fence to be breached.\"\n\nThis reporter previously analyzed some of the reasons Hamas may have organized the mass protests. Hamas understands the Gaza population is frustrated with 11 years of Hamas rule resulting in destructive wars and an economy dangerously teetering on the brink of collapse. Hamas's decision to turn Gaza into a terrorist enclave has prompted an Israel-Egypt boycott that has impacted all aspects of Gaza life. Gazans are also suffering from the Hamas-Fatah divide, with the rulers of the West Bank and Gaza Strip failing to reach a reconciliation agreement that would likely result in the flow of aid to Gaza. Hamas views Israel's upcoming 70th anniversary and President Donald Trump's historic decision to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem as perfect opportunities to channel Gazans' anger and redirect the rage toward the easiest target \u2013 Israel. Hamas knows the ensuing casualty count will bring international news media attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and it will thrust the issue to the forefront of the foreign policy debate. The border clashes may also press Egypt into easing the blockade and put Egyptian pressure on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party to reach a reconciliation deal since Gaza tensions usually favor the jihadists operating against Egypt in the Sinai. Abbas must fear that the protests could spread to the West Bank and threaten his rule there. Lastly, Hamas may also be signaling to Iran and to other potential state patrons that Hamas is still the dominant player in Gaza and that it is useful to financially support the terrorist movement once again.",
    " Title: Trump Alters Date of Tulsa Rally Amidst Criticism Over Juneteenth Holiday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events, President Donald Trump has decided to change the date of his scheduled # MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from June 19th to a different date, citing the Juneteenth Holiday as the reason for the shift.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump expressed his understanding of the significance of the Juneteenth Holiday and the importance of respecting it. He stated that many of his African American friends and supporters had suggested changing the date out of respect for the holiday.\n\nDuring a television interview with Fox News, Trump defended the new date, likening his rallies to celebrations and asserting that he has done more for the black community than any other president. He also made a comparison with Abraham Lincoln, stating that Lincoln did good, though the achievement is often questioned.\n\nThe timing and location of the rally have drawn heavy criticism from African American leaders and Democrats, who argue that it sends the wrong message, particularly in the wake of weeks of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Tulsa was the site of a 1921 massacre in which a white mob killed dozens of black people and destroyed black-owned businesses.\n\nRep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), an African American woman considered as a possible running mate for Joe Biden, tweeted that \"Tulsa was the site of the worst racist violence in American history.\" She further stated that Trump's speech there on Juneteenth is a message to every Black American: more of the same.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), also a black lawmaker on Biden's list of potential vice presidents, tweeted, \"This isn't just a wink to white supremacists\u2014he's throwing them a welcome home party.\"\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) commended Trump's decision to delay the rally, stating that he is thankful President Trump recognizes the significance of June 19 and has chosen to move his campaign rally out of respect to Oklahomans and the important Juneteenth celebrations.\n\nHowever, Oklahoma state Rep. Ajay Pittman (D), a member of the legislature's Black Caucus, criticized Trump's decision, stating that he only changed the date due to the backlash and not \"an attempt to respect\" the holiday.\n\nTulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum (D) seemed to try to temper potential protests of Trump's visit in a tweet Thursday after the rally was first announced, stating, \"In Tulsa, we protect the free and peaceful exchange of ideas. We did it during the last two weeks of protests, and we will do it during the President's visit to Tulsa next week.\"\n\nTrump's rallies, which typically draw thousands of supporters, have been on hold since March due to the coronavirus pandemic.",
    " Title: The Institutional Battle of Brexit: A Look at the Procedural Conflicts and Declining Trust in Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of London, the political landscape has been marked by a series of procedural conflicts as the United Kingdom navigates its withdrawal from the European Union. The April version of the bill, which passed partly due to Theresa May's recognition of her diminishing support, is now facing resistance from the new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Johnson is reportedly planning to use every available means, including filibustering, to hinder the bill's progress in the unelected upper house.\n\nThe political progress of Brexit, often characterized by intricate parliamentary procedures and court battles, has been a far cry from the public's expectations. Terms such as \"prorogation,\" \"humble addresses,\" and \"paving motions\" have become commonplace, yet remain unfamiliar to the general public, prompting constitutional experts to step into the limelight.\n\nA survey by the Hansard Society reveals a dwindling trust in politicians, with only a third of people believing that politicians act in the public interest, and nearly half feeling they have no influence on decision-making. This lack of trust is a significant factor in the complexities surrounding Brexit, a matter that was always expected to be technically challenging due to the European Union's intricate political sequencing.\n\nThe root cause of the escalating conflict in British politics, however, is domestic. Despite losing her majority in 2017, Theresa May's conduct of Brexit was characterized by her autocratic instincts and aversion to parliamentary consultation. This high-handed approach led to her being taken to the Supreme Court to assert Parliament's right to a \"meaningful vote,\" and then embroiled in a battle over the disclosure of the attorney general's legal advice, resulting in her being censured for \"contempt of Parliament.\"\n\nThe prominence of procedural conflicts since the Brexit referendum has led to political questions being transformed into arguments about legal permissibility. Issues such as the kind of state Britain wishes to be, its relations among constituent nations, its immigration policies, its Irish history, its domestic political choices, and the extent of its economic integration with other European states are all intertwined in, or lost within, conflicts over parliamentary rights and legal obligations.\n\nThe intensity of these procedural debates has led to a shift in public sentiment, with apparently dry matters taking on political energy. This energy has manifested in high court judges being labeled \"enemies of the people\" by tabloid press and previously pacific sections of society becoming ardent protesters.\n\nAs the Brexit saga unfolds, the question of trust in politics remains a significant concern. The public's growing disillusionment with the political process, coupled with the complexities of Brexit, has created a challenging environment for the UK's future.",
    " Title: Tea Party Movement Gains Momentum Amidst IRS Scandal: A Resurgence in 2014 Elections?\n\nThe Tea Party movement, known for its advocacy of less government and anti-tax policies, is experiencing a resurgence following the revelation that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeted conservative groups and organizations for scrutiny in the past few years.\n\nAccording to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, 44 percent of likely U.S. voters now have a favorable opinion of the Tea Party, a 14-percentage-point increase from January and just 7 points below the record high of 51 percent in April 2009. The poll also showed a decrease in the percentage of voters with an unfavorable opinion of the movement, down 5 points from earlier this year.\n\nSal Russo, co-founder of the California-based Tea Party Express, told FoxNews.com over the weekend that there has been a significant increase in both interest and donations since the IRS targeting scandal broke earlier this month. Russo stated that Tea Party members feel vindicated and energized by the news, knowing that their political opponents would stop at nothing to undermine their cause.\n\nThe Tea Party movement, which started in 2009 in response to the federal government's multibillion-dollar bank bailouts during the recession, played a major role in the 2010 midterm elections by backing conservative candidates who helped Republicans take control of the House. However, critics argued that the movement had become less relevant during the 2012 election cycle.\n\nThe resurgence of the Tea Party movement could potentially impact the 2014 elections, particularly in terms of the internal struggles within the Republican party, particularly between the conservative caucus and the more moderate chamber leadership. Rasmussen Reports President Scott Rasmussen suggested that the IRS targeting scandal could thrust the Tea Party into the 2014 elections and that the scandal might have a bigger impact on Democrats, as it cuts into the heart of President Obama's agenda, which is faith in government, and his health-care plan is tied to the IRS.\n\nRusso expressed enthusiasm about the 2014 elections, stating that he was currently working on potential races. However, he was uncertain about how long the scandal might remain in the voters' consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, the IRS targeting scandal has reignited interest in the Tea Party movement, with a significant increase in favorable opinions and donations. The movement's resurgence could potentially impact the 2014 elections, particularly in terms of the internal struggles within the Republican party and the potential impact on Democrats. It remains to be seen how long the IRS scandal will remain in the voters' consciousness and whether the Tea Party movement will continue to gain momentum in the lead-up to the 2014 elections.",
    " Title: House Republicans Reject Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Senate Sponsors Remain Optimistic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the immigration reform debate continues to unfold, the House of Representatives has taken a different approach from the Senate, with Republicans favoring a series of targeted bills over the comprehensive approach passed by the Senate last week. Key sponsors of the Senate legislation, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), remain hopeful that the House will eventually adopt a broader package that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and enhanced border security.\n\nThe bipartisan group of senators, known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" has been instrumental in shepherding the immigration bill through the Senate. The measure, which passed with the support of 14 Republicans and Senate Democrats, is being hailed as a significant step forward in immigration reform, demonstrating the potential for bipartisan solutions to complex issues.\n\nSen. Schumer, a member of the Gang of Eight, expressed optimism during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" stating, \"I believe by the end of this year, the House will pass the Senate bill. I know that\u2019s not what they think now, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, no, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen,\u2019 but I think it will.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-OH) and other Republican leaders have rejected President Obama's timetable for the House to pass an immigration reform bill by the end of July. Instead, they are indicating that the House will take its own approach to immigration reform, setting aside the Senate bill that covers citizenship, border security, employment verification systems, and other steps.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and border security, reiterated this position during a Sunday morning interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" He dismissed Sen. Schumer's comments, stating, \"We\u2019re not going to take his advice. The Senate bill is not going to pass in the House.\"\n\nRepublicans have several objections to the Senate bill, with the primary concern being that illegal immigrants will be granted a path to citizenship before the U.S.-Mexico border is fully secured. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" program Sunday, referred to the Reagan-era immigration reform bill and expressed concern that the federal government failed to live up to its obligations on the security front.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, argue that the House is abandoning the bipartisan work accomplished in the Senate. Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-IL), chairman of the House Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force, stated, \"What the House Republicans are doing is giving a Republican solution. A Republican solution isn\u2019t what we saw was successful in the Senate.\"\n\nSenate Republicans who back the comprehensive package, such as Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), are urging the House to take action while acknowledging the challenges faced by House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). \"I believe Speaker Boehner has a tough job ahead. I admire his leadership, but we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\" said Sen. McCain, also appearing on Fox.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus Results Reflect a Shift Towards Anti-Establishment Candidates and Extreme Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Iowa caucuses on Monday saw a clear trend towards anti-establishment candidates, with Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson capturing a combined 60% of the Republican vote, and Bernie Sanders winning nearly half of the Democratic votes. This shift towards extremes in the first round of the 2016 presidential race has raised concerns about the future of American politics.\n\nDavid Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN and a White House adviser to four presidents, has compared Donald Trump's political brand to an upraised middle finger. This brand, it seems, has resonated with voters, who, in Iowa, rejected Trump the candidate but adopted his anti-establishment message. Similarly, on the Democratic side, Sanders' campaign for a revolution has gained significant traction.\n\nThe results of the Iowa caucuses indicate a clear message of no confidence in the current economic order. The strength of Sanders and the top Republican candidates suggests a disillusionment with the status quo that is unprecedented in recent presidential campaigns.\n\nWhile it is possible that each party may ultimately nominate a more centrist candidate, the Iowa caucuses will have significant consequences. For the Democrats, Sanders' strength is likely to draw Hillary Clinton further to the left on issues, as she seeks to close the enthusiasm gap with Sanders and secure his support in a general election campaign.\n\nFor the Republicans, the strength of Cruz, particularly in red states, will force the party establishment to extend an olive branch to the far right, even as they attempt to unite the party behind a more moderate candidate, such as Marco Rubio.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses could signal a shift towards a more extreme American politics, as the sluggish growth of the economy over the past 10 years has fueled anger and frustration among voters. Unfortunately, most economists predict that this economic malaise is likely to persist, regardless of who is elected in November. This could mean that the Iowa caucuses are a harbinger of politics to come.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Iowa caucuses represent only a tiny fraction of the American electorate, with Cruz winning the GOP caucuses with some 50,000 votes, or about 2% of the state's registered voters. However, as Gergen points out, big changes in America often come from small towns and hamlets. The results of this year's first vote of the 2016 race may well be a sign of things to come.",
    " Title: Newtown Tragedy Prompts Bipartisan Effort in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner have resumed talks to meet the year-end deadline for a deal on the fiscal cliff. The shooting, which has prompted a national outpouring of grief and introspection, has reportedly had a moderating effect on the usually contentious political climate in Washington.\n\nThe real test for any deal, however, is whether it gets approved by enough lawmakers in both parties. But in deflecting attention from the fiscal dispute, the impact of the shooting could give the party leaders a little more room to maneuver.\n\nJohn Feehery, a former adviser to three House Republican leaders, said, \"It takes the fire out of the belly of partisans, just kind of puts everything in perspective and makes people question, well, everything. What's the point?\"\n\nSteve Elmendorf, a former top adviser to House Democratic leaders, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"The American people are going to be sharing in the grief of Connecticut families and will have little patience for political games and finger-pointing.\"\n\nOn Friday, after news of the shooting broke, Mr. Obama spoke by phone with Mr. Boehner; the evening before, they had met alone for only the second time since the November election. Reports through the weekend suggested that Mr. Boehner had come some way toward the president's position, offering for the first time to support raising the tax rate on high incomes and include an increase in the nation's debt limit, if the president agreed to more long-term reductions in entitlement programs.\n\nTom Daschle, a Democrat and former Senate majority leader, was initially a skeptic among the Democrats and Republicans interviewed, who generally saw a chance for some breakthrough. \"Unfortunately, I don't think it will have a catalytic effect on the fiscal negotiations,\" he said. \"We are still not at the 11th hour and 59th minute. That is when a deal is likely to be struck.\"\n\nHowever, in a follow-up exchange of e-mails, Mr. Daschle acknowledged some moderating effect. \"There might have been some genuine movement over the weekend,\" he said.\n\nThat Mr. Boehner seemed to make the first move this weekend was unsurprising given what all sides agree is Republicans' far weaker position in the budget talks. The recent election results favored Mr. Obama and the Democrats, and many polls show that significant majorities of Americans would blame Republicans if the talks failed.\n\nTad Devine, a longtime Democratic strategist, said, \"I'm trying to be nonpartisan with this, but honestly, I think the Republicans have a big challenge.\" He added, \"They're not only in the position of defending tax breaks for rich people, but one issue that they don't even want to talk about\u2014gun control\u2014is now front and center.\"\n\nBut Democrats, too, have reason to fear a voter backlash from any show of politics as usual as Newtown buries its dead. Mr. Daschle said a fiscal failure would ignite \"talk of total dysfunction in Washington and ridicule of all involved,\" though he added, \"The Republicans will bear the brunt of it all.\"\n\nThe shooting could well have another effect on both sides. The prospect of party leaders having to call lawmakers back to the Capitol between Christmas and New Year's Eve to finish the work on the deficit, never a popular move, becomes all the more difficult now that members of Congress are likely to value time at home with their own children and grandchildren all the more.",
    " Title: The Irony of Political Polarization: The Death Penalty Debate and Amy Coney Barrett\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the confirmation of judicial nominees, the polarization of political ideologies has become increasingly evident. This is particularly true in the case of Amy Coney Barrett, a Catholic jurist who has faced criticism from Senate Democrats for her traditional Catholic views, despite her opposition to the death penalty.\n\nThe Democrats' apprehension towards Barrett, rooted in her perceived adherence to conservative Catholic doctrine, is ironic given her stance on the death penalty, a position that aligns with the views of many Democrats. The controversy was sparked by a comment made by Senator Dianne Feinstein during Barrett's confirmation hearing for her appointment to the federal appeals court, where Feinstein criticized Barrett for deferring to modern liberal views on the death penalty, rather than authoritative Church teaching.\n\nThis incident highlights a misunderstanding of Barrett's beliefs, as she is not a carbon copy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. While both share a conservative judicial philosophy, their views on the death penalty and the recusal of Catholic judges differ significantly. Scalia, for instance, was not known for deferring to the Church's stance on the death penalty, which has been evolving in recent decades.\n\nThe death penalty is a contentious issue, with some arguing it is intrinsically unjust, while others believe it is a legitimate means of punishment for certain crimes. The Catholic Church's stance on the issue has been a subject of debate, with some arguing that it is a matter of prudential judgment rather than a binding, infallible teaching.\n\nIn a 1990 article in First Things, Scalia wrote, \"The current predominance of opposition to the death penalty is the legacy of Napoleon, Hegel, and Freud rather than St. Paul and St. Augustine.\" He criticized the Church's willingness to deviate from traditional teachings on the death penalty, arguing that such a stance could potentially exclude Catholics from public office or jury duty in capital cases.\n\nThe Church's stance on the death penalty, as Scalia noted, is not a long-standing or universally accepted teaching. In fact, it is a relatively recent development in the Church's history. This has led some, including Scalia, to question the authenticity of the Church's current position, particularly when compared to its unwavering stance on issues like birth control and abortion.\n\nIn the current political climate, the left's opposition to Barrett as a potential Supreme Court nominee presents an intriguing paradox. While liberals are urging Senate Democrats to prevent an opponent of the death penalty from joining the Supreme Court, many conservatives are advocating for her appointment. In another era, the roles might have been reversed, with the left supporting an anti-death penalty Catholic and the right expressing reservations.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to tolerate pro-life Catholics who oppose the death penalty is a testament to the extreme leftward shift in their ideology. This polarization has created a divide that goes beyond the death penalty debate, affecting various aspects of American politics and society.",
    " Title: The Language of Torture: A Debate on Enhanced Interrogation Techniques and the CIA's Role\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the term \"torture\" has been a contentious issue. The misuse of this term has clouded the discussion and hindered clarity on a critical matter.\n\nDuring the recent confirmation hearings for Gina Haspel, the nominee for Director of the CIA, the term \"torture\" posed a challenge, obstructing a clear path to her potential leadership role. The question of whether these techniques constitute torture has been a recurring theme since the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nThe confusion arises from defining lawful and justifiable questioning techniques as \"torture,\" a term that connotes abuse of power, motivated by a desire to punish, or even by sadistic satisfaction. Those opposed to enhanced interrogation will label American practices as such, while defenders of these procedures risk being drawn into debates where they appear to \"defend torture.\"\n\nIt is essential to clarify that there is no defense for torture, as defined. Torture is what the North Vietnamese did to American soldiers, what drug cartels do to their enemies, and what North Korea did to Otto Warmbier. However, it is not what American intelligence officers have done to save lives.\n\nIf this seems like an assertion that it's not torture if we do it, that is precisely the point. As long as our intentions remain noble, our behaviors clearly defined, and the practices closely supervised, \"torture\" has always had a negative connotation presuming a sinister motivation. This is the exact opposite of what Haspel and the CIA have been about, and it is an offense to logic to continue labeling our practices as such.\n\nOne may favor or oppose sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, or waterboarding, but these practices and others were employed in the cases of carefully screened detainees in an attempt to secure information vital to defeating jihadists and saving lives.\n\nWaterboarding has always been a particularly ill-fitting term for torture designation. It is not torture if we do it to our own people. I have spoken to special forces veterans who endured the practice in training, so as to better brace for it if captured. One told me, \"It's hell while it's happening, but twenty minutes later I was drinking a cup of coffee without a mark on me.\"\n\nIt may be tempting to invoke the views of John McCain, who was indeed tortured by the North Vietnamese. Today, he unfortunately equates that horror to what his fellow Americans honorably did to serve our nation as he has done.\n\nSo where do I get off questioning McCain's view on the subject? I rest on two answers, one broad, one specific. The broad anecdotal testimony is the nearly two decades I have spent speaking to veterans and active-duty military, on and off the radio. They do not unanimously support enhanced interrogations, but I can count on one hand those who have shared the McCain view that we are torturers.\n\nThe specific voice I rely on the most is Rep. Sam Johnson (R-TX), retiring after nearly 30 years in Congress and his own seven years in the Hanoi Hilton. Like McCain, he was brutally tortured by the North Vietnamese. Unlike McCain, he did not return to America with the willingness to smear our post-9/11 war effort with such harsh criticism.\n\nIn answering questions during her hearing, Haspel seemed to stumble on this years-long mischaracterization of CIA techniques as torture. Under fire from disapproving Democrats, she revealed that she would not oversee a return to such procedures, even under a lawful order from the President: \"I support the higher moral standard that this country has decided to hold itself to. I would never, ever take CIA back to an interrogation program.\"\n\nCount me among those who have strongly supported Haspel's nomination. But more importantly, count me among those who would expect her to follow lawful orders from the Commander-in-Chief without bogging the nation down in needless moments of introspection.\n\nOur discourse will be unburdened if we can resist attempts to hijack the language for political gain. The left must be congratulated for its multiple successes. Abortion is \"reproductive freedom,\" confiscatory taxation is \"investment,\" and enhanced interrogations are torture.\n\nOpponents of such practices are free to characterize them as unduly harsh, unnecessary, discordant with \"American values,\" or whatever. I would disagree on all counts, but those are matters of opinion.\n\nTo fine-tune a famous Daniel Patrick Moynihan quote, we are entitled to our own opinions; we are not entitled to redefine words. Once we free ourselves from the years of miscast debate over American \"torture,\" we can honestly argue the pros and cons of how our nation has extracted intelligence from certain sources.\n\nAnd who knows? Once we stop surrendering to the language of the CIA's detractors, even its future director might rethink her contrived objections to orders she may one day receive.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Delivers Powerful Defense of President Obama at Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to strengthen President Barack Obama's case for a second term, former President Bill Clinton delivered a compelling speech at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, offering a robust defense of the current administration and a clear contrast to the Republican Party's stance.\n\nClinton, who walked onto the stage to tumultuous applause, stated, \"We are here to nominate a president, and I've got one in mind.\" His speech, reminiscent of his classic style, was tailored not for the audience in the Charlotte arena, but for those watching at home, particularly in battleground states like Ohio and Michigan.\n\nClinton's speech was packed with policy details, interspersed with folksy asides and an Arkansas drawl, and a full-on attempt to rebut the messages from the GOP convention last week in Tampa. He addressed point by point the Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's assertions about Medicare and Medicaid spending proposals.\n\nMore importantly, Clinton aimed to build a bridge for voters concerned about the economy to cross over to the Democrats' side in November. He spoke of the severely damaged economy Obama inherited, one that was shedding 750,000 jobs a month, a scenario worse than the one he faced in 1992. However, Obama, according to Clinton, \"stopped the slide into depression\" and has built a foundation under the economic cracks.\n\nClinton posed questions to the audience, such as, \"Are we where we want to be today?\" and \"Is the president satisfied?\" but followed with, \"But are we better off than when he took office?\" The message was clear: while the recovery is slow, renewing Obama's contract will bring tangible benefits.\n\nClinton also touched on the desire for a functioning government and leaders who compromise, a sentiment reflected in recent polls. He presented Obama as committed to constructive work and criticized the far right's perceived hatred of the president.\n\nClinton also highlighted the cooperative relationship between Obama and Hillary Clinton after their 2008 primary, mentioning that Obama appointed several of Hillary Clinton's people to top positions and, of course, Hillary herself.\n\nIf there remain undecided voters in Ohio, Michigan, or any other battleground state after Clinton's impassioned speech that ended in an on-stage embrace with the current president, it seems unlikely that anything more could be said to sway them.\n\nClinton's speech was a powerful response to the Republican argument against Obama's re-election, which, according to Clinton, was essentially, \"We left him a total mess. He has not cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and put us back in.\" The crowd in the arena roared, but it remains to be seen how the folks at home in Ohio and Michigan will react. The convention continues, and the race to the White House heats up.",
    " Title: Reflecting on the Legacy of the First Mulatto Presidency: A Look at Race Relations and Identity Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nWith eight months remaining in the first mulatto presidency, the legacy of Barack Obama is being reevaluated, particularly in terms of race relations and identity politics. In a recent article, George Conway, husband of White House advisor Kellyanne Conway, criticized Obama for being more deeply invested in racial identity politics than expected.\n\nConway, who is set to take part in MSNBC's impeachment hearing coverage, opined that Obama had a chance to transcend race consciousness during his presidency but failed to do so. Instead, the country has witnessed a surge in racial unrest, with incidents such as the riots in Baltimore and Ferguson, and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe movement, which was formed in response to the deaths of black individuals at the hands of police, has been criticized for its exclusive focus on black lives killed by white cops while ignoring the skyrocketing black-on-black murder rate. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that 69 percent of Americans view race relations as generally bad, the highest level of discontent since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles during the Rodney King case.\n\nThe article also points out the tragic events in Dallas and Baton Rouge, where two black males, seemingly radicalized online by militant Afrocentrism, targeted and murdered eight police officers. The article argues that discussions of police maltreatment of blacks and surging inner-city violence should not be treated as mutually exclusive issues.\n\nThe article also touches on the topic of mixed-race politicians identifying solely with their minority heritage. It mentions Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who \"passed for white\" while attending Colgate University but later opted to champion the black cause. The article questions the motivations behind such decisions, citing sociologist Everett Stonequist's theory that a primary cause of the mulatto's emergence as a race leader is a perceived gap between their aspirations and their status.\n\nThe article concludes by quoting mixed-race poet and novelist Jean Toomer, who advocated for a unified human race. The article suggests that black/white multiracial Americans largely fall into two camps, one in agreement with Toomer's worldview and the other viewing their European ancestry and the attendant colonialist history as evil incarnate, irredeemably racist.\n\nThe article is a thought-provoking exploration of race relations, identity politics, and the complexities of mixed-race identity in America. It raises important questions about the role of leaders in shaping race relations and the impact of identity politics on society. The article is written in a neutral and informative tone, providing a balanced perspective on the topic.",
    " Title: Democratic National Convention Preview: Tensions, Rising Stars, and Western Forays\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicks off in Philadelphia this week, tensions between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are expected to surface, albeit not to the extent of the Republican primary's Trump-Cruz dynamic. The convention, which will nominate Clinton as the Democratic presidential candidate, is set to feature a few dustups and potentially brush fires, as CNN's Jeff Zeleny described the potential for Clinton-Sanders tensions.\n\nSome Sanders delegates are hoping for a platform to voice their concerns, particularly regarding Clinton's vice presidential pick and the recent DNC leak incident. One of the Sanders' convention priorities was the elimination of superdelegates, elected officials and party activists who wield convention votes and can decide who to support regardless of voting in their home states. The party establishment's desire to protect its perks has led to trouble in the convention rules committee, but the proposed rules do call for a study, which may steer the commission toward Sanders' priorities.\n\nThe Democrats are searching for a rising star to emerge this week, much like how Barack Obama made his big jump in 2004 as a prime-time speaker at the convention in Boston that nominated John Kerry for president. However, the list of Democratic prospects this year is not as long due to the GOP's success in state and local elections during the Obama years.\n\nWillie Brown, a liberal activist and former San Francisco mayor, has been a fixture at Democratic conventions. He recalls the struggles African-American delegates faced in getting their credentials, and his oral history offers insights into the changing nature of these conventions.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is heading west this week, aiming to make inroads in a region that has been difficult for him. Colorado, a swing-state prize, is the focus of Trump's efforts, and recent polls show a steady lead for Hillary Clinton. However, Trump being more competitive in Colorado could help tilt the electoral college.\n\nIn conclusion, the DNC in Philadelphia is set to be a week of political maneuvering, potential tensions, and the search for the next Democratic rising star. The Republicans, on the other hand, are looking to make inroads in the West, with Colorado being a key focus. The conventions will provide valuable insights into the strategies and priorities of both parties as they head into the general election.",
    " Title: The Ouster of Michael Flynn: A Test of America's Democratic Institutions\n\nThe resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor has been a significant event in American politics, but the circumstances surrounding his departure have raised concerns about the state of the nation's democratic institutions. The episode, marked by allegations of illegal leaks and clandestine operations, has been described as a \"soft coup\" or \"political assassination\" engineered by anonymous intelligence community bureaucrats.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Flynn's ouster has been a source of debate, with some viewing it as a necessary exposure of potential collusion between the Russians and a senior aide to the president, while others see it as an example of the manipulation of public opinion for political gain.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet, expressed concern over the numerous illegal leaks coming out of Washington, stating, \"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?\" This concern is shared by many, as these leaks, when used for political purposes, can be seen as weaponized spin.\n\nHowever, the issue at hand is not the outcome of Flynn's resignation, but rather the means by which it was achieved. The role of unelected, unaccountable intelligence community members leaking classified information to the press is a matter of grave concern. Such actions undermine the democratic process and the principle of public accountability.\n\nIn a liberal democracy, procedures matter. The chaotic and dysfunctional nature of the Trump administration has placed significant strain on the system. However, the answer is not to counter it with equally irregular acts of sabotage or disinformation campaigns waged by nameless civil servants toiling away in the surveillance state.\n\nThe role of Congress is to investigate alleged wrongdoing by public officials. If Congress is reluctant to act, the American people have no choice but to demand accountability through phone calls, protests, and ultimately, votes. Sitting back and letting shadowy, unaccountable agents of espionage do the job for us is not an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe end goal should be to uphold the principles of democracy, transparency, and accountability. The American people must demand that their elected representatives fulfill their duty to investigate the president and his administration, and that the intelligence community operates within the bounds of the law and the democratic process.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in May, Raising Concerns Ahead of November Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the U.S. job market showed a significant slowdown in May, with employers adding just 69,000 jobs, according to a report from the Labor Department on Friday. This figure is far below the expected growth and marks the slowest pace of hiring in a year.\n\nThe disappointing jobs report has sparked concerns, particularly as the November election approaches. The slowdown in hiring was observed across various industries in many parts of the country. The sluggish job growth sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting nearly 275 points.\n\nRepublican White House hopeful Mitt Romney seized on the report as an opportunity to criticize President Obama's handling of the economy. Meanwhile, President Obama emphasized that the U.S. is still adding jobs, albeit not at a rapid enough pace.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, attributes the slowdown to several factors, including the sell-off in the stock market, the slowing growth in China, and the ongoing European debt crisis. Zandi explains, \"Businesspeople are just very nervous. They've been through a lot. If anything goes off-script, they pull back. They stop hiring.\"\n\nThe 69,000 jobs added in May represent a significant decrease compared to previous months. Simultaneously, hundreds of thousands of new jobseekers entered the labor market, causing the unemployment rate to rise to 8.2 percent.\n\nThe disappointing jobs report comes at a critical time for Obama, as these months typically shape voters' opinions about the economy as they prepare for the November election. Obama acknowledged the challenges, stating, \"We knew there would be ups and downs along the way, but we also knew if we were willing to act wisely and boldly, and if we were acting together as Americans... and never quit, then we would not just come back. We'd come back stronger than ever.\"\n\nRomney, on the other hand, argues that the president has had ample time to turn the economy around. Speaking on CNBC on Friday, Romney said, \"Their policies have not worked, and in many respects, their policies have made it harder for the economy to recover.\"\n\nObama's supporters counter that the struggling job market is more a result of Congress's failure to pass the president's policies rather than a reflection of his policies' effectiveness. Jared Bernstein, Vice President Joe Biden's former chief economist, notes that the president has faced difficulty getting his policies through Congress since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.\n\nBernstein, now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, suggests that the political gridlock has exacerbated the economic situation. \"The political gridlock, or dysfunction, if you will, has made things even worse,\" he says. \"Now we're talking about going over this fiscal cliff and having another debt ceiling fight.\"\n\nAs the election draws near, both candidates are focusing on their respective job creation records. Obama renewed his call for congressional action on the jobs front, while his re-election campaign has been actively criticizing Romney's job creation record during his tenure as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nNathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, suggests that history indicates it is Obama who will be held accountable for the economy if things do not improve before November. \"Voters just want to feel like the country and the economy are headed in the right direction,\" he says. \"And I do not know if enough voters believe that right now to help the president win a second term.\"\n\nWith fewer than six months remaining until the election, time is running out for either candidate to significantly alter voters' perceptions of the economy and their own job creation records.",
    " Title: Deadliest Fire in New York City in 25 Years Claims Lives of Four Children and Eight Adults\n\nArticle:\n\nA tragic fire incident has left 12 people, including four children, dead in an apartment building in the Bronx borough of New York. The fire, which occurred on Prospect Avenue, near Fordham University and the Bronx Zoo, is the deadliest in the city in at least 25 years, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nThe victims include a one-year-old child, as confirmed by Mayor de Blasio. The New York Police Department reported that a boy and three girls, aged one, two, and seven, were among the deceased.\n\nThe cause of the fire is yet to be determined. The fire started on the first floor and quickly spread, with more than 160 firefighters working to bring it under control. Television footage showed firefighters rescuing people from fire escapes, and residents who managed to escape huddled outside in bitterly cold conditions.\n\nThe first alarm was raised at the five-storey building around 19:00 local time. The fire service managed to rescue at least 12 people from the building.\n\nSpeaking at the scene, Mayor de Blasio expressed his condolences, stating, \"We're here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy. Tonight, here in the Bronx, there are families that have been torn apart. This is the worst fire tragedy we have seen in this city in at least a quarter century.\"\n\nFire Commissioner Daniel Nigro described the fire as \"a tragedy... without question historic in its magnitude.\" He added, \"People died on various floors of the apartment [block]... In a department that is surely no stranger to tragedy, we're shocked by the lives lost.\"\n\nWitnesses reported seeing people using a fire escape of the burning building as the fire raged. Luz Hernandez, a resident who escaped from her fourth-floor apartment, told the New York Times that her apartment filled with thick smoke. She and her family escaped through a fire escape as the smoke continued to rise around them.\n\nThe building, which contains more than 20 flats and was built over 100 years ago, is the deadliest fire in New York since 87 people died at a social club in the Bronx in 1990, excluding the 9/11 attacks.\n\nEarlier this month, a mother and her three children died in a fire at their home in Brooklyn, New York. The city is currently experiencing a severe cold snap, with temperatures dropping to around -10C (13F). The water from the firefighters' hoses could be seen turning to ice on the ground during the firefighting efforts. The Red Cross handed out blankets to those on the street, as some residents fled the building without shoes or coats.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Expresses Concerns Over Origins of Trump-Russia Probe, Seeks Answers from Durham Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Attorney General William Barr has expressed his concerns about the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, stating that he has been \"trying to get answers to questions\" but found that \"a lot of the answers have been inadequate.\" The Attorney General made these comments during a trip to San Salvador, where he was discussing gang violence, the border crisis, and other issues of concern to the United States.\n\nDuring the interview, Fox News' Bill Hemmer played a brief portion of the conversation, in which Barr stated, \"I've been trying to get answers to questions, and I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate. I also found that some of the explanations I've gotten do not hang together. So in a sense, I have more questions today than when I first started.\"\n\nBarr's comments come as he has asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation as more details continue to emerge. The most recent revelations involve former FBI Director James Comey, former Director of Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan, who reportedly used the unverified Steele dossier \u2013 opposition research paid for by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2013 in an effort to discredit President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) recently told Fox News that whoever is investigating the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation should \"look for emails between Brennan and Comey in December of 2016.\"\n\nOne of the key questions that remains unanswered is who directed former FBI Director James Comey to brief President-elect Trump on the most salacious aspect of the dossier \u2013 the prostitutes in Moscow \u2013 in early January 2016? And who then leaked that information to the media, which ran with the story?\n\nComey told Fox News last year that his mission in his private briefing with Trump was \"just to tell him about that slice of it.\" It's not clear who directed that \"mission,\" but Comey said he was in the room when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed then-President Obama about the dossier. Clapper now works as a contributor for CNN.\n\nIn his January 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower, Comey said he did not explain that the dossier was opposition research, and he said he did not know who leaked it to the press, nor did he ever try to find out. Comey said President-elect Trump called him after word of the dossier leaked.\n\nWhen asked by Fox News' Bret Baier if he informed the president-elect, at the time, what he knew about how it was funded and who was behind it, Comey replied, \"No.\" Baier also asked Comey if he told Trump that the unverified dossier had been used, at least in part, to get a FISA warrant to spy on someone in the Trump campaign. Baier also asked Comey if it was fair to say that President Obama and his inner circle knew a lot more about the dossier and the scope of the investigation than President Elect Trump and his team. \"No,\" Comey said. \"I don't think that's fair at all.\"",
    " Title: Lawmakers Express Doubts Over IRS's Capability to Administer Obamacare Amidst Trust Gap and Technical Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle expressed concerns about the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) ability to manage the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The doubts stem from the rocky rollout of the health exchanges last year, the IRS's tarnished reputation following the tea party targeting scandal, and the complexity of the task at hand.\n\nRepublicans argue that the trust gap between the IRS and the American public has widened due to these factors. For their part, Democrats question the public's understanding of their obligations under the healthcare law.\n\nRep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat, stated, \"I suspect that most folks, after they sign up for health care, aren't going back to review the website\u2014they've figured that they've done that, and they're getting on with the other things in their life.\"\n\nIn the coming year, Americans will face the issue when they file their tax returns for the first time and will need to certify whether they had health insurance. While many will simply check a box, those who received tax credits to help pay for insurance on the health exchanges will need to reconcile their subsidy payments, which were based on expected income, with their actual earnings.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen acknowledged the need for adjustments, stating, \"We've been trying to continually remind people to make that adjustment.\"\n\nThe IRS is also responsible for enforcing the law's individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance unless they have a specific exemption. Mr. Koskinen assured the House Ways and Means Committee's health panel that his agency would handle the workload, despite Congress not providing additional funding.\n\nHowever, House Republicans questioned the IRS's impartiality, particularly in light of revelations that top officials in the tea party targeting scandal appeared to have a bias against Republicans. Rep. Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican, demanded, \"What are the things that are happening proactively to prevent the next Lois Lerner\u2014Lois Lerner 2.0\u2014from looking out over a landscape with a high level of discretion to be able to say, \u2018You know what? We're going to make inquiries here, and we're going to make inquiries there, and we're not to make inquiries over here,' and you see where I'm going.\"\n\nLois Lerner, the former director of the IRS's Office of Exempt Organizations, became the face of the scandal last year when she admitted her division used inappropriate criteria to scrutinize political groups seeking tax-exempt status. Since then, the IRS has said it lost a set of Ms. Lerner's emails that could be relevant to the investigation.\n\nRep. Roskam's concerns about the IRS's technical capabilities were echoed by other lawmakers, with questions being raised about the same IT personnel who are responsible for administering Obamacare's provisions next year.\n\nMr. Koskinen stated that the IRS's auditing system prevents any one employee from singling out a specific taxpayer. However, his response to questions about subsidy overpayments collection may have undermined lawmakers' confidence in the agency when he remarked, \"Wherever we can, we follow the law.\"\n\nPanel Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, responded, \"I encourage you to follow the law in all instances.\"\n\nThe commissioner suggested that Congress could help the IRS carry out its new duties by providing an additional $430 million during the budget process, including $300 million needed to build systems that would allow the IRS to administer its share of Obamacare.\n\nRep. William J. Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, accused House Republicans of withholding funding as part of an uphill effort to dismantle Obamacare. \"If you can't shoot the dog, starve it,\" he said. \"That's what this is all about.\"",
    " Title: Janay Rice Defends Husband Ray Rice, Criticizes Media Handling of Domestic Violence Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heartfelt Instagram post on Tuesday, Janay Rice, the wife of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, defended her husband and criticized the media for its handling of the domestic violence incident that led to his release from the team and indefinite suspension by the NFL.\n\n\"I woke up this morning, feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I'm mourning the death of my closest friend,\" Janay Rice wrote. \"But to have to accept the fact that it's reality is a nightmare itself.\"\n\nRay Rice, 27, who was one of the top running backs in the National Football League, was released by the Ravens on Monday and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after a video surfaced showing him punching Janay, then his fianc\u00e9e, and knocking her out in the elevator of a New Jersey casino in February.\n\nThe video, which went viral when it surfaced on Monday, shook the NFL and even prompted a statement from the White House on domestic violence. Earlier video of the incident showed Rice dragging an unconscious Janay from the elevator, and in July he was suspended for two games by the league and fined $500,000.\n\nBut after video surfaced on Monday of him punching Janay inside the elevator, her head hitting a rail before she crumpled to the floor, Rice was cut from the team and suspended indefinitely by the NFL.\n\n\"No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family,\" Janay Rice wrote on Instagram. \"To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday is a horrible thing.\"\n\nThe NFL said it had not seen the new video until Monday, when it was released by the website TMZ. But TMZ said on Tuesday sources \"connected\" with the Revel Hotel and Casino said no one from the NFL asked for the video from inside the elevator.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell admitted he \"didn't get it right\" when he initially suspended Rice for two games and has strengthened the sanctions for NFL players who commit domestic violence.\n\nJanay Rice, who married Ray Rice shortly after the casino incident, accused the media of using the episode to \"gain ratings.\"\n\n\"THIS IS OUR LIFE! What don't you all get,\" she wrote. \"If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels.\"\n\n\"Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is! Ravensnation we love you!\" she added.\n\nRice was indicted by a grand jury in March on third-degree aggravated assault but the charge was dropped because Janay declined to testify against him. He agreed to court-supervised counseling.\n\nRice had his worst NFL season last year, and it remained unclear if he will ever play again.\n\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday anyone who saw the video would be \"outraged and really disgusted.\" He praised Goodell's handling of the situation, saying the commissioner had no knowledge of the second video before its release Monday, and for setting a clear policy of proper conduct in the NFL.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama \"believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society.\"",
    " Title: Senators Lankford and Sasse Reflect on the Evolution of the Abortion Debate in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the ongoing debate on abortion remains a contentious and deeply personal issue. As the anniversary of Roe v. Wade approaches, Senators James Lankford of Oklahoma and Ben Sasse of Nebraska reflect on the nation's evolving perspective on this sensitive topic.\n\nThe senators acknowledge the emotional impact of abortion on thousands of families, with many lives lost, families broken, and scars left behind. As science advances, the understanding of the developing fetus has become clearer, revealing the fingers, toes, beating heart, functioning nervous system, and unique DNA of the child within the womb.\n\nIn 2014, the American people elected a new Senate majority, which includes a strong pro-life stance. This summer, the nation was shocked by undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood's trafficking of fetal tissue from aborted babies. The videos led to a bill to redirect Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding to community health centers across the nation. Although the bill fell short of the required three-fifths majority in the Senate, it marked significant progress in the pro-life movement.\n\nSince 2011, the Senate has seen a 13-vote swing in favor of protecting life, demonstrating the growing support for pro-life policies. In 2015, the Senate was successful in passing a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, only to have it vetoed by President Obama.\n\nThe senators highlight the stark difference between the current and previous Senates on the issue of life, with the 110th through 113th Congresses seeing efforts to devalue human life versus those to protect it. The senators express gratitude for the rising generation's growing pro-life sentiment and for the millions of Americans who believe in protecting all life.\n\nThe senators emphasize that the issue is complex, but technological advancements have opened the eyes of many to the reality of life before birth and the procedures carried out in Planned Parenthood facilities across the country. They believe that a pregnancy is a child in the womb, not a meaningless blob of tissue.\n\nIn their conclusion, Senators Lankford and Sasse express their gratitude for the non-political conversations Americans have around the issue of life and for the counselors and advocates who serve women facing unplanned pregnancies. They look forward to the annual March for Life in Washington D.C., where they will stand shoulder to shoulder with those who speak up for life.",
    " Title: Bridging the Political Divide: A Call for Understanding and Listening Among Progressives and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political climate, it is not uncommon for individuals on opposite ends of the political spectrum to find themselves at odds, particularly among progressives and conservatives. A recent conversation between a self-proclaimed progressive and a Donald Trump voter has led to a call for a shift in tactics among progressives, emphasizing the importance of understanding, empathy, and open dialogue.\n\nThe progressive, in reflecting on the conversation, acknowledged that their typical response to conservatives - labeling them as smug, elitist hypocrites for not being tolerant of their beliefs - was misguided. Instead, they argued that it is crucial to understand the roots of conservative beliefs and the cultural shifts that have caused tension between the two sides.\n\nThe progressive's friend, a Trump voter, was described as someone who cherishes traditional American values, such as small-town America, baseball, and apple pie. To them, the progressive movement, with its emphasis on political correctness and intersectionalism, is perceived as an attack on these deeply held feelings of what America represents. They fear that the cultural shifts of recent decades are eroding the America they hold dear.\n\nThe progressive acknowledged that labeling Trump voters as bigots, racists, or monsters would not change their perspective. Instead, they argued that progressives must respectfully suggest that their causes align with the patriotism and love for America that conservatives hold. By emphasizing shared values and the desire for a better America for all, progressives can engage in meaningful dialogue and work towards a common goal.\n\nThe progressive also called for progressives to put aside their anger and hate, and to take responsibility for creating the change they wish to see in the world. They argued that vilifying, shaming, and condemning conservatives only causes them to dig in their heels, and that progressives must be willing to guide others through the process of change.\n\nIn conclusion, the progressive urged their fellow progressives to stop insulting, shaming, and condescending conservatives, and instead to listen and teach. By understanding and empathizing with the perspectives of conservatives, progressives can work towards bridging the political divide and creating a more inclusive, understanding, and united America.\n\nAndrew Redlawsk, a Democratic organizer and activist, and Sophia Buono, a Trump voter, shared their perspectives on the matter.

    " Title: CBO's Predictions on Obamacare: A Closer Look at the Congressional Budget Office's Estimates and Their Accuracy\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been under scrutiny recently due to claims by the White House that it was \"way, way off\" in its predictions about the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). However, a closer examination of the CBO's predictions reveals that the organization was not significantly off in its overall impact assessment of the law on the uninsured.\n\nThe CBO accurately predicted a significant drop in the percentage of people under the age of 65 who would lack insurance. In 2016, the non-elderly rate was 10.3%, which is close to the CBO's prediction of 11%. The CBO's overestimation of the number of people who would obtain government-subsidized coverage through the new insurance exchanges and underestimation of those who would gain coverage through expanding Medicaid contributed to the discrepancies in its predictions.\n\nIn 2012, the CBO issued its official estimate of the cost and effects of the Affordable Care Act. After the Supreme Court's ruling in July 2012, the CBO updated its estimates to account for the court's decision. The CBO attempted to forecast the law's effects in each of the following 10 years, and its predictions for 2016 were compared with actual results.\n\nThe CBO's overall prediction was accurate, as millions of people gained coverage, and millions did. The CBO predicted that 89% of the non-elderly would be covered in 2016, and the actual percentage was 89.7%. The CBO's mistake was in predicting the number of newly insured who would obtain coverage through the exchanges, not in the overall number of people who would gain coverage.\n\nIn January 2016, the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund published an analysis by New York University's Sherry Glied of CBO's forecast of the ACA's effects. Glied found that CBO's predictions were \"reasonably accurate\" compared with actual results in 2014. The gap between CBO's prediction and reality has widened now that 2016 figures are available for comparison. However, Glied also found that CBO's predictions were closer to 2014 reality than those of four other forecasters.\n\nIn conclusion, the CBO's predictions for the Affordable Care Act were relatively accurate, and its estimates were closer to reality than those of other prominent forecasters. The discrepancies in the CBO's predictions were primarily due to the organization's inability to accurately predict where the uninsured would obtain coverage, not the overall number of people who would gain coverage.",
    " Title: Power, Corruption, and the Pursuit of Status: A Look at Government Officials and the Misuse of Office\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the halls of power, the question of whether power corrupts is often a topic of discussion. The recent testimony of EPA administrator Scott Pruitt on Capitol Hill has brought this question to the forefront once again. The idea that power, money, fame, authority, or a combination of these factors can lower the cost of indulging human nature is a central point of debate.\n\nHuman nature is not just about carnal desires and personal indulgences. It also involves the desire for status, and the more status some people have, the more they crave, along with the trappings that come with it. This desire for status can lead to questionable behavior, as seen in the recent request by televangelist Jesse Duplantis for his congregation to donate $54 million for a private jet, or in the case of celebrities who demand special treatment from their staff.\n\nGovernment officials, in particular, are under scrutiny when they abuse their authority for personal gain. The Trump White House, with its high concentration of wealthy individuals, has come under fire for instances of such behavior. For example, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who flies on her own private jet, is saving taxpayers money and is secure in her status, unlike some of her colleagues.\n\nHowever, DeVos and other wealthy members of the administration have been accused of arousing envy in their colleagues, most notably Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has been praised for his work in reducing regulations and fulfilling conservative goals, but he has also been criticized for petty and silly behavior, such as using his aides to get a discount on a used mattress and sending his grandiosely praetorian security detail to fetch him special hand lotion.\n\nSimilarly, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who has long talked about the dangers of big government, has been accused of treating his cabinet appointment as a kind of ducal fiefdom, rewarding his family with business opportunities and blaming his wife when he was caught exceeding the budget for interior decorating.\n\nThe perks of working in government are inherent to the job, not to the person holding it. Under President Obama, it was a staple of conservative rhetoric to note that America is not a monarchy. While they still say it, they don't always act like it. The misuse of power for personal gain is a concern that transcends political parties and highlights the need for accountability and transparency in government.",
    " Title: Connecticut, New York, California, and Illinois Face Mounting Debt Crises, Former Governor Warns of Potential Taxpayer Bailouts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark reminder of the financial challenges faced by some of the nation's most populous states, four heavily Democratic-leaning states - Connecticut, New York, California, and Illinois - are grappling with significant debt crises. The former governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, has warned that taxpayers could potentially be forced to bail out these states, as their pension obligations mount.\n\nConnecticut, often recognized as one of the wealthiest states per capita, has accumulated a debt of over $53 billion, according to Daniels. In an interview with FOX Business' Stuart Varney, he expressed concern that the taxpayers, already burdened in some of these states, could be the ones to foot the bill.\n\nConnecticut is not alone in its financial struggles. California, Illinois, and New Jersey are also facing difficulties in making pension payments to retired government workers. In Illinois, for instance, vendors often wait months for payment from a government that is $30 billion in debt, and whose bonds are just one notch above junk bond status, according to Daniels.\n\nCalifornia's debt stands at over $356 billion, while New Jersey's debt exceeds $104 billion. California's debt is the highest among the four states, followed by New York and New Jersey. California's debt is more than four times the debt of Connecticut, and New York's debt is nearly three times that of Connecticut.\n\nThe debt crises in these states highlight the long-term financial challenges they face, as a result of decades of fiscal irresponsibility. The situation, as Daniels puts it, is akin to someone going to a barbershop, with taxpayers being the first to be affected. This \"blue state madness\" is a concern that will likely continue to dominate discussions on fiscal policy in the coming years.",
    " Title: State Insurance Regulators Face Uncertainty Over Obama's Healthcare Policy Change\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's recent announcement of a one-year extension for insurance policies that do not comply with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has left state-level insurance commissioners and companies in a state of confusion, unsure of how to implement the change, if at all, at this late stage.\n\nIn a statement, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) expressed their concerns, stating, \"For three years, state insurance regulators have been working to adapt to the Affordable Care Act in a way that best meets the needs of consumers in each state. It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed by the president can be put into effect.\"\n\nThe announcement, made on Thursday, was intended to address the concerns of millions of Americans who have lost their current insurance plans due to the ACA's minimum standards. These individuals were being offered new plans or sent to the troubled insurance exchanges, but in many cases, were faced with more expensive options.\n\nHowever, the president's change, as well as a broader plan approved in the House on Friday, could cause chaos for insurance companies and state commissioners. The meeting with insurance industry executives on Friday, which included representatives from Aetna, Humana, Tufts Health Plan Foundation, and Health Care Service Corporation, was expected to address these concerns.\n\nThe main complaints are that changing the rules at this stage and allowing people to renew cheaper, lower-premium policies will disrupt the financial balance that the industry was trying to strike, likely resulting in higher premiums for others.\n\n\"Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace,\" America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) President and CEO Karen Ignagni said in a statement. \"If now fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase and there will be fewer choices for consumers.\"\n\nIn addition to the financial implications, there are logistical matters to consider. Companies would need to reach out to customers who have already received cancellation notices, and insurance commissioners would need to reassess rates and plans for 2014, which had already been set.\n\nIn states such as Washington and Oklahoma, insurance commissioners are already balking at this task. Washington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler stated within hours of Obama's announcement that his state would not be making any changes. Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John D. Doak criticized the president's decision, stating, \"How can the federal government make this decision without offering any guidance to the state insurance departments or the insurance carriers? Cancellation notices have already gone out. Rates and plans have already been approved. How is this supposed to work?\"\n\nIn state after state, where typically hundreds of thousands of cancellation notices have been sent out, insurance commissioners are struggling to figure out how they might implement the administration's sudden change.\n\nSome argue that the president is making this announcement to shift the burden and blame to insurance companies and state commissioners. If people cannot renew their policies after the administrative \"fix,\" then the president could argue that he tried, and was stymied by the states.\n\nRepublicans also argue that Obama may not even be in his right to do this administratively. That's why they called a vote Friday afternoon on a bill that would do what Obama proposes administratively\u2014and then some. The GOP-backed bill would not only let people extend their plans for another year, but also let other individuals who did not have such coverage opt to enroll in those plans as well. Obama has threatened to veto the bill.\n\nAs for the president's plan, Wendell Potter, a former executive at Cigna, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that some insurance companies might take up the president on his offer in order to make money off those policy holders. He said the main reason the administration is doing this is because the federal exchanges are not working. Eventually, he said, \"I think it probably will, and people will start when it does work find out that there are better policies.\"",
    " Title: Cruz and O'Rourke Debate in Texas: A Closer Look at the Second Debate Between the Senate Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the second debate of a surprisingly close race, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his challenger, Beto O'Rourke, showcased their political differences while maintaining a relatively civil discourse, focusing on their respective agendas rather than personal attacks. The debate, which primarily addressed domestic issues, delved into topics such as taxes, U.S. policy on climate change, immigration, judicial philosophy, and healthcare.\n\nSen. Cruz, the Republican incumbent in the conservative state, emphasized his desire to cut taxes and maintain the current economic boom, while O'Rourke presented himself as a moderate Democrat advocating for universal healthcare. O'Rourke also sought to portray himself as a bipartisan collaborator, stating, \"I want people to have more health care.\"\n\nIn their first debate, O'Rourke was within striking distance of Cruz, and one poll even gave him a 1-point lead. However, the polls have since trended in Cruz's favor, with the incumbent currently holding a 7-point advantage in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Despite this, O'Rourke remains a formidable opponent, being much closer than any other Democrat in a statewide race in the GOP-dominated Lone Star State.\n\nThroughout the debate, O'Rourke was more assertive than in their first encounter, often challenging Cruz's positions. Cruz, in turn, repeatedly highlighted O'Rourke's support for impeaching President Trump, a position O'Rourke has been careful not to express in either debate.\n\nThe candidates also addressed various other issues, including O'Rourke's vote against a relief bill for Hurricane Harvey victims, Cruz's stance on the deficit, and the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Both candidates used the debate to emphasize their contrasting views on these topics, with Cruz highlighting his role in Kavanaugh's confirmation and O'Rourke reiterating his opposition to the appointment.\n\nThe O'Rourke campaign entered the debate following a record-breaking fundraising quarter, raising $38.1 million. O'Rourke attributed this success to his broad appeal and his commitment to representing all Texans, while Cruz countered that much of O'Rourke's funds have come from donors outside the state, attracted by a brand of liberalism more common in left-wing coastal areas.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the race between Cruz and O'Rourke continues to garner intense national interest, with Democrats hoping to retake Congress. The debate offered a glimpse into the stark differences between the two candidates, and the race remains a closely watched contest in the Lone Star State.",
    " Title: National Security Concerns and Comprehensive Immigration Reform: A Call for Enhanced Screening and Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, the focus has shifted towards the long-standing weaknesses in the United States' national security system, particularly in relation to immigration and visa policies. As the nation grapples with the tragedy, it is crucial that Congress addresses these issues in the ongoing debate over comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nThe recent events have raised questions about how two individuals, who allegedly committed acts of terrorism, were able to immigrate from a known hotbed of Islamic extremism, the Chechen Republic in Russia. The questions that arise are: Were there any safeguards in place? Could this have been prevented?\n\nThe immigration and visa system should provide more scrutiny to individuals from high-risk areas of the world. The flawed visa system was a significant part of the intelligence failure that led to the Sept. 11 attacks, as noted by National Review's Kevin Williamson. If the law enforcement and intelligence agencies, particularly the State Department, had been doing a minimally competent job vis-a-vis visa overstays and application screening, at least 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 would have been caught.\n\nAfter Sept. 11, there was comprehensive reform of the intelligence-gathering system, but our current system still did not adequately detect these latest extremists. It has been reported that both suspects were legal permanent residents, one was a naturalized citizen, and the other was on the path to becoming a citizen. The details of their immigration process, as well as any suspicious activities, should be thoroughly investigated.\n\nThe current immigration and visa system should be reevaluated to prevent similar incidents in the future. The National Security Registration System, created in 2002 and suspended in 2011, should be revisited and reinstituted. This system, which provided extra screening for immigrants from nations that have a higher population of extremists, is a necessary part of any comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nIn addition, there should be increased scrutiny when accepting refugees from high-risk nations. The case of the Iraqi citizens sentenced in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for participating in terrorism and providing material support to terrorists while living in the United States, highlights the need for more vigilance.\n\nFurthermore, student visas should be examined, and visas from high-risk areas should be suspended pending an investigation into the national security implications of this program. Any new legislation must address the visa entry and exit programs, in addition to refugee programs that have proven problematic.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees. He, along with other lawmakers, should work towards ensuring that the federal government is doing everything it can to prevent would-be terrorists from using a flawed immigration system against the United States. These national security concerns must be a part of the comprehensive immigration-reform debate.",
    " Title: Florida State University Students Shot in Library Incident; Gunman Identified as Alumnus and Lawyer\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, three Florida State University (FSU) students were shot and wounded inside the Strozier Library early Thursday morning. The gunman, identified as Myron May, a Florida State alumnus and a lawyer, was also killed by police.\n\nAccording to a law enforcement official who requested anonymity, Myron May, a graduate of Florida State before attending Texas Tech University's law school, was the shooter. David Taunton, who runs a foster home in the Florida Panhandle, told FoxNews.com that May had stayed at a guest house in a rural area for the past three weeks.\n\nTaunton, who knew May through his sons who ran track together in high school, described May as \"a good kid as it gets.\" May was back in the area to study for an exam and seemed normal until he disappeared Friday night after dinner with his grandmother, Taunton said.\n\nThe shooting occurred at about 12:30 a.m. when the armed suspect walked into the Tallahassee building and opened fire. Witnesses reported several gunshots and a chaotic scene. FSU Police Chief David Perry described the incident, stating, \"This person just for whatever reason produced a handgun and then began shooting students in the library.\"\n\nSean Young, a student at the school who was on the third floor of the building, told WCTV.tv that students ran past him and some took refuge in a private study room rented by a fraternity. \"My first instinct was to remain calm and try to keep the people around me calm as well,\" he said.\n\nSarah Evans, another student from the school, from Miami, was inside the library and heard a male student say he had been shot. When she looked at him, he was on the ground with blood spreading on his pants leg.\n\nThe unidentified suspect made his way outside to the entrance of the building. He was confronted by campus police who ordered him to drop his weapon. The gunman disregarded the order and fired a shot at the officers. Police returned fire and fatally hit the man.\n\nHours after the shooting, detectives could be seen inspecting the body of the suspected gunman, who was lying face down at the top of an access ramp just outside the library. A gray baseball cap lay near his head.\n\nWCTV.tv reported that all three victims were located around the library. The report said one student is in critical condition, another is stable, and one was treated at the scene and released. Police did not say if the wounded were shot by the gunman.\n\nTallahassee Memorial HealthCare said as of 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the condition of the patients had not changed.\n\nIn a press conference Thursday morning, police assured that the shooting was an isolated incident, and there is no further threat on campus. University officials said campus will remain open Thursday, but all classes are canceled.\n\nA nursing supervisor at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare told the Associated Press that the hospital was treating two people for gunshot wounds early Thursday.\n\nShortly after 4 a.m., a loud tone sounded across the campus followed by an announcement that the campus was \"all clear.\"\n\nDavid Sillick, the publisher of Jacksonville Business Journal, told FoxNews.com that he received a text message from his daughter during the shooting, saying, \"There's a man with a gun in the library. I love you.\" She called a few minutes later to say police were at the scene and clearing out the floors, and she was fine.\n\n\"We didn't know what was happening so I monitored Twitter,\" Sillick said. \"A message like that is every parent's worst fear.\"\n\nHours later, detectives could be seen inspecting the body of the alleged gunman. He was lying face down at the top of the access ramp just outside the library.\n\nA telephone alert from the university urged people to stay away from doors and windows. The alert provided no details of what sparked the warning. FSUNews.com reported that students were on lockdown in a second library and in the university dormitories.\n\nFlorida State President John Thrasher, who took office earlier this month, said in a statement Thursday, \"The community is saddened by the events. The three students who have been injured are our highest priority followed by the needs of our greater university community. We will do everything possible to assist with their recovery.\"",
    " Title: Partisan Divide Persists as U.S. Marks 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the nation's capital this week, the fiftieth anniversary of the historic March on Washington is being commemorated with separate events by both Republicans and Democrats, reflecting a persistent partisan divide on issues of race in America.\n\nFifty years since Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" address, which became a pivotal moment in the struggle for civil rights in the U.S., a new national poll indicates a divide between the two parties on whether King's dream has been achieved. Political issues that involve race, including voting rights and high minority unemployment, continue to split Americans along party lines.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey released last week, 49% of Americans say that \"a lot more\" needs to be done to achieve King's dream, with just over three in ten saying \"some more\" needs to be done and 16% saying little or nothing needs to be accomplished.\n\nThe poll reveals a stark contrast between Democrats and Republicans on the question. Thirty-five percent of Republicans surveyed say \"a lot more\" needs to be done to reach racial equality. This number jumps to 63% among Democrats questioned in the survey, which was conducted in early August.\n\nLouisiana's Republican Governor Bobby Jindal, who made history in 2008 as the first Indian-American to serve as governor in the country's history, wrote in Politico on Monday that, despite the progress made on racial equality since King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, there remains a sense of division among Americans.\n\n\"We still place far too much emphasis on our'separateness,' our heritage, ethnic background, skin color, etc.,\" he wrote. \"We live in the age of hyphenated Americans: Asian-Americans, Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Indian-Americans, and Native Americans, to name just a few. Here's an idea: How about just 'Americans?'\"\n\n\"We are all created in the image of God \u2013 skinny, fat, tall, short, dark, light, whatever. Who cares? What does it matter? It's time to get over it,\" he continued. \"It's time for the end of race in America. Now that would be progress.\"\n\nJindal's essay comes as Republican and Democratic politicians hold separate events to mark the anniversary of King's speech and the March on Washington, which in 1963 drew hundreds of thousands of Americans to the National Mall in Washington.\n\nA Saturday rally, organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network along with Martin Luther King III and the NAACP, featured speeches from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, as well as Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who now serves as a Democratic congressman representing parts of Atlanta.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder and Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the Garden State, also spoke.\n\nOn Wednesday, which will be 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, President Barack Obama will deliver remarks at a rally in the same spot. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will also attend and address the crowd.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush was invited to attend, but declined since he's recovering from a heart procedure earlier this summer. Bush had a stent placed in his heart on August 6 and left the hospital a day later.\n\nNo Republicans are slated to speak at the Wednesday event. Instead, the Republican National Committee is hosting a luncheon on Monday to commemorate the anniversary that features the party's chairman Reince Priebus and prominent African-American Republicans, including T.W. Shannon, the speaker of Oklahoma's state House of Representatives, and former Rep. Allen West of Florida, who lost his bid for re-election last year.\n\n\"I think the RNC and chairman Priebus' timing on commemorating that event was well worth it,\" Shannon said on CNN later Monday. \"If you look at the attendance that we had, we had people from all walks of life that came to the luncheon to participate to recognize that not only are we honoring the man, but we were honoring an idea.\"\n\nAlso attending the event was Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who's been a leading GOP voice on rewriting portions of the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court gutted its key provisions in June.\n\nSaying the court had \"thrown a monkey wrench\" into the law, he said it was lawmakers' responsibility to fix it.\n\nRepublican lawmakers also marked the march's anniversary in July, before leaving for August's recess, with an event in the U.S. Capitol led by House Speaker John Boehner.",
    " Title: A Century of Dialogue: The Evolution of Meetings Between U.S. Presidents and Popes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe meeting between Pope Francis and President Obama at the White House continues a tradition going back nearly a century between U.S. presidents and the head of the Roman Catholic Church. The talks are private, often personal, and always take place against the backdrop of the politics of the time. This tradition was initiated during the aftermath of World War I, with the first such meeting taking place at the Vatican between President Woodrow Wilson and Pope Benedict XV.\n\nIn January of 1919, President Woodrow Wilson was on a tour of Europe that lasted more than six months. The main purpose of the trip was the Paris Peace Conference, but Wilson's itinerary included Italy, as well. Initially, there was no plan to visit Pope Benedict XV, a pontiff who was deeply involved in ways the church could help Europe rebuild and emerge from the darkness and destruction of the war years. However, at the suggestion of an American cardinal, Wilson did go to the Vatican for an audience with Benedict.\n\nThey discussed the recovery effort, but politics were in the back of Wilson's mind as well. According to the Rev. Matt Malone, editor of America, a magazine put out by the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church, Malone notes the growing working-class Catholic population in U.S. cities at the time. \"You're beginning to see Catholics, who were basically European immigrants, as a force within the Democrat Party,\" Malone says. \"And it was absolutely a part of the political calculation.\"\n\nWilson's Vatican stop also included the first awkward moment between a president and a pope. At the end of the meeting, an aide told Benedict it was time for him to bless the group, but Wilson, a Presbyterian, was not interested in being blessed. He turned to his staff and asked if there were any Catholics present. There were. The Catholics knelt as the pope blessed those present. Wilson remained standing.\n\nIt would be 40 years before another president would visit the Vatican. That would be Dwight D. Eisenhower, who met with John XXIII. There were reasons for the gap\u2014the Great Depression and World War II, for example. But there was also a persistent anti-Catholic bias in the U.S. That's something candidate John F. Kennedy had to address in his 1960 campaign. He was asked about it by reporters and delivered a speech to put to rest worries that he'd be a tool of the pope.\n\n\"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,\" Kennedy said. \"Where no Catholic prelate would tell the president, should he be Catholic, how to act.\" Kennedy was\u2014and remains\u2014the only president who was Catholic. He, too, traveled to Rome and Vatican City as president, his motorcade driving past huge throngs of onlookers who crowded the sidewalks.\n\nIt was July 1963, barely four months before JFK's assassination, and for many American Catholics, it was a proud moment of reaffirmation of their faith and pride in their country. It was a relatively new pontiff Kennedy met that day, as Pope Paul VI had been coronated just two weeks earlier following the death of his predecessor.\n\nTwo years later, Paul VI would become the first pope to visit the U.S., traveling to New York City, where he met with President Lyndon B. Johnson. Since then, every U.S. president has met with the pope, but it wasn't until 1979 that a pontiff visited the White House. Jimmy Carter was in office and welcomed John Paul II, calling him \"our new friend.\"\n\n\"The people of our country have waited a long time for this meeting,\" Carter said. Malone said this was perhaps the most important of all of the meetings between presidents and popes. Both were men of deep Christian faith. John Paul and Carter hit it off. The session also helped make possible the opening of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vatican five years later.\n\nJohn Paul II, \"committed anti-communist and Cold Warrior,\" meets Reagan\nMost important, in even that first meeting with Carter, is what was on the pope's mind, according to Malone. \"John Paul II was a committed anti-communist and Cold Warrior,\" Malone said. \"He already had in mind that he wanted to enlist himself in the struggle to free the world of communism.\"\n\nBy 1981, the U.S. had a new president, Ronald Reagan. He was eager to join the young, charismatic pope in that effort. On a papal visit to the U.S. in 1987, Reagan was there to greet the pontiff as his plane landed in Miami, extolling John Paul's life and work.\n\n\"In Poland, you experienced Nazism and communism,\" Reagan said. \"As pope, you suffered a terrorist attack that nearly claimed your life. Still, you proclaim that the central message of our time is not hatred but love.\"\n\nIn 27 years, John Paul held more than a dozen meetings with U.S. presidents. One of the most famous\u2014and most uncomfortable for an American leader\u2014came late in his life, in 2004 with George W. Bush. The setting was the Vatican, and the pope was opposed to the U.S. war in Iraq. In an ornate ceremonial hall, John Paul and President Bush sat side by side, the pope clearly infirmed because of advanced Parkinson's disease, his hands shaking, his voice halting and barely intelligible, as he read a statement in English.\n\nIt was hard to make out exactly what the pope was saying because of his ailment, but the message was clear\u2014a strong condemnation of the war. \"It is the evident desire of everyone that this situation now be normalized as quickly as possible with the active participation of the international community and, in particular, the United Nations organization, in order to ensure a speedy return of Iraq's sovereignty, in conditions of security for all its people,\" John Paul said.\n\nHe also seemed to refer to then-recent revelations of the abuse of prisoners by U.S. personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison. \"In the past few weeks, other deplorable events have come to light, which have troubled the civic and religious conscience of all,\" the pope said. Despite the criticism, Bush later spoke warmly about the pope. \"For those of you who have ever met him, you know, I'm telling you the truth when I tell you, being in his presence is an awesome experience,\" Bush said.\n\nNo president finds a pope who agrees with him on everything. That's true of Obama and Francis, too. But the relationship between popes and presidents is seen as important by both sides.",
    " Title: The Paradox of American Healthcare: A Look at the Unseen Subsidies and Public Perception\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the intricate landscape of American politics, understanding the nuances of healthcare policy is a daunting task. A recent Economist/YouGov poll sheds light on this challenge, revealing a disconnect between the policy community and the general public's understanding of healthcare subsidies.\n\nThe poll indicates that despite the significant role government plays in providing health insurance, many Americans remain unaware of this fact. The majority of insured Americans in the United States receive some form of government assistance, be it Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the disabled and the poor, or tax subsidies for employer-provided health insurance for full-time workers.\n\nThis misunderstanding is not entirely due to ignorance. Older Americans, for instance, may not fully comprehend the nature of Medicare, often believing they have paid for their benefits through earlier taxes. However, the misconception extends to those with job-based insurance as well.\n\nThe existence of the tax subsidy for employer-provided health insurance is hidden from sight but is a substantial part of the American health care system. When an employer pays an employee in health insurance, the employee does not have to pay income taxes on it. This tax-exempt status makes it efficient for employers to offer health insurance as part of their compensation package.\n\nThis system works well for employees of large companies due to the large risk pools they provide. However, it falls short for the self-employed, small businesses, contractors, part-time workers, and others who cannot spread the cost of caring for an individual sick person across a large group of mostly healthy people.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act aims to address this issue by creating a parallel system of subsidies for those without job-based care and by paring back the tax subsidy for the most expensive job-based plans. However, the public's understanding of these subsidies remains limited, with the healthcare policy debate often appearing as a debate about the Loch Ness Monster to many Americans.\n\nPolicy experts from various ideological backgrounds agree that it is arbitrary and unfair to provide this subsidy to employees of large companies while other workers go unsubsidized and uncovered. The Affordable Care Act and many conservative plans, such as those proposed by John McCain and the current congressional trio of Richard Burr, Orrin Hatch, and Fred Upton, aim to level the playing field by eliminating or curtailing the subsidy for job-based plans.\n\nAvik Roy, a prominent conservative health policy analyst, refers to this subsidy as the \"original sin\" of American health care policy. As the debate continues, it is crucial to bridge the gap between policy experts and the general public, ensuring a more informed and productive discourse on healthcare reform.",
    " Title: Rep. Devin Nunes Expresses Concern Over Tech Giants' Alleged Bias Against Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 this weekend, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, voiced his concerns about the alleged censorship of conservatives by tech giants such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others. Nunes, who is currently suing Twitter in Virginia, stated that the company has been the \"worst\" in terms of bias against conservatives.\n\nNunes argued that the tech companies have been able to avoid lawsuits due to a special \"carveout\" in federal law that treats them as open public squares, rather than products like cars or kitchen appliances. He claimed that the tech companies have been negligent in the operation of their properties and have operated them as content developers.\n\nNunes pointed out that the tech giants have allegedly warped their products to push a certain ideology rather than being open platforms since President Donald Trump's election in 2016. He stated that the companies are now regulating content and deciding how to regulate it, with a clear bias against conservatives.\n\nNunes suggested that the easiest solution to this problem would be for the tech companies to return to being open platforms, but he does not have confidence that they will do so. He proposed that they should police their properties only when there is a breaking of a federal or state law. As for Google, he suggested that they should stop the bias in their search results.\n\nNunes also believes that the Democrats' talk of regulating or holding tech companies accountable is a \"fake threat,\" meant to intimidate them into becoming subservient to the left's agenda. Given that Democrats are in the majority in the House of Representatives, Nunes stated that there is \"nothing\" that Congress can do to combat the tech giants until after the 2020 election.\n\nNunes is currently suing Twitter in a Virginia state court, seeking to hold the company accountable for the smears, lies, fake accounts, and inaccurate attacks he has faced. He stated that the courts will be the fastest and only way to solve the problem before the 2020 election.",
    " Title: The New York Times' Portrayal of Hillary Clinton's Gender Advocacy Under Scrutiny: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article published on March 8, The New York Times portrayed Hillary Clinton as \"vulnerable\" on the subject of gender, primarily relying on Republican criticisms to question her commitment to women's rights. The criticism stems from the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from Middle Eastern countries with a history of gender discrimination.\n\nThe article, however, contradicts the suggested questionable track record of Clinton's advocacy for women's rights. The Times acknowledges that \"advancing women has been\" Clinton's \"central life's work.\" Despite the Republican attacks, which include comments from Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard chief, and the Republican National Committee, the article highlights Clinton's emphasis on empowering women and girls during her tenure at the State Department.\n\nThe article cites Republican criticisms, such as the apparent contradiction between Clinton's tweets about women's rights and her acceptance of donations from countries that deny women basic human rights. The Republican National Committee also released a video featuring President Obama's statement on political donations from foreign sources as a threat to democracy, juxtaposed with images of Clinton with Middle Eastern leaders.\n\nHowever, the Times' own report undermines these criticisms. The article notes that, during her time at the State Department, Clinton emphasized how empowering women and girls could enhance economies, national security, and overall progress. Throughout her career, Hillary Clinton has consistently championed women's rights and leadership.\n\nMoreover, the article reveals that previous donations to the foundation have not deterred Clinton from vocally criticizing countries on gender discrimination. During her time as secretary of state, Clinton criticized Saudi Arabia, among other Arab leaders, for discriminating against women, despite the countries' previous donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while The New York Times' article portrays Hillary Clinton as facing criticism on gender issues, the article itself undermines the validity of these criticisms by highlighting Clinton's long-standing commitment to women's rights and her continued advocacy, even in the face of donations from countries with questionable records on gender equality.",
    " Title: Congress Stalemate Over Immigration Reform: House and Senate Disagree on Enforcement and Border Security\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress is currently at an impasse over immigration reform, with the Senate and House of Representatives unable to reach a consensus. The Senate passed a bill that has been criticized by the House for being too lenient on amnesty, allowing too much new immigration, and lacking sufficient enforcement, making it too costly for American workers. The Republican majority in the House argues that the first order of business should be strengthening enforcement and border security.\n\nAccording to data from the two main enforcement agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the House's stance appears to have merit. Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher recently disclosed at a conference that his agents arrested 420,000 illegal border crossers in 2013, marking the second consecutive year of increases and suggesting that a significant number of people are attempting to enter the country illegally through the southwest border, particularly in South Texas. This revelation has caused some consternation among Obama administration political appointees at DHS, who have yet to explain this discrepancy in their claims that illegal immigration is no longer a significant issue.\n\nInterior enforcement has also seen a sharp decline in recent years. Leaked internal statistics show that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are making fewer arrests of illegal aliens within the country, and removals from the interior have decreased more than 35% since 2009. Arrests have fallen in every region, with the most significant drops occurring in Georgia and the Carolinas, where 62% fewer illegal aliens were apprehended.\n\nExperts agree that the size of the illegal population has remained relatively stable for several years, hovering around 11.5 million. This figure includes nearly 900,000 individuals who have been ordered removed at least once but refuse to leave because no one is enforcing the order.\n\nThe Obama administration's claims of \"record\" deportations and \"smarter\" enforcement have been called into question. These claims have been a key talking point for proponents of amnesty and the Senate bill, which sought to weaken enforcement in numerous ways. Advocates for illegal aliens, including the newly legalized \"Dreamers,\" have taken to the streets and the halls of Congress, staging protests, confrontations, and even disrupting the lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree, demanding a halt to all deportations.\n\nInternal documents made public as part of a lawsuit by ICE officers against their own agency reveal that ICE has been inflating its deportation numbers by taking credit for removing tens of thousands of illegal border crossers who were arrested by Border Patrol. These individuals were held in ICE detention centers for just a few hours before being removed, accounting for about half of all deportations in the last two years.\n\nThis practice allows the administration to conceal the decline in interior arrests and give the impression that they are vigorously enforcing immigration laws. In 2013, ICE encountered more than 700,000 aliens who could have been removed (a record, thanks to new resources from Congress), most of whom were found in jails. However, ICE took action against fewer than 200,000, meaning that ICE is now releasing more illegal aliens\u2014including criminal aliens\u2014than it is arresting.\n\nThis deceptive practice is having a detrimental impact on public safety and the rule of law. As ICE fills its limited detention beds with illegal border crossers who could be more efficiently dealt with by Border Patrol, political leaders in Washington are instructing agents in the field to turn a blind eye to most illegal aliens living in our communities. Minor criminals, even chronic re-offenders, reckless or drunk drivers, those with families, those rejected for green cards, anyone claiming to have been brought as a child, and relatives of veterans are all considered off-limits for enforcement.\n\nThe official rationale for these policies, known as \"prosecutorial discretion,\" is to keep ICE agents focused on removing dangerous criminal aliens rather than \"harmless\" illegal workers. However, the number of criminal removals has also decreased due to the creation of numerous exceptions to the law. In North Carolina alone, authorities have lost track of more than 3,000 illegal alien ex-cons that ICE failed to remove. Inevitably, they will find new victims.\n\nThe Obama administration's deliberate suppression of immigration enforcement has understandably dampened enthusiasm among House Republicans for a comprehensive bill that must be passed to understand its contents. Instead, lawmakers should pass targeted measures to strengthen interior enforcement and restore credibility to the laws we have.\n\nJessica M. Vaughan is the Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based research institute.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney: A Paradoxical Figure in the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost the 2012 presidential election to President Barack Obama, has long been a paradox within the Republican Party. A man who, at first glance, appears to be the epitome of the country-club Republican, Romney's political career has been marked by a shift from moderate to severely conservative positions.\n\nRomney, who won the election in a traditionally blue state, was known as a bipartisan moderate in Massachusetts. However, on the national stage, he presented himself as a \"severely conservative\" candidate. This dichotomy is reflective of the Republican Party's own lack of ideological clarity, a factor that may have contributed to Romney's nomination.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, presented the first presidential ticket in history not to include a Protestant. Romney, a Mormon, and Ryan, a Catholic, faced a challenge in appealing to the party's conservative base while also attracting moderates and independents.\n\nRomney's campaign strategy was to take the tea party agenda and rebrand it to appeal to both the right and the center. However, his speeches were often criticized as flat and goofy, and his attire was seen as too sensible and wholesome. Yet, the GOP, in an era of recession, found Romney's business experience and polished-yet-gentle style appealing, particularly in contrast to Obama's flashy rhetoric.\n\nTo win the primaries, Romney underwent a rebranding, moving rhetorically further to the right to appeal to the conservative base. This shift, however, was not enough to win over the conservative movement, as Romney lost Iowa to Rick Santorum and South Carolina to Newt Gingrich.\n\nRomney's broader appeal was buried beneath a wave of scandal and political character assassination. It was during the debates that Romney regained control of the narrative, delivering a performance that was clever, funny, energetic, and passionate. His debates performance was historic, transforming the election in a way that few have ever done.\n\nUltimately, the contradictions inherent within both Romney and his party could not be overcome. The need to be both conservative and moderate confused and frustrated the electorate, who were never quite sure what they were voting for. The advantage fell to the incumbent, and the ambivalent American public went with the devil they knew.\n\nAs for Mitt Romney's future, it remains to be seen. It is possible that he will return to his church, a man of faith with a record of charity. It is hoped that the conservative movement and the pundits will be just as charitable to him.",
    " Title: Constitutional Amendments Referendum in Turkey: Experts Predict Shift Towards Inclusive Politics and Political Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the April 16 referendum on proposed constitutional amendments fast approaching, both the President and Prime Minister are intensifying their efforts to persuade voters to support the changes. The proposed amendments, if passed, are expected to bring about significant changes to Turkey's political landscape, with a focus on promoting inclusivity and political unity.\n\nOne of the key arguments in favor of the proposed changes is the potential for a more inclusive political system. The new system would require the presidential candidate to secure more than 50 percent of the votes, making it challenging for political parties to form governments with weak support. This, according to experts, will change the political culture that has long been prevalent in Turkey, where parties have been able to form governments with as little as 20 to 30 percent of the vote through short-lived coalition governments.\n\n\u0130smail \u00c7a\u011flar, the director of public and media researches at the Ankara-based think tank, the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA), and an academic at Istanbul Medeniyet University, explained, \"Due to the technical change emerging with the new system, where the president is forced to receive 50+1 percent of the votes, the parties are no longer able to form governments with weak support. In a way, this will change the political culture which Turkey has long been accustomed to.\"\n\n\u00c7a\u011flar further stated that parties would now have to form types of coalitions with other parties during the elections at the ballot boxes to become more inclusive and more appealing to a larger voter base. He added that parties, without reaching out to voters beyond their traditional electoral base, including the Kurds or the conservative voters, would not be able to achieve a desired result.\n\nThe supporters of the proposed changes argue that Turkey has long suffered from short-lived governments, with some having an average lifespan of about a year-and-a-half. The changes will abolish the prime minister's post, which the AK Party claims resulted in an ineffective dual-headed political system, and replace it with a stronger system, expected to produce stability and a more effective system of governance in the long term.\n\nPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m stated on Wednesday that the proposed changes were not only for the AK Party but were also in favor of all parties that aim to work and serve the people. \"I am sure the way toward forming a government is going to be paved for anyone who wants to work and struggle, aiming to win people's hearts. The path is open for anyone who embraces Turkey, however, the road toward a government would be closed off to divisive, regional, ethnicity-based parties, or a specific religious group,\" Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said in \u0130zmir, underlining that with the new system of government, the channels to divisive politics were being shut down, and a way toward unity was opened.\n\nYa\u015far Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu, Yeni Y\u00fczy\u0131l University's rector and an academic in the Department of International Relations, stated that with the changes in the new system, the political atmosphere will have to change to one that is more embracing, leading to the elimination of political polarization. \"The political rhetoric will have to soften up, and the parties or the presidential candidate will need to get the approval of voters from various parts of society. This will make them more conciliatory and accommodating to the needs of the diverse social fabric of the country,\" Hacisaliho\u011flu said, adding that it will also diminish the political tension among different poles.\n\nAccording to a survey by pollsters ANAR, the \"yes\" votes are currently at 52 percent, with the number of undecided voters falling to 8 percent. Similarly, polling company Konsensus puts \"yes\" votes at 51.2 percent after the distribution of undecided voters. President Erdo\u011fan, speaking in eastern Turkey's eastern Erzurum province on Wednesday, said, \"Now the state becomes the people's state, without any intermediary in between. April 16 is going to be a nightmare for those burning with desire to form a government but serve only themselves instead of the people. Their nightmare will become my people's reason to celebrate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also underscored that the new system would force parties to be more inclusive and would reflect all colors of the country as it would need more than 50 percent of all votes to be able to form a government. The referendum on April 16 promises to bring significant changes to Turkey's political landscape, with experts predicting a shift towards more inclusive politics and political unity.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Budget Director Pushes for Sanctuary Cities Restriction in Government Funding Bill, Threatening Bipartisan Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, is urging congressional Republicans to include a restriction on federal funding for sanctuary cities in the must-pass spending bill, complicating efforts to avoid a government shutdown at the end of April. This move, according to officials from both parties, threatens to disrupt bipartisan negotiations on funding the government.\n\nMulvaney is pressing lawmakers to include language in the bill that would restrict federal funding grants for cities that do not enforce federal immigration policies. The goal is to gain the support of the House Freedom Caucus for the government funding bill or to demonstrate that the administration is courting the hard-right and pushing GOP leaders to adopt Trump's priorities.\n\nHowever, this effort by Mulvaney, a former conservative congressman from South Carolina, risks derailing bipartisan negotiations on funding the government. Democrats have already labeled a request for border wall money as a \"poison pill\" that could lead to a government shutdown. Similarly, an attempt to block liberal cities from receiving federal funds if they ignore immigration guidance would likely cause Democrats to withdraw from negotiations. The budget bill will need Democratic votes to pass, at least eight in the Senate, but probably in the House as well.\n\n\"It would blow up any chance of a bipartisan deal. Getting wall money is hard enough, and you get a guy pushing new riders out of nowhere,\" said a Republican congressional aide. \"I don't see how catering to the Freedom Caucus votes help on the spending bill.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the matter, referring questions to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nNegotiations between congressional leaders are already delicate. Trump wants $1.4 billion for a border wall and security in the spending bill, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says his caucus won't support it. The Democratic leader reiterated his caucus's stance during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"There are no negotiations \u2014 I met with Mulvaney once,\" Schumer said. \"We hope our Republican colleagues won't insist on things that will cause a government shutdown, but talks are going pretty well right now.\"\n\nIndeed, Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have been making significant progress that could be derailed by Mulvaney's move. McConnell said in an interview on Friday that he had a \"cordial\" meeting with Schumer last week about avoiding a shutdown. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have vowed there will be no shutdown.\n\nSenior Republicans and members of the Appropriations Committee are trying to keep Mulvaney's proposal out of the bill. The fear is that Senate Democrats will filibuster any bill with the sanctuary cities language and put Washington on a path toward a shutdown.\n\nIn the House, a GOP leadership source said the sanctuary cities restriction would repel Democrats and force Speaker Ryan to rely on House Freedom Caucus members to pass a funding bill.\n\n\"Of course, that's a nonstarter,\" Matt Dennis, a spokesman for House Appropriations Committee ranking member Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), said of the sanctuary cities idea.\n\nCongress returns in two weeks and will have just five days to avert a shutdown before funding expires on April 28. Because of the nation's decentralized process for grant-giving, it's difficult to say how much money would be at stake if Mulvaney's sanctuary cities proposal were adopted. While many grants come directly from a federal agency, more are doled out through state governments or local organizations.\n\nAfter Trump administration officials suggested they would seek to block funding for sanctuary cities in January, Reuters projected that the 10 largest cities, from New York to Washington D.C., would stand to lose $2.27 billion in federal grants. That includes money for Head Start preschool programs, HIV prevention, and airport infrastructure.\n\nCutting off money to sanctuary cities would force lawmakers to make tough decisions about whether to cut off an entire county from funding because a grant recipient technically falls within a sanctuary jurisdiction, the Congressional Research Service warned in a March report.\n\nRepublicans have little appetite for another high-profile failure, after the collapse last month of their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. A government shutdown would undoubtedly be seen as a debacle for the Trump White House and the Republican Party, though Democrats could also draw blame if they vote against government funding.\n\nA Senate Democratic aide said that either border-wall funding or the sanctuary cities crackdown would tank any bipartisan efforts at a funding bill.\n\nMulvaney said in an interview Sunday with a Charlotte, North Carolina, radio host that it's important that the president's priorities be reflected in a government funding bill. A border wall was a centerpiece of Trump's campaign, and he was vocal about putting the screws to sanctuary cities, too.\n\n\"Elections have consequences. The president needs to see his priorities funded,\" Mulvaney told WBT, \"if he's going to be participating in signing these bills.\"",
    " Title: Exonerated Ricin Suspect Speaks Out: \"I'm Extremely Happy to be Vindicated\"\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live,\" Paul Kevin Curtis, the Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, who was arrested last week for allegedly sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator, and a judge, expressed his relief and gratitude for being released from custody.\n\n\"It's like a train has been lifted off my shoulders,\" Curtis said. \"I'm overwhelmed. I'm extremely happy to be vindicated and out and able to see my kids.\"\n\nThe charges against Curtis were dropped, and U.S. Attorney Felicia Adams announced that new information had become available. Authorities are now investigating whether someone may have tried to falsely implicate Curtis. A law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed this development.\n\nCurtis was initially arrested on April 17 and charged with sending a threat to the president after letters containing the poison triggered security scares around Washington. The letters, each with a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, read, \"To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" They were signed \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"\n\nCurtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, stated that her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis often uses on social media. McCoy expressed her belief that someone else was responsible for the letters, stating, \"I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him.\"\n\nCurtis added, \"It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this.\" He also expressed concern about the potential misuse of circumstantial evidence in similar cases.\n\nThe FBI confirmed that the substance in the letters tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans with no known antidote. No illnesses had been reported as a result of exposure to the toxin. The investigation into the matter continues.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions and Statements Raise Concerns Over Constitutional Rights and Press Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the conservative values they claim to uphold, President Donald Trump's actions and statements have raised concerns over constitutional rights and press freedom. The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of \u2588\u2588\u2588.com.\n\nLast year, many conservatives, who struggled to justify a vote for Donald Trump, found solace in the potential appointment of justices by President Hillary Clinton, whom they believed would not faithfully interpret the Constitution. However, the president, who has been in office for over three years, has shown a disregard for the nation's founding document, which is a far cry from the strict constructionist ideals of conservatism.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's comments regarding NBC News' report of a proposed increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal were particularly noteworthy. The president expressed frustration with the press, stating that it was \"frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write\" and threatened to revoke the network's broadcast license. It is important to note that licenses are granted to stations, not networks.\n\nTrump's disdain for the First Amendment, which upholds the freedom of the press, is evident in his statements. This is the same president who, in the past, has invited violence against reporters by tweeting a doctored video that appeared to show him punching a CNN representative.\n\nThe president's threat to punish allegedly inaccurate reporting by silencing a news organization is a betrayal of gargantuan ignorance and childish petulance. Press freedom extends to broadcast news media, which are entitled to report and comment without government interference.\n\nTrump's empty threat flowed naturally from his past pronouncements on such matters. During the campaign, he vowed to change libel laws to make it easier for public figures to win libel suits. His position is at war with one of the Supreme Court's most important and unassailable decisions, reached in 1964, which requires that citizens be able to express their views without fear of being punished for inadvertent misstatements.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's three orders on foreigners traveling to the United States, which were ruled unconstitutional, were a direct result of his campaign vow to ban all Muslims. His position on this issue has been met with resistance, with the latest order being challenged in court.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has also been criticized for his stance on constitutional rights. He has spurned the January Justice Department report that found Chicago police guilty of \"pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force,\" including killing people without a good reason. The Obama administration wanted to prevent these abuses through a consent decree, but Sessions has shown no interest in addressing or even acknowledging such issues.\n\nIn a memo rejecting corrective action, Sessions stated, \"It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies.\" However, when they violate the federal Constitution, it is.\n\nTrump's supporters feared that a Clinton presidency would damage constitutional rights over time through a liberal Supreme Court. Instead, they have a president who prefers to damage them immediately all by himself.",
    " Title: Former Governors Discuss Syria Conflict and Israel's Airstrike on Iranian Missiles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson stated that Israel's reported airstrike outside of Damascus on Sunday is a clear signal to Iran, Hezbollah, and potentially the United States that the situation in the Syrian region is becoming increasingly tense.\n\nRichardson, a Democrat, was responding to developing reports that Israel had intercepted a missile shipment from Iran to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group, with the strike, and to reports that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad are using chemical weapons against their own people.\n\nWhen asked about the potential U.S. response, Richardson suggested that President Obama may opt for a limited military option in the coming days.\n\nFormer South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint, who vacated his seat at the start of the year to take over the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, criticized the Obama administration for being too passive in addressing the conflict in Syria. DeMint stated that the president's indecisiveness has likely contributed to Israel's involvement in the conflict.\n\nDeMint's reference to a \"red line\" has become a contentious issue for the White House. In August, President Obama suggested that the use of chemical weapons would cross a threshold, or \"red line,\" that could change his stance on American intervention in Syria's civil war. Since then, critics have accused the Obama administration of staking out an unclear position on potential U.S. military involvement in the conflict.\n\nRichardson suggested that increasing signs that the British and French governments could arm the Syrian rebels could pave the way for some form of American intervention. However, DeMint argued that Syria is a distraction and that the focus should be on how the U.S. can demonstrate support for Israel and continue the pressure on Iran, the potential distributor of weapons to Israel's enemies.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney: CEO, Not Politician - A Closer Look at Romney's Core Values\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the highly partisan political landscape, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has often been criticized for his perceived lack of a \"core\" or a solid set of political beliefs. However, a closer examination of Romney's career and political evolution suggests that he may not be the ideologically-shifting politician some perceive him to be, but rather a CEO with a distinct core that prioritizes success and adaptability.\n\nRomney's success in the business world has been well-documented. He has repeatedly emphasized his background in the private sector, stating, \"I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. I only spent four years as a governor. I did not inhale. I'm a business guy.\"\n\nUnlike politicians who adhere rigidly to their ideological positions, a CEO is not shackled by ideology. Instead, a CEO's success is measured by the bottom line, not by how many principles they stick to. If a product is not selling, a CEO does not persist in promoting it until it destroys the business. Instead, they tweak it, rebrand it, and try new strategies to appeal to their target audience.\n\nRomney's political career mirrors this CEO approach. His changing views on key issues are not sudden or unexpected, but rather, they are calculated to appeal to the customers he is targeting at that moment. This strategy is evident in Romney's shifting stance on issues like Obamacare, abortion, and gun control, where he has modified his positions to align with the views of the electorate he is trying to reach.\n\nFor example, this week, Romney declared that the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare is a tax. However, when Romney was the governor of Massachusetts, he implemented an identical individual mandate but consistently denied it was a tax. Romney has simply modified his \"product line\" to attract the most customers based on the current marketplace conditions.\n\nThis approach is also apparent in Romney's evolving stance on abortion and gun control. In his run for the Senate in 1994 and for governor in 2002, Romney was unequivocally pro-choice and supported gun control measures. However, when seeking the Republican nomination, he tweaked his stance to appeal to more conservative voters by stating his opposition to abortion and support for the Second Amendment.\n\nRomney's ability to adapt to different market conditions and target audiences has earned him both praise and criticism. For some, a CEO-style president could be a good fit, as Romney is likely to be a pragmatic leader, not rigidly beholden to ideology. However, for others, Romney's ever-evolving product line and adaptability lead to doubt about every word he says.\n\nIn conclusion, Mitt Romney's career in business and politics suggests that he is a CEO, not a politician. He is a man with a distinct core, but not one of a politician, but one of a CEO. His success is measured by how well he can sell his product, not by how many principles he sticks to. Whether this approach makes him a good fit for the presidency is a matter of personal opinion, but it is clear that Romney is a man who is willing to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of his customers.",
    " Title: Small Businesses in Ferguson, Missouri, Suffer Financial Losses Amid Ongoing Protests and Civil Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nFerguson, Missouri \u2013 The small businesses that line the streets of this city have been hit hard in the past ten days due to the ongoing riots, vandalism, and looting. Business owners shared their struggles with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday.\n\nLooters and vandals have caused significant damage, smashing storefront windows, spray-painting graffiti, stealing property, and even burning down businesses. Some stores have reopened with plywood covering their smashed windows, with signs reading \"Open for Business.\" However, many customers are too afraid to visit.\n\nSonny Dayan, a small business owner who runs a cell phone store in a small strip mall on West Florrissant Avenue, shared his experience. \"The first time [my store was hit] it was Saturday, early morning. I had shoplifters. You just don't know what to expect. Is there going to be another one? Is there going to be another break-in?\" he said.\n\nThe owner of a medical facility also shared her concerns, stating, \"Our patients are canceling left and right because they don't want to come on our street.\" She requested anonymity for fear of retribution from protesters. The shop owners are also concerned that the damages may not be covered by their insurance.\n\nDayan expressed his worry, saying, \"I have the best insurance, but I heard rumors they may try to play the social unrest card and say that I'm not covered, and say that this is a civil unrest and therefore I'm not covered.\" The medical facility owner echoed his sentiments, stating, \"Several of these businesses, and we checked ours - there's a cause in it that says there's no coverage for anything pertaining to a riot act. So any of the damage is coming out of the [business owner].\"\n\nShe added, \"So it's not enough that we've suffered for nine days and lost about 70 percent of the business and can't pay our rent and can't get anybody here to help us. So what else can we observe here as small business owners?\"\n\nThe ongoing unrest in Ferguson has had a significant impact on the local economy, with small businesses struggling to stay afloat amidst the chaos.",
    " Title: White House Denies Intention of Firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released Sunday night, White House attorney Ty Cobb confirmed that President Donald Trump is not considering or discussing the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The statement was issued in response to media speculation and related questions regarding the President's intentions.\n\nThe denial comes after a series of tweets from President Trump about Mueller and the President's personal lawyer calling for an end to the probe. In his tweets, Trump questioned the legitimacy of the Mueller investigation, stating that it was based on a \"fraudulent\" dossier and improperly used in FISA court for surveillance of his campaign.\n\nTrump's messages came hours after his personal attorney, John Dowd, issued a statement reacting to the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. In that statement, Dowd called for an end to the alleged Russia collusion investigation, stating that it was manufactured by McCabe's boss, former FBI Director James Comey, based on a \"fraudulent and corrupt dossier.\"\n\nHowever, Dowd later clarified that he was not speaking on behalf of the White House. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also criticized Dowd's statement, stating, \"If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\"\n\nA number of lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle have also warned Trump not to call for Mueller's firing, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that if Trump \"tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"",
    " Title: New York City's Coronavirus Contact Tracers Not Inquiring About Protest Attendance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at maintaining privacy and avoiding potential stigmatization, New York City's coronavirus contact-tracing force is not actively inquiring whether individuals who test positive for COVID-19 have attended Black Lives Matter demonstrations, a city spokesperson confirmed.\n\nAvery Cohen, a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio, told THE CITY that the directive prohibits proactive questioning about protest attendance. However, individuals are given the opportunity to volunteer such information if they wish.\n\nMayor de Blasio, who announced his plan last month to hire 1,000 \"contact tracers,\" is set to reveal on Monday how many city residents have been questioned so far.\n\nThe contact tracers are tasked with asking those who test positive for Covid-19 to \"recall 'contacts' and individuals they may have exposed,\" Cohen explained. Tracers also investigate any \"close contacts\" of the patient\u2014anyone who has been within six feet of the infected person for at least 10 minutes.\n\nNew York City officials have adopted a cautious stance regarding the potential impact of mass protests on coronavirus cases. \"Let's be clear about something: if there is a spike in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks, don't blame the protesters. Blame racism,\" Mark Levine, head of the city council's health committee, tweeted earlier this month.\n\nMayor de Blasio, whose daughter was arrested during a Manhattan protest over the death of George Floyd, is currently facing a lawsuit from Catholics and Jews for allegedly violating the constitutional rights of religious New Yorkers by imposing restrictions on religious services. However, De Blasio has countered accusations of hypocrisy, arguing that the situation is not comparable.\n\n\"When you see...an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of American racism, I'm sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,\" de Blasio said in a press conference earlier this month.",
    " Title: Abortion Debate Temporarily Stalls Coronavirus Relief Bill as Lawmakers Negotiate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs lawmakers move closer to finalizing a coronavirus relief package that includes provisions for paid sick leave and free virus testing, a few obstacles have emerged. Among these hurdles is the attempt by some Republicans to insert anti-choice restrictions into the House's relief bill, momentarily transforming a public health crisis into an abortion debate.\n\nThe disputes reportedly revolve around the Hyde Amendment, a long-standing provision that prohibits federal funds from being used for abortion services, denying millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid access to abortion care.\n\nAccording to conservative media, some top Republicans believe a clause in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories conducting coronavirus testing could potentially override the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions. In response, anti-choice lawmakers have demanded the inclusion of language in the legislation that reaffirms the principles of the amendment.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday that negotiations over the coronavirus response bill would continue into next week, accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of turning the legislation into an \"ideological wish list.\"\n\n\"Instead of focusing on immediate relief for affected individuals, families, and businesses, the House Democrats chose to wander into various areas of policy that are barely related, if at all, to the issue before us,\" McConnell said.\n\nIt is not uncommon for Republicans to use unrelated legislation as a vehicle for their anti-abortion agenda. In the past, they have used legislation tied to public health emergencies to advance their anti-abortion policies. For instance, during the spread of the Zika virus in 2016, anti-choice lawmakers added a provision blocking Planned Parenthood health care providers from accessing any of the designated emergency funds.\n\nConservative lawmakers also attempted to sneak an anti-abortion provision into President Trump's 2017 tax plan, offering expectant parents the option of creating a college savings account before their child is even born. The measure included fetal personhood language, referring to fetuses as \"unborn children,\" and defining \"unborn child\" as any \"child in utero.\"\n\nAbortion restrictions have been a contentious issue in spending bills, with both parties using these bills to push for policies they are struggling to advance by other means. In 2018, the White House pressured Republicans in Congress to insert measures threatening to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood into a bill aimed at preventing the third government shutdown of the year\u2014even though government dollars never went to funding abortion services at the clinics due to the Hyde Amendment. Less than a year later, Democrats used their new House majority to pass a spending bill that challenged one of the Trump administration's most wide-reaching abortion restrictions: the global gag rule, a law that bars U.S. funding from going to international organizations that provide abortion services or even discuss abortion as a form of reproductive health care. (This version of the spending bill did not pass Senate Republicans.)\n\nWhile government shutdowns can become national emergencies, none have compared to the scale of the current global coronavirus pandemic, which could leave the U.S. in a worse state than countries like Italy\u2014which put a quarter of its population on emergency quarantine\u2014if decisive action is not taken sooner.\n\nThe unemployment benefits and free testing at the core of the coronavirus relief package are crucial in preventing further spread of the virus and ensuring that low-wage workers can afford necessities like food, rent, and other expenses if they fall ill or if their workplaces close to minimize harm, or as a result of government mandates.\n\nNeither of these issues is related to abortion\u2014they are urgent health matters that require the quickest possible response from elected officials.",
    " Title: Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Nominee, E.W. Jackson, Accuses 'Civil Rights Establishment' of Selling Out Christian Values\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a four-minute video posted on YouTube last fall, E.W. Jackson, the newly minted Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Virginia, accused the \"civil rights establishment\" of selling out their Christian values in order to support Democratic policy positions on gay marriage and abortion. The video, which has resurfaced amidst the 2013 elections, is likely to stir the culture-war politics of the state.\n\nIn the video message, Jackson, a black minister and activist nominated for lieutenant governor on Saturday, criticized the Democratic Party for creating an \"unholy alliance\" between certain civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides reproductive health services, including abortion. Jackson compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan, stating that the abortion rights-supporting group has been \"more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was.\"\n\nThe website of an advocacy group founded by Jackson, Staying True to America's National Destiny (STAND), describes abortion as \"the equivalent of an idolatrous offering to the god of'sexual license.'\" The website further compares abortion to pagan practices of the past, stating that it is \"no different than in times past when pagans offered their babies on an altar of fire to assure their own good fortune.\"\n\nThe emergence of Jackson as a standard-bearer for the Republican Party could have implications beyond the race for lieutenant governor. Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli has sought to keep his campaign message focused on jobs and economic concerns, while Democrats have assailed him for his staunchly conservative record on abortion and gay rights. The selection of Jackson for the GOP ticket may help keep social issues in the foreground of the 2013 debate.\n\nThe comments about Planned Parenthood in particular are incendiary. The abortion rights-supporting group ran web ads against Cuccinelli only this last week, and the Democratic Party of Virginia produced a wave of robo-calls accusing the state attorney general of \"pursuing an ideological tea party agenda that bans abortion.\"\n\nA Jackson adviser did not respond to emails seeking comment. Republican Party of Virginia spokesman Garren Shipley defended the candidate as a person of faith and predicted the 2013 elections would not hinge on social issues.\n\n\"It is no secret that E.W. Jackson has deeply held Christian conservative beliefs,\" Shipley said in an email. \"But the race for lieutenant governor will be fought on economic ground as opposed to social policy. In the weeks and months ahead, Jackson will focus on ideas that produce more quality jobs for Virginians and make life easier for families and workers.\"",

Speaking to NBC News' Kate Snow, Swetnick also called Kavanaugh a \"liar\" for dismissing her allegations against him.\n\nSwetnick, in her sworn statement released last week, alleged that Kavanaugh preyed on young women. In Monday's interview, she did not accuse Kavanaugh of assaulting her. However, she described Kavanaugh as \"belligerent and aggressive\" in his drinking habits, a claim corroborated by a Yale classmate.\n\nDuring the interview, Swetnick strayed at times from her sworn statement, admitting she did not know if Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, would \"spike\" the punch at house parties to cause girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say \"no.\"\n\nSwetnick alleged that Kavanaugh was among a group of boys who would doctor the punch to \"cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys.\" However, during the interview, she clarified that the boys were not \"lined up\" but \"huddled by the doors.\"\n\nSwetnick could not specifically name Kavanaugh as one of her attackers at the party where she said she was sexually assaulted. She told Snow, \"I can not specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me.\"\n\nSwetnick said she had told her mother and reported the incident to Montgomery County police. However, her mother and the police officer who took the report are both deceased, and the department told NBC News it could take weeks to retrieve records about the incident.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has remained supportive of his Supreme Court pick, telling reporters on Monday that he believed the ongoing FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's background would be \"a good thing.\" Also on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the full Senate would vote on Kavanaugh's nomination this week.",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Reform Bill Advances, Facing Contentious Amendments and Hurdles Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate took a significant step forward in the immigration reform debate on Tuesday, officially bringing the comprehensive bill to the chamber floor after successfully overcoming a filibuster. This marks the first time since 2007 that the contentious immigration issue has been back in front of Congress, with lawmakers anticipating numerous hurdles in the legislative process.\n\nIn the first two hours of debate, senators filed 44 amendments to the 1,075-page bill, covering a range of issues from social matters to more technical proposals. Among the proposed changes are amendments that could potentially serve as \"poison pills\" by granting immigration benefits to same-sex partners of American citizens and requiring illegal immigrants to wait until the borders are deemed secure before they can obtain legal status.\n\nOther contentious amendments include proposals on the level for guest-workers, the use of English as the official language of the U.S., and the tracking of entries and exits at airports and seaports. With the bill now officially before the Senate, the question is which of these amendments will be allowed to come up for a vote.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has warned that he will allow some latitude but will have little patience for those he believes are trying to undercut the bill rather than sincerely working to improve it. He has stated that he will be vigilant in protecting the crux of the immigration deal, which was worked out by the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" senators.\n\nThe deal, as it stands, is not expected to pass the chamber, according to Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was part of the Gang of Eight and is considered key to selling the bill to conservatives. Rubio has stated that the legislation needs stiffer border security, better checks of visitors entering and leaving the country, and more stringent English-language requirements.\n\nOne of the bill's shortcomings, according to Rubio, is the provision that allows illegal immigrants who eventually apply for permanent residency to demonstrate that they understand English or have enrolled in classes to learn the language. Rubio has indicated that he will offer an amendment striking that option, requiring anyone seeking full legal residency to prove that they understand English.\n\nOther amendments introduced by senators include those allowing businesses to implement English-only policies in their workplaces and designating English as the official language of the U.S. These amendments have proven contentious in the past, as they poll exceptionally well with voters but have sparked debate when Congress has debated immigration reform in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe 82-15 vote on Tuesday to head off a filibuster marked an auspicious start for this year's debate. In a similar vote in 2007, supporters only managed to garner 69 votes. The difference this year is that far more Republicans are eager to at least hold the debate, with many feeling that their political futures depend on reaching out to Hispanic voters who view the immigration issue as a litmus test.\n\nNow, the focus will be on about 20 Republicans who voted to begin the debate but are likely to want to see major changes before they support the final product. One of those is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has stated that the legislation has \"serious flaws.\" He seems to accept the legalization of illegal immigrants, but his concerns lie chiefly with how the bill handles border security and with the taxpayer benefits that newly legalized illegal immigrants may be eligible for, such as tax credits.\n\nOther contentious amendments include those related to the gay-rights issue, such as an amendment from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, that would grant immigration benefits to partners in states that perform same-sex unions. Some Catholic and Evangelical leaders that are supporting the immigration bill have warned they could withdraw their support over the gay-rights issue. Offering it on the floor is less dangerous because it likely will take 60 votes to add it to the bill\u2014a threshold Leahy is unlikely to achieve. Seeking a vote now would give him a chance to take a stand without fear of derailing the full bill.\n\nAs the Senate continues to debate the immigration reform bill, it remains to be seen which amendments will be allowed to come up for a vote and how the final product will shape up. The pressure is on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to navigate the contentious amendments and ensure the bill's passage.",
    " Title: Democrats' Memo on FBI and DOJ's Use of Trump-Russia Dossier Omitted Key Facts, According to GOP Rebuttal\n\nThe Democrats' memo, released on Saturday, provides a counterpoint to the one released by the Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in February. The Democratic memo aims to refute the Republicans' allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) system in obtaining a warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in 2016.\n\nHowever, the Democratic memo has been criticized for omitting several key points. One of the most significant omissions is the contention by former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe, who testified in December that the FISA warrant would not have been sought without the infamous Trump-Russia dossier, which was commissioned by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). This point was a key argument in the Republican memo.\n\nDemocratic California Rep. Eric Swalwell had earlier this month claimed that Republicans had mischaracterized McCabe's testimony. However, the Democrats declined to directly refute that claim in their own memo.\n\nIn their rebuttal to the Democratic memo, Republicans noted several other omissions. They claim that the Democratic memo ignores the fact that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the Trump-Russia dossier, a significant portion of the Carter Page FISA application, as confirmed by the Graham-Grassley referral. The Democratic memo, according to the GOP rebuttal, does not contain a single reference to the DNC or Clinton campaign, or acknowledge that they funded the dossier, or admit that this information was not provided to the FISA Court.\n\nThe Republican rebuttal also points out that the Democratic memo confirms a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was part of the FISA application. However, the memo ignores the fact that the FBI failed to subsequently inform the Court that the dossier's author, Steele, provided information to Yahoo News. Isikoff has publicly confirmed Steele was a source for his article about Page.\n\nLastly, Republicans claim the Democratic memo paints an incomplete picture of Page's past activities, and omits that, in a secretly-taped statement reproduced in a 2015 federal court filing, a Russian intelligence officer called Page \"an idiot.\"\n\nThe ongoing debate between the two memos highlights the differing interpretations of the events surrounding the use of the Trump-Russia dossier in the FISA warrant application for Carter Page.",
    " Title: Gas Prices Plummet Below $1.42 in Certain U.S. Areas: A Look at the Factors Influencing the Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nGasoline prices in various parts of the United States have dipped below $1.42 per gallon, with AAA and GasBuddy predicting that sub-$2 gas prices will become commonplace in most of the country. This development is largely attributed to falling oil prices, robust refinery capacity, and lower state taxes.\n\nThe decline in oil prices, which has dropped below $33 per barrel, is a significant factor. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to maintain high oil exports has effectively dismantled the OPEC cartel, leading to an oil supply glut. Slowing national economies, particularly in China, the world's largest oil importer, are also contributing to lower demand.\n\nThe cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the U.S., can exceed the selling price in some cases. However, the industry continues to pump oil, increasing supply, while some companies struggle to survive due to low crude prices.\n\nThe location of refineries plays a crucial role in gasoline prices, especially for those states with large refineries or those near them. Refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, including those south of Houston owned by Exxon Mobil Corp., process hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries, when they are running at or near capacity and producing gasoline instead of other petroleum products, can significantly lower gas prices.\n\nState taxes and levies also impact gas prices. Several states with low gas prices house large refineries or are close to those that do. For instance, South Carolina, Missouri, and Oklahoma have gas taxes that average at or below $1.75 per gallon. These taxes are significantly lower in these states, with South Carolina's tax at $0.3515, Missouri's at $0.3570, and Oklahoma's at $0.3540.\n\nAs oil prices continue to fall and state taxes remain low, the likelihood of gas prices reaching $1 per gallon in some areas of the U.S. increases, particularly in areas where prices are already close to $1.40. This trend is likely to continue, offering relief to American consumers at the pump.",
    " Title: President Obama Welcomes 25 Active-Duty Service Members as New Citizens, Advocates for Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama began his Fourth of July celebration on Wednesday by naturalizing 25 active-duty service members in the East Room of the White House. The event served as a platform for the President to highlight his recent executive order sparing hundreds of thousands from deportation and to urge lawmakers to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.\n\nFollowing the naturalization ceremony, conducted by Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano, Mr. Obama congratulated the new citizens and their families. \"What a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday - the world's oldest democracy - with some of our newest citizens,\" he said.\n\nThe President expressed his personal joy and inspiration, stating, \"I have to tell you, this is one of my favorite things to do. It reminds us that we are a country that is bound together not simply by our ethnicity or bloodlines, but by fidelity to a set of ideas.\"\n\nMr. Obama was particularly proud to welcome the group of service members as fellow citizens because they chose to serve the country \"that was not yet fully your own\" during a time of war. He emphasized America's status as a nation of immigrants and the crucial role each generation has played in building and shaping the country.\n\nThe President called on Congress to pass the Dream Act, which would grant citizenship to certain illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and maintain good moral standing. He also urged a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, stating, \"For just as we remain a nation of laws, we have to remain a nation of immigrants.\"\n\nIn mid-June, Mr. Obama bypassed Congress and issued a directive allowing potentially over 800,000 young people to remain in the United States without the risk of being deported. The politically charged decision comes as Mr. Obama faces a tough re-election fight against likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with Hispanic voters in swing states playing a critical role in determining the next occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Romney has stated he would veto the Dream Act and favors a path to citizenship only for illegal immigrant young adults who join the military. In response to Mr. Obama's announcement, Mr. Romney said the move could make it harder to find a long-term fix to the immigration issue. Since then, Mr. Romney has been vague about his position, but he recently told supporters in a private meeting that he would not modify his hard-line immigration stance and opposition to amnesty, according to a report earlier this week in Politico.\n\nThe Dream Act last came before Congress in 2010 when it was defeated on a bipartisan filibuster. Democrats have introduced their own legislation again this year, and have called for the GOP to work with them. Mr. Romney has enlisted the campaign trail help of Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and rising star in the GOP who is working on his own version of a Dream Act.\n\nThe President and the first family planned to spend the afternoon and evening with military families at a USO concert on the White House's South Lawn featuring country music star Brad Paisley and the Marine Corps Band. Mr. Obama will embark on a two-day \"Betting on America\" tour on Thursday, visiting several northern Ohio communities that were instrumental in his 2008 win in the state and then onto Pennsylvania, another state he previously won, for an event in Pittsburgh.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Romney, who has been campaigning nearly nonstop since the end of primaries in the spring, was planning to spend the entire week with his family at their lakeside home in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he has been seen aboard a personal watercraft with his wife, playing volleyball with his five sons, and taking his grandchildren out for ice cream. While he may be technically on vacation, Mr. Romney is still staying focused on November. Mr. Romney huddled with campaign advisers Wednesday, as well as the aide overseeing his vice-presidential search. He made his first official public appearance of the week marching in Wolfeboro's July Fourth parade, shaking hands and speaking from the bed of a pickup truck.",
    " Title: Fed's Potential September Wind-Down of Asset Purchases: Implications for the Economy and 2014 Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve's continued plans to wind down its asset purchase program could have significant implications for the U.S. economy and the political landscape, particularly for the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race.\n\nFriday's Labor Department report, which showed a stronger-than-expected gain of 195,000 jobs in June, has raised speculation that the Fed might start tapering its extraordinary economic stimulus efforts as early as September. This jobs report, according to Nigel Gault, co-chief economist at the Parthenon Group, could increase the pressure on the Fed to act sooner rather than later.\n\nThe stock market initially responded positively to the jobs news, but the yield on the 10-year Treasury note quickly spiked over 2.7 percent, the highest level since 2011, indicating investor concerns about the potential impact of the Fed's actions on long-term interest rates.\n\nThe Fed's role in the U.S. economy has become increasingly significant in recent years, as it has filled the void left by a polarized political process in Washington. Under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Fed has kept short-term interest rates at near-zero and expanded its balance sheet by purchasing massive amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage debt. This policy has boosted consumer spending in areas such as housing and automobiles, driving much of the economic recovery.\n\nHowever, the traditional drivers of long-term growth, such as business investment and higher wages, have been largely absent. Friday's jobs report showed wages rising by just 10 cents to $24.01, with hourly earnings up 2.2 percent over the year. The jobs being created are not the high-wage positions that typically drive a robust economy. The leisure, hospitality, and retail industries added 112,000 of the total jobs created in June, while professional and business services added just 53,000.\n\nIf the Fed moves too quickly to wind down its asset purchases and raise interest rates, economists warn that it could send interest rates soaring and potentially tip the economy back into recession. This could have significant political consequences, particularly for the 2014 midterms and the 2016 presidential race. The Fed's actions could impact the economic conditions that will shape the political landscape in the coming years.",
    " Title: The Impact of Wisconsin's Anti-Union Law on Public Employee Unions and Wages\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin witnessed a significant labor uprising as public employees and their unions protested against the proposed evisceration of collective bargaining protections by then-Governor Scott Walker. Four years later, the Washington Post returned to Wisconsin to find a starkly different landscape. The public employee union law, which limited contract negotiations, required unions to collect dues manually, and mandated annual recertification of affiliates, has been more successful than anticipated.\n\nUnion membership in Wisconsin has seen a significant decline. The Wisconsin affiliate of the National Education Association has lost a third of its members, the American Federation of Teachers has halved, and the state employees union has fallen by 70 percent. The ratio of public employees to total population is at its lowest level in at least two decades, and overall union membership in Wisconsin has fallen to 11.7 percent, down from 16 percent 10 years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe decrease in union membership has also led to a decrease in the number of public employees. Contrary to Governor Walker's claim that the passage of the anti-union law would save jobs, the Wisconsin Budget Project finds that the number of public employees has decreased. Median household income in Wisconsin is $51,467 a year, nearly $800 below the national average, and has fallen consistently since the passage of the anti-union law in 2011.\n\nThe erosion of public unions in Wisconsin may have far-reaching implications for take-home pay. The Census Bureau's American Community Survey shows that the state has seen meager earnings growth, despite a fairly tight labor market with a headline unemployment rate of 5.2 percent. This undercounts the problem, as it doesn't cover total compensation. For example, in the wake of the anti-union law, public employees lost the equivalent of 8-10 percent in take-home pay because of increased contributions to healthcare and pension benefits.\n\nMoreover, the meager earnings growth that has come to Wisconsin has mostly gone to the top 1 percent of earners. The Wisconsin Budget Project reports that the state hit a record share of income going to the very top in 2012, a year after passage of the anti-union law. This doesn't include the $2 billion in tax cuts Walker initiated in his first term, which went disproportionately to the highest wage earners.\n\nThe trends in Wisconsin mirror those in the country at large, where labor has similarly stumbled. Real hourly wages fell for almost everyone nationwide in 2014, according to the Economic Policy Institute, except for the low-wage sector, bolstered by minimum wage increases at the state and local level. Wisconsin has not joined that movement, with its minimum wage still consistent with the federal floor, at $7.25 an hour.\n\nWhile it may be argued that squashing unions in Wisconsin had no bearing on income stagnation in the state, it would ignore how the labor market works. If public employees can't bargain for wages and benefits, they stay depressed. And employers who compete for well-educated workers, like those who take jobs in teaching and government administration, similarly don't have to increase wages to attract their services. Blunting worker power in one sector has ripple effects everywhere else.\n\nThe erosion of collective bargaining is the single largest factor suppressing wage growth for middle-wage workers over the last few decades, according to economist Larry Mishel. Wisconsin provides a salient example of this. The labor movement in Wisconsin, crippled by the anti-union law, may have real consequences for middle-class wages. Since Governor Walker wants to bring this policy menu to the rest of the country in 2016, people on Main Streets outside of Wisconsin should take note.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach in Syria: A Question of Effectiveness and Respect\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump's unconventional diplomatic style has come under scrutiny following the ongoing crisis in Syria. Critics argue that his blunt, often confrontational language, which he defends as a modern, forceful approach, has proven ineffective and disrespectful, as evidenced by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's dismissive response to a strongly-worded missive from the White House.\n\nThe letter, intended as a warning, was reportedly met with laughter and disregard by Erdo\u011fan, who allegedly even discarded it, according to the BBC. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the diminished respect for American leadership on the global stage.\n\nDaniel Nexon, a political scientist, has labeled Trump a \"paper tiger,\" suggesting that his influence is perceived as weak. The best argument in favor of Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria is that Turkey was determined to invade regardless, and the president acted to protect U.S. soldiers from harm.\n\nHowever, this argument is questionable, as Trump had previously managed to deter Erdo\u011fan for two years. If this argument holds true, Trump's decision to delay action for over a week has been criticized as a waste of precious time. Erdo\u011fan pressed ahead with the invasion, disregarding Trump's warnings.\n\nWhen the threatened sanctions were imposed, they failed to deter Erdo\u011fan. American troops were targeted during the chaotic withdrawal, and American planes are now bombing U.S. munitions dumps to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Independent observers have reported atrocities in the fighting.\n\nCurrently, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are in Ankara, attempting traditional diplomacy. However, if Erdo\u011fan maintains his stance, it could highlight the lack of respect for American leadership abroad. If Pence and Pompeo succeed, it may demonstrate the failure of the president's personal approach.\n\nTrump's dismissive attitude towards the crisis, as shown by his comment that there's \"a lot of sand over there,\" has further fueled concerns about the world's perception of his leadership. It is challenging to believe that world leaders place significant trust in his words.\n\nThis incident in Syria raises questions about the effectiveness and appropriateness of Trump's unconventional diplomatic style, particularly in contrast to more traditional approaches. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Trump's approach will yield positive results or continue to erode the respect and influence of the United States on the global stage.",

The supporters around them laughed.\n\nHyde-Smith apologized for the comment during the debate when asked if she was willing to apologize. \"For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize,\" she said. \"There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements.\"\n\nHyde-Smith explained that she is very close to Hutchinson, whose parents died of cancer when he was in high school. She also clarified another phrase she used that day, stating that she told the browed she would fight a circle saw for Hutchinson. \"Obviously, I would not stick my arm in a circle saw,\" she said.\n\nHyde-Smith accused the Espy campaign of using her words for \"political gain.\" \"This comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said.\n\nEspy, in a rebuttal, said, \"No one twisted your comments, because the comments came out of your mouth.\" He also noted that the video went viral \"around the world\" in just three minutes. \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we know what came out of your mouth,\" he said.\n\nThe runoff election between Hyde-Smith and Espy is scheduled for Nov. 27th.",

The piece, titled \"It Might Be Time to Cut My Right-Wing, Trump-Loving In-Laws Out of My Kids' Lives,\" highlights the author's growing unease with the grandparents' \"offensive\" behaviors and the potential negative impact their political ideologies, including their pro-life views on abortion, may have on her children.\n\nSelinger's essay details several instances of her in-laws' intolerant and problematic comments, such as their lack of empathy towards marginalized groups, their support for controversial political figures, and their indifference towards issues like the treatment of migrant children at the U.S. border. The author also shares her frustration with her in-laws' refusal to engage in meaningful conversations about sensitive topics, such as the Charlottesville riots and the death of Heather Heyer.\n\nOne of Selinger's key complaints is her in-laws' intolerance, which she describes as only extending to people they know and understand, who are predominantly white, straight, and \"American.\" She recounts instances of her father-in-law's discomfort with same-sex relationships, his dismissive comments about impoverished black individuals, and his mother's lack of empathy towards the victims of the Charlottesville riots.\n\nSelinger's husband, who shares her values, is reportedly hesitant about cutting off his parents from their lives, while she is more resolute in her decision. The author expresses her concern that exposure to her in-laws' bigotry is harmful to her children and may negatively impact their development.\n\nThe article concludes with Selinger reflecting on the potential long-term consequences of her in-laws' influence on her children and her desire to protect them from \"evil.\" She acknowledges the difficulty of making a decision about the future of their relationship with her in-laws but is certain that they will prioritize their children's well-being.",
    " Title: The Trump Presidency: A Mixed Bag of Policies, Character Concerns, and the Future of the GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the year 2017 draws to a close, the Trump presidency has been a tumultuous journey, marked by a mix of policy victories, character concerns, and ongoing internal Republican Party struggles. The president's first year in office has seen a series of policy achievements, including tax reform, judicial appointments, and foreign policy decisions that have been largely in line with conservative ideals.\n\nHowever, the president's character and associates have been a source of ongoing concern for many, with his impulsive and often divisive behavior dominating headlines and sparking widespread criticism. The president's personal conduct, including his tweets and public statements, has overshadowed many of the concrete policy developments that have taken place during his tenure.\n\nIn the realm of foreign policy, the Trump administration has taken steps to reinforce NATO alliances, bolster military presence in key regions such as South Korea, Iraq, and Syria, and deliver lethal aid to Ukraine. The defeat of the Islamic State's caliphate in conventional combat is a significant achievement, albeit with elements of ISIS still active.\n\nDomestically, the administration has delivered on long-desired Republican goals, such as corporate tax cuts and the repeal of the individual mandate in Obamacare. The confirmation of conservative judges and the swift passage of judicial nominations have also been noteworthy developments.\n\nDespite these policy victories, the president's character and associates continue to be a source of concern for many, with some viewing the president's behavior as a threat to the Republican Party and the broader American political landscape. The ongoing internal struggles within the GOP, particularly the clash between the Bannon wing and more mainstream conservatives, have created a sense of unease and uncertainty.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the focus shifts to the role of character in politics and the potential impact it may have on the future of the Republican Party. The question of whether character is indeed destiny remains a topic of debate, with some arguing that the president's behavior has been detrimental to the GOP, while others maintain that policy achievements and conservative ideals are the key factors driving the party's success.\n\nRegardless of one's perspective, it is clear that the Trump presidency has been a transformative force within the Republican Party, reshaping the political landscape and sparking a debate about the role of character, policies, and the future of the GOP. As the nation moves into 2018, the focus will be on how these factors will play out in the midterm elections and beyond.",
    " Title: Barclays Scandal and Political Donations: A Look at Mitt Romney's Fundraising Ties Amidst Banking Investigations\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Barclays has agreed to pay a hefty sum of $450 million to settle allegations of rate manipulation. Following this, former CEO, Mr. Diamond, stepped down from his position. The scandal has taken a political turn, with 11 members of Parliament signing a resolution, urging Barclays executives to halt political fundraising and focus on rebuilding consumer trust in the banking sector.\n\nThe practice of soliciting donations from foreign sources is not new, with candidates allowed to accept contributions from citizens residing outside the United States. Barclays was the ninth-largest contributor to Mitt Romney's campaign, donating $234,650 through May, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. However, Democrats may be hesitant to draw attention to Mr. Romney's donations from large banks like Barclays, as employees have contributed $34,800 to President Obama's re-election bid.\n\nThis month, Vice President Biden attended a fundraiser in Park City, Utah, co-hosted by Mark Gilbert, a top executive at Barclays who has raised substantial funds for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign. Representatives from both the Romney and Obama campaigns declined to comment on the matter.\n\nBesides Barclays, executives from several banks under investigation, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse, are co-chairmen for Romney's London fundraisers. Mr. Romney, who was the head of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, plans to attend the opening ceremonies for the 2012 Games next Friday.\n\nThe ties to the firms under investigation could potentially overshadow a trip intended to highlight Mr. Romney's Olympic history. Moreover, it may provide ammunition to his left-wing critics, given Mr. Romney's stance against Wall Street regulation, such as the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nDespite the controversy, the co-host of one fundraiser, Karl Dasher, stated there was \"strong excitement\" for Romney among expatriates in London. Republican fundraisers described the London receptions as a case of awkward timing, noting that scrutiny of presidential donors always intensifies when a company is under investigation.\n\n\"You want to make sure that you don't wind up with egg on your face because you got some money from some guy who pulled a stunt. But you can't screen everybody that writes your check,\" said Alfred Hoffman Jr., a top Republican fundraiser not involved in the Romney campaign. \"You do the best you can\u2014you make sure that they're an American citizen.\"",

The strike has led to widespread mourning in Iran and heightened tensions between the two nations.\n\nAccording to reports, Soleimani's burial was postponed after as many as 40 people were killed and more than 200 injured during a crush in his hometown of Kerman. An emergency services official told Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency of the incident.\n\nSoleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, according to the State Department. He was strategically involved in operations that led to the deaths of U.S. personnel during the Iraq War, with 17 percent of all deaths of U.S. personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 attributed to Soleimani, as reported by Fox News.\n\nThe State Department stated that Soleimani was coordinating attacks on U.S. personnel, with \"highly credible\" and \"sound\" intelligence indicating these threats. The Department's statement reads, \"We can confirm that in the past several days, General Soleimani had been traveling in the Middle East coordinating further imminent large-scale attacks against U.S. diplomats and service members.\"\n\nThe Defense Department issued a statement on Soleimani's death, stating, \"General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\" The statement continued, \"General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.\"\n\nPresident Trump tweeted on Friday, \"General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught!\" He also stated, \"While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!\"\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei openly cried over Soleimani's death during the general's state-organized funeral on Monday. Khamenei, who worked closely with Soleimani for decades, uttered an emotional prayer during the funeral. The funeral procession was unlike any in Iran's recent history, showcasing the deep bond Khamenei had with the slain general and providing insight into how Soleimani's death is being felt personally by the supreme leader. It could also impact how Khamenei responds to the United States.\n\nThe aftermath of Soleimani's death remains uncertain, with tensions between the U.S. and Iran at an all-time high. The U.S. has vowed to protect its people and interests worldwide, and President Trump has stated that the strike aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.",

ABC also clarified that Flynn will say Trump asked him to make contact with Russia \"initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.\"\n\nOn Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty in federal court to making false statements to the FBI, a felony. The guilty plea is part of an agreement Flynn made with the special counsel's office, which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe Statement of Offense released by prosecutors details how Trump transition officials directed Flynn to reach out to Russian officials and officials from other countries during the presidential transition.\n\nIn a statement, Flynn said, \"my guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.\"\n\nAccording to ABC, Flynn made the decision to cooperate with Mueller only in the past 24 hours, as he faced mounting legal bills and intense pressure from prosecutors. \"He is distraught about the decision, but feels he is doing the right thing for his country,\" ABC reported.\n\nA previous version of this article incorrectly attributed to The Associated Press that Trump ordered Flynn to contact Russians.

    " Title: The Legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia and the Politicization of Judicial Confirmations\n\nArticle:\n\nEleven years after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's longest-tenured jurist in this session, the political impact of his death continues to overshadow the scope of his life and contributions to American jurisprudence. The breakdown of the legal and political process that turned Scalia into an afterthought in his own demise is a testament to the politicization of judicial confirmations that has plagued the American political landscape for decades.\n\nScalia began his judicial career under President Ronald Reagan, after serving in the Office of Legal Counsel under President Gerald Ford. Appointed initially for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Scalia's towering intellect made him an obvious choice for the Supreme Court. Four years later, when Chief Justice Warren Burger announced his retirement, Reagan had an opportunity to appoint either Scalia or Robert Bork, and he chose the younger Scalia.\n\nThe expectations of judicial confirmations in general, and Supreme Court nominations in particular, were much different 30 years ago. The general consensus held that elections had consequences, and presidents were entitled to significant deference on appointments\u2014even those with lifetime tenure, such as the federal bench. Senate rejection of Supreme Court nominees was not unknown, but even substantial opposition was rare.\n\nDespite a record of conservative decisions, Scalia benefited from that comity. Chosen in part for his youth and vigor, Scalia charmed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the upper chamber as a whole. He won confirmation on a 98-0 vote to become the first Italian-American to sit on the Supreme Court.\n\nThat turned out to be the last gasp of comity in judicial nominations. Less than a year later, Justice Lewis Powell retired, giving Reagan one more opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, and this time Reagan chose Bork. Democrats reacted angrily, in part because Bork had played a significant role in Watergate's \"Saturday Night Massacre.\" Of course, that was hardly the only reason that Democrats rallied to oppose Bork, who had made it clear that he found previous Supreme Court rulings on privacy to be unsubstantiated. His critics assumed that Bork would vote to overturn those precedents, especially the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion as a constitutional right. Pro-choice groups rallied opposition, and after a brutal confirmation hearing, Bork's nomination went down in defeat. Bork would later resign his seat on the DC Circuit in protest.\n\nThat touched off the politicization of judicial nominations that has overshadowed the death of Scalia. Democrats attempted to humiliate Clarence Thomas, but failed to defeat his nomination. Republicans delayed or blocked Bill Clinton's judicial appointments, and then Democrats responded with so many delays during the Bush years that it took the Gang of Fourteen deal in 2005 to retain the Senate filibuster and get some judicial appointments through the Senate.\n\nEven after that, Barack Obama himself voted to filibuster the confirmation of Samuel Alito in 2006. Going even further, Chuck Schumer pledged in mid-2007 that the Senate would approve no more Supreme Court nominations while George W. Bush was president\u2014a promise that did not get tested, as it turns out. When Barack Obama became president, Republicans fought his appointments until Harry Reid imposed the \"nuclear option\" that ended filibusters on judicial nominations, except for the Supreme Court.\n\nThat brings us to today, when one of the longest-serving members in the court's history has largely been forgotten in an unseemly scrum over who replaces him, and when. Republicans have adopted Schumer's 2007 position, while Democrats forget that the Senate has no obligation to approve nominees\u2014and that it was Democrats who were largely responsible for dispensing with deference to elected presidents in judicial appointments.\n\nA number of well-meaning thinkers have proposed stopgap solutions for this impasse. Jonathan Adler at The Washington Post suggested that a recess appointment of a retired Supreme Court justice could act as a stopgap until the next president takes office. Some argue that an open seat will actually work in favor of compromise; it would not affect cases that will get a substantial majority on the court, but any 4-4 ties that Scalia's vote would have settled will result in punts that have no precedential weight. Others want the Senate majority to work with the president to select a handful of mutually acceptable candidates, with the promise of expedited confirmation\u2014even though all of the political incentives will drive both sides away from compromise.\n\nNone of these solutions will work in a system where people lack the basic understanding of constitutional prerogatives on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and in which the Supreme Court has eclipsed both Congress and the president in creating policy. Scalia, ironically, spent nearly three decades attempting to move the court back to a less activist model. Had that effort succeeded, it would have made his own passing remarkable in itself rather than a bugle call for both sides to divvy up the spoils.\n\nEven with that, the epic breadth and depth of Scalia's impact on American jurisprudence may take several more decades to be fully appreciated. At the moment, though, the nearly 30-year tit-for-tat judiciary battle between Republicans and Democrats only deepens the belief among voters that America's institutions are failing its citizens, and that will be yet another reason for voters in both parties to look outside those institutions to make them work once more.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren's Campaign Receives Support from Dark Money Group in Florida Amidst Previous Anti-Dark Money Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senator Elizabeth Warren's struggling campaign has received a significant boost from a dark money group in Florida. New Florida Majority, a progressive social justice nonprofit that does not disclose its donors, disbursed $101,345 between February 27 and February 29 to support Warren's campaign. This move comes after Warren's campaign, which had just $2.3 million cash on hand in February, reversed course on receiving help from super PACs following the formation of Persist PAC on February 18 to support her candidacy.\n\nWarren, who has been a vocal critic of super PACs and dark money in political campaigns, had previously asked a dark money group to halt its promotion of her in November. However, it appears that she has now reversed course on dark money. In a statement, Chris Hayden, a spokesman for the campaign, said, \"Elizabeth Warren believes democracy is undermined by anonymous, dark-money attempts to influence voters\u2014whether that influence is meant to help or hurt her candidacy.\"\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the new dark money effort to support her candidacy in Florida, Warren's campaign did not respond.\n\nNew Florida Majority endorsed Warren late last year, citing her plans for \"big structural change.\" Andrea Mercado, executive director of New Florida Majority, said, \"The stakes are too high for millions of Floridians in 2020. We're prepared to support whoever the candidate is to defeat Trump and his agenda of inequality and division and our members endorse Elizabeth Warren as the best candidate for the job.\"\n\nIn its endorsement statement, New Florida Majority boasted that it helped reach 1.5 million voters and register 20,000 new voters in Florida as part of a coalition of liberal groups during the 2018 elections. The coalition, known as the Win Justice campaign, focused on the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, and Nevada.\n\nWin Justice's federal PAC was initially bankrolled by a $3 million check from liberal billionaire George Soros, who was for months the PAC's sole source of funding. Soros later contributed another $2 million to the committee. Cash also flowed in from billionaire megadonor Donald Sussman, director Steven Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw, and a host of liberal groups, including the Center for Community Change, Planned Parenthood, and the SEIU.\n\nNew Florida Majority has a goal of registering 100,000 new voters for the 2020 elections. Last week, the group held a joint press conference with the Florida Democratic Party and two other activist organizations, boasting that the groups have registered tens of thousands of Floridians as Democrats. The Florida primary is scheduled for March 17.",
    " Title: Sen. Tom Coburn's 2013 Wastebook Highlights Extravagant Federal Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a year marked by budgetary constraints due to sequestration, Sen. Tom Coburn's (R-Okla.) annual Wastebook has shed light on unnecessary federal government spending. The report, unveiled on Tuesday, documents instances of extravagant spending that contradict claims of a lack of funds for cuts.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) is under particular scrutiny in Coburn's report. Despite Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's warning last July 31 that sequestration could lead to an unprepared military due to a lack of training, maintenance, and equipment, Coburn found that the DoD is leaving 2,000 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in Afghanistan to be destroyed rather than delivered to other bases. These MRAPs, which cost $500,000 each to build, were rushed through the procurement process in 2007 in response to the increasing number of I.E.D attacks on NATO forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe report also highlights the purchase of 21 C-27 transport planes manufactured in Italy, authorized by Congress despite a former Air Force chief of staff's testimony in August 2012 that under sequestration cuts, the Air Force did not want the plane. The Air Force mothballed the C-27s in the desert before any of them flew a single operational mission, costing taxpayers $631 million.\n\nThe DoD is not the only entity implicated in the report. The State Department spent $630,000 to attract followers to its Facebook and Twitter accounts, NASA is spending $3 million to study how Congress works, the National Endowment for the Humanities spent nearly a million dollars over three years to explore the origins of popular romance in multi-media, and taxpayers have so far spent $319 million to build the Healthcare.gov website, with estimates projecting more than twice that will be spent on publicity and marketing.\n\nCoburn does not attribute the waste to the agencies but to Congress. \"The reason it's hard work to cut spending is because somebody's ox gets gored,\" he said. \"Somebody doesn't get money.\" He added, \"Most members of Congress are more interested in getting themselves re-elected than they are in fixing what's wrong with the country.\"\n\nCoburn's report does not spare either party, with the Senate Majority Leader \u2013 Harry Reid (D-Nev.) \u2013 being specifically mentioned for his refusal to adhere to regular order and bring appropriations bills to the floor, contributing to Congress's lax oversight of federal government spending in 2013.",
    " Title: Notre Dame Conference Aims to Bridge Political Polarization Among American Catholics\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( Religion News Service ) - A diverse group of Catholic leaders gathered at the University of Notre Dame last week to discuss the impact of political polarization on Catholic life in the United States. Under the theme \"Naming the Wounds, Beginning to Heal,\" the conference aimed to change the tone of political engagement among priests, laypeople, and the hierarchy.\n\nWhat sets the Notre Dame conference apart is its focus on engaging the reality of polarization rather than merely lamenting it. The United States now has two parties that are ideologically distinct on a range of issues, and partisanship is a deeply ingrained social identity for many.\n\nConservative evangelicals align with the Republican Party's social conservatism and sexual traditionalism, while mainstream Protestant denominations support the Democratic Party's platform, including abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Moderate evangelicals, black Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox traditions span both major parties, but the Catholic Church's political landscape is particularly wide-ranging.\n\nRobert McElroy, the newly installed Catholic bishop of San Diego, delivered a speech last year on the moral dilemmas of partisanship. While acknowledging the role parties play in fostering mass participation in politics, he cautioned against their potential hostility towards human dignity and the common good.\n\nFor Christian citizens, parties present a paradox. While it is good to have ideologically distinct parties that pursue different policy goals when in power, partisans who abandon their religious principles to align with their party undermine Christian political engagement.\n\nAmerican Catholics are acutely aware of how political polarization strains their church and their consciences. However, unlike religious ideologues on the right and left, they are uneasy with this new development. Neither major party offers a platform that aligns with Catholic values on issues such as the unborn, the poor, the environment, and access to healthcare.\n\nIt is unrealistic to expect a Catholic-friendly Christian Democrat party to emerge in the U.S., or for today's ideologues to support it. Some Catholics prefer to support specific policies that align with Catholic values rather than identifying with a political party. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has generally followed this path, but most Catholics will continue to identify as Republicans or Democrats.\n\nCatholics should strive to create space in both parties for the full expression of Catholic social teaching. By elevating principles above party loyalty, they can witness to their faith and model authentically Christian political engagement.\n\nCatholic social teaching, with its emphasis on human dignity and the common good, offers a comprehensive and authentic \"Christian\" ethic compared to secular ideologies and other churches' political pronouncements. The Catholic Church's political thinking is admired by many non-Catholics for its \"consistent ethic of life.\"\n\nPolarization poses a unique challenge to Catholics, and they should seek ways to promote fuller expressions of their church's humane teachings in both parties. Jacob Lupfer, a contributing editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgetown University, emphasizes the importance of this endeavor.

    " Title: GOP Seizes Political Opportunity in Health Care Ruling, Framing Mandate as a Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to uphold President Barack Obama's health care law, the initial reaction from Republican leaders was one of shock. However, as the tax implications of the individual mandate became clear, they saw a potential political win. The GOP's talking points now revolve around criticizing the health care mandate as a tax.\n\nAccording to House GOP sources, Republican leaders were prepared for various outcomes from the high court, but they were taken aback when they learned that conservative Chief Justice John Roberts was the deciding vote. As the details of the ruling sunk in, they realized they might have lost at the court but won politically.\n\nThe chief justice decided that the individual mandate, which required Americans to carry health insurance, was a tax, a power that Congress was allowed to levy. Republicans seized on this argument and plan to use it to their advantage.\n\nThe high court's decision validated one of the main points the GOP made against the health care bill throughout the 2009 debate. It provided a message they could hammer from now until Election Day: Democrats want to tax Americans, and unless Mitt Romney is in the White House and the GOP holds the House and Senate, they will do it again.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, in a meeting with top House GOP leaders and aides, compared the government's ability to tax individuals for not having health insurance to the government taxing people for not eating broccoli on Tuesday. He stated that while he didn't think it was a wise law, it was not unconstitutional.\n\nRepublican leaders have announced they will follow through on their pledge to repeal the law or any piece of it if it is upheld. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the House would again vote to roll back the health care law after its weeklong Fourth of July recess.\n\nThe closed-door meeting to discuss the court's ruling was described as \"a little bit somber\" by Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador. He said the court's decision \"was a little bit surprising.\" However, Labrador quickly pivoted to the tax message, stating, \"The bottom line is that the Supreme Court has said now that Congress has the authority and power to tax everyone for anything at any time, and the American people should be afraid of that.\"\n\nDuring the health care debate in 2009, President Obama argued that the individual mandate was not a tax. In an interview with ABC, Obama said, \"For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it's saying is, is that we're not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase.\"\n\nRepublican congressional aides had already planned to make repealing health care a centerpiece of their fall campaign message. However, Roberts' decision gave them new ammunition and talking points in an area\u2014taxes\u2014where public opinion polls frequently show the Democratic Party can be vulnerable.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would not directly answer when asked about the court's ruling that the mandate in the health care law was a tax. \"Call it what you will, it is a step forward for America's families,\" Pelosi said. She downplayed the new debate over Roberts' decision as \"Washington talk\" and emphasized the benefits of the law for those with pre-existing conditions who will now be able to get coverage.\n\nWhile the GOP moves to reframe the debate over health care, Democrats criticize Republicans for ignoring the economy and re-fighting a battle from two years ago. The Democratic campaign committee blasted out press releases about the 60 House Republicans it is targeting in November.\n\nJesse Ferguson, the spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of freshman Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin, \"Rather than working to create jobs by strengthening the middle class, Congressman Duffy wants to put insurance companies back in charge of health care: taking away critical patient protections, denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, heart disease or cancer and raising prescription drug costs for seniors.\"",
    " Title: Should You Wear a Mask During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Understanding the WHO's Guidelines and the Types of Masks Available\n\nIn the ongoing battle against COVID-19, the question of whether to wear a mask has become a topic of discussion for many. While in Asia, masks are a common sight, their usage in Europe and the United States is less prevalent. However, with the increasing spread of the virus, the question of mask-wearing during the pandemic has become a pressing one.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of masks is recommended only under specific circumstances. These include:\n\n1. If you are caring for someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n2. If you are coughing or sneezing yourself, or suspect you might have COVID-19.\n\nMasks work by capturing droplets that are dispersed in coughs, sneezes, and breath, which are the main transmission routes of the new coronavirus.\n\nThere are two main types of masks: surgical masks and close-fitting ones, sometimes called respirators. Close-fitting masks, such as N95 masks, can offer good, but not total, protection against infectious droplets. The next rank up, the N99-rated masks, can provide better protection, but some find them difficult to breathe through.\n\nThe \"N\" rating refers to the percentage of particles of at least 0.3 microns in diameter that the mask is designed to block. N95 masks stop 95% and N99 masks stop 99%. Some masks have a valve in the front to prevent moisture in exhaled breath from condensing on the inside, making the mask wet and more susceptible to virus penetration.\n\nMasks are only effective if combined with frequent handwashing and ensuring you don't touch your face. Anyone using a mask should make sure their hands are thoroughly cleaned with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before putting it on. The mask should cover your mouth and nose, and there should be no gaps between your face and the mask. When the mask becomes damp, replace it with a new one. Do not reuse single-use masks.\n\n\"Wearing a mask can also reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces, which happens many more times a day than we all realize and is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene,\" said Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at Leeds University's Institute of Medical Research.",
    " Title: U.S. Conducts Over 80% of Multi-National Air Strikes Against Islamic State\n\nThe United States is leading the majority of the air strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to the latest Pentagon report. The report, obtained by FoxNews.com, indicates that U.S. fighter planes and drones have conducted 819 strikes, compared to 157 from the 10 other countries participating in the coalition.\n\nThe U.S. began the strikes in Iraq on Aug. 8, and was joined by Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom approximately five weeks later. Canada joined on Oct. 7, and was the last to launch a strike. France was the first Western country, other than the U.S., to launch an air strike, on Sept. 17, destroying an Islamic State depot.\n\nThe U.S. ordered the strikes in Syria on Sept. 23, following an agreement by five Arab nations - Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates - to participate. The five other countries flying attacks in Iraq have committed at least 30 fighter jets and four support aircraft. Their missions have destroyed Islamic State military equipment such as vehicles and depots, and at least one mission last month targeted a captured oil refinery, according to a top Australian military official.\n\nHowever, U.S. military officials have released few specifics about the missions, including information about the accuracy of the strikes, which has been questioned. U.S. Central Command did not respond to several requests for information about strike accuracy and why the U.S. flies the vast majority of the sorties.\n\nDavid Johnson, vice admiral of the Royal Australian Air Force, recently told The Guardian that he wouldn't discuss enemy casualties or target locations for fear of Islamic State's \"aggressive propaganda campaign.\" Another challenge is that pilots, out of concern for killing civilians, have only a limited number of targets and reportedly can attack only at night.\n\nAnother issue is that Islamic State, a combination of a country and an army, presents an elusive and unconventional target. Dakota Wood, a defense expert at the Heritage Foundation and retired Marine Corps special operations officer, said that the decisions about which countries will fly which missions or how many missions involve several logistical and political factors.\n\n\"You have to find the right pilot to execute a mission in a given tactical environment, which includes fuel time, moving targets, and anti-air defenses. This takes a certain amount of skill,\" Wood said.\n\nWood also noted that the other countries could have joined in the effort under limited rules of engagement, like Germany did in the war in Afghanistan. He said, for example, that the Arab nations might not be willing to attack vehicles because such a strike would kill a lot of fighters.\n\nAnother possibility is that Central Command could be marshaling the majority of sorties to U.S. pilots, Wood said. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is among those expressing concern about the challenges of zeroing in on ISIL or ISIS, as Islamic State is also known.\n\n\"We need more targeting capability,\" Inhofe recently told The New York Times.\n\nThat the combined 10 other countries have flown fewer attack missions is perhaps no surprise, considering the U.S. essentially has the world's biggest, most powerful military - including roughly 4,800 attack and fighter planes among more than 13,600 aircraft. That's compared to the Royal Bahraini Air Force, which reportedly has less than 50 planes capable of dropping bombs on strategic enemy targets.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press Sunday that U.S.-led coalition warplanes carried out as many as 30 airstrikes overnight against ISIS militants in and around the group's de facto capital of Raqqa, in northeastern Syria, which brings the total to roughly 1,000. The Local Coordination Committees, a collective of activists, also confirmed the airstrikes, but neither group had casualty figures and the strikes were not confirmed by the U.S. military.",
    " Title: Obama Steps Up Efforts to Promote Obamacare as Enrollment Period Begins\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from his past approach, President Barack Obama is taking a more active role in promoting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as the enrollment period begins. The White House is planning a coordinated strategy to involve President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Jill Biden in a push to sell Obamacare.\n\nThis new phase, which resembles a political campaign's early voting drive, will span the six-month enrollment period. The administration will strategically deploy the Obamas and Bidens, monitoring the turnout in key states and sending them to weaker markets to boost enrollment numbers.\n\nPresident Obama's increased engagement contrasts with his previous, more distant approach to the law since the contentious legislative battle ended in 2010. In the past three years, he has focused on other priorities, rarely referring to Obamacare.\n\nHowever, in the last month, Obama has made several public appearances to promote the new health benefits, including on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" a videoconference with state health officials, a weekly address dedicated to the law, and a tweet with Katy Perry.\n\nThe increased involvement comes at a crucial time, as the unpopular law enters the public spotlight. It also signifies the stakes for Obama: this is his opportunity to prove critics wrong and begin improving public opinion if the rollout meets expectations.\n\nObama has emphasized the October 1st enrollment start date in recent interviews, but he is unlikely to mark it as a significant milestone, given the possibility of a government shutdown due to congressional gridlock. The White House wants to keep the president's schedule flexible in case of a shutdown.\n\nIn recent months, Obama has not only increased his public discussions of the law but has also dedicated more of his behind-the-scenes attention to its implementation. He regularly meets with health policy aides for extended sessions in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.\n\nThe first day of enrollment marks a significant milestone for Obama's signature domestic achievement, but it is not being celebrated as a definitive benchmark, despite the president's recent emphasis on the date. The White House is cautious about over-hyping the first day, acknowledging that glitches and problems are likely, and coverage does not begin until January 1. At least one state, Oregon, has delayed opening its exchanges until mid-October.",
    " Title: The State of American Labor Movement: A Tale of Decline and Resurgence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of a weakened private-sector union movement, government employee unions have emerged as the most powerful force within the labor movement. This shift has not gone unnoticed by anti-union billionaires and foundations, who have used the Janus case to undermine the strongest part of the labor movement.\n\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court does not bode well for workers and unions. In a 2014 opinion, Kavanaugh, in an apparent nod to 19th-century state court rulings, argued that the Labor Department was wrong to fine SeaWorld for the death of a trainer killed by an orca whale. He suggested that the Labor Department should not regulate the safety of SeaWorld's trainers, likening their work to that of tiger tamers and bull riders who accept the risks inherent in hazardous professions.\n\nThe labor movement may see some growth due to President Trump's efforts to boost coal, steel, and aluminum production, as well as his push to renegotiate NAFTA to stimulate domestic auto production. These initiatives could potentially create tens of thousands of jobs in the mining and manufacturing sectors, but the losses from the Janus ruling are expected to far outweigh these gains, with some experts estimating that over a million workers will leave their unions in the coming years.\n\nThere is some positive news for labor. A new Gallup Poll shows that public approval for unions has reached its highest level in 15 years. Unions have also scored victories in sectors such as academia, journalism, and service industries, with adjunct professors, journalists, graduate teaching assistants, nurses, bus drivers, and service-sector workers in Silicon Valley unionizing.\n\nDespite decades of employer resistance and the Trump administration's hostility, unions are struggling to reverse their decline. If the American labor movement fails to rebound, it could lead to increased income inequality, wage stagnation, and further corporate control.\n\nSteven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is writing a book about the history and future of the American labor movement.",
    " Title: The Dishonest Bipartisan Approach to Healthcare Policy: A Critical Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing saga of healthcare policy in Washington D.C. has been marked by a persistent lack of transparency and honesty, rather than the elusive bipartisan cooperation that many have longed for. This article aims to shed light on the dishonest bipartisan approach that has characterized the healthcare debate, moving away from the call for a return to the mythical bipartisan ideal.\n\nFor the past decade, the healthcare policy discourse has been marred by political posturing and broken promises. The Republican Party's seven-year campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) serves as a prime example of this trend. Many of these politicians used the repeal pledge as a sales pitch, only to abandon it after the election.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Party is not exempt from criticism. Obamacare itself was passed with a series of promises, such as \"You can keep your plan!\", \"You can keep your doctor!\", and \"Your premiums won't go up!\", that have proven to be false. If these promises were even remotely true, Obamacare would not be in the state it is today.\n\nThe recent debates over the Republican \"repeal and replace\" bills have not resulted in the repeal of Obamacare, as many Republicans claimed. Instead, these bills kept most of its regulations intact, particularly the popular ones. The GOP did seek to reform the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, but this is not the same as repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe dishonesty extends to the White House as well. President Donald Trump has shown a lack of preference for specific policies or approaches during these debates, only wanting the bragging rights that come with a repeal. The Democrats, aware of the political burden that Obamacare represents for their party, have been equally determined to deny Trump the ability to claim a repeal.\n\nThis polarized, tribal climate in Washington is frustrating, as it often results in a battle of liars protecting past lies in the hope of making new lies seem plausible enough to continue the cycle. The Medicaid fight, while real, is the exception rather than the rule. The majority of this political theater is a charade, with both parties prioritizing political gain over the well-being of the American people.\n\nAs the debate over healthcare policy continues, it is crucial to recognize and address the dishonest bipartisan approach that has plagued this issue for far too long. The American people deserve honesty, transparency, and genuine efforts to improve their healthcare system, rather than political posturing and broken promises.",
    " Title: Majority of Democratic Voters Support Clinton's Presidential Bid Despite Email Scandal, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Rasmussen, a strong majority of Democratic voters have expressed their support for Hillary Clinton to continue her presidential campaign, even if she is indicted in connection with her private email use while serving as Secretary of State. The poll, released on Tuesday, found that 71% of Democratic voters believe Clinton should continue her campaign, a view shared by only 30% of Republicans and 46% of unaffiliated voters. Overall, 50% of those polled said Clinton should keep running.\n\nLast week, the State Department inspector general report criticized Clinton's email use, finding that repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told to stop discussing the Secretary's personal email system. The FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices is still ongoing.\n\nDemocratic primary rival Bernie Sanders has avoided commenting specifically on the ongoing FBI probe, but his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, on Wednesday questioned whether Clinton could continue her campaign if an indictment is handed down. \"That would be difficult to continue running a race,\" Weaver told a news outlet on Wednesday.\n\nThe email scandal could still be problematic for Clinton's general election hopes, with 40% of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of it. However, 48% of voters said the email scandal would have no impact on their vote.\n\nThe poll also found that 65% of voters consider it likely that Clinton broke the law with her email use, with 47% saying it's very likely. The Democratic primary frontrunner's argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is not swaying many voters.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 29-30 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Expands Use of DNA Tests to Expedite Family Reunification of Separated Migrant Families\n\nThe United States government, under a court order to swiftly reunite parents and children who were separated after crossing the border illegally from Mexico, has increased its reliance on DNA tests to establish paternity in immigration matters.\n\nAccording to government officials, DNA testing is a more expedient method of confirming parentage compared to gathering documents such as birth certificates. The use of DNA testing in immigration matters was rare during the Obama administration, but it was occasionally employed as a last resort to verify family connections when placing unaccompanied minors with sponsors in the United States.\n\nThe testing process involves analyzing a small portion of DNA, known as \"short tandem repeats,\" to identify inherited regions of DNA that can vary from person to person. In a court filing made on Thursday, U.S. Health and Human Services official Jonathan White described the testing as a \"faster but costlier method for confirming parentage than collecting and assessing documentation and anecdotal information.\"\n\nThe filing was submitted in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on behalf of parents who were separated from their children by immigration officials. The judge in that case has ordered that children under the age of 5 be reunited with their parents by Tuesday, and that all minors separated from their parents be reunited by July 26.\n\nIn his declaration, White stated that field teams are taking swabs from the cheeks of children and adults and sending them to a third-party laboratory for analysis. The process takes approximately a week, he said, though verification can take longer. LabCorp, one of the largest providers of DNA testing to prove parentage, and DNA Diagnostics, another company certified for DNA testing, did not respond to requests for comment on their involvement in the current testing of immigrant parents and children.\n\nDave Silver, marketing director at DNA Diagnostics, stated that the company's tests to identify relatives can cost in the \"hundreds of dollars,\" due in part to expenses associated with ensuring \"chain of custody\" for the DNA. After the company conducts a DNA test at its laboratory, a written report is generally issued to whoever purchased the test, and the collected DNA is destroyed after six months.\n\n\"DNA testing is the method of parental verification most likely to protect children from harm given the compressed time frame imposed by the court's order,\" White said in his declaration. The testing is just one part of the reunification process, White added. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security assesses parental fitness and potential child endangerment.\n\nNeither the Health and Human Services Department nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests for information on the testing.",
    " Title: 2012 Presidential Race: A Record Degree of Triviality in the Smallest Campaign Ever\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential race is being described as the smallest campaign ever, with strategists and observers agreeing that it has reached a record degree of triviality. The campaign, which was once envisioned as a titanic clash of media-swarmed combatants with big ideas about the future, has instead unfolded as a grinding, joyless slog.\n\nUnlike previous small-ball presidential campaigns, this race is being fought hour by hour in 140-character Twitter increments and blink-and-you-miss-it cable segments. The endless flood of caustic television ads and daily trench warfare has left both the Obama and Romney campaigns strafing each other on Twitter, while decrying the campaign's lack of serious ideas for a serious time.\n\nAt most junctures when they've had the opportunity to go big, they've chosen to go small. President Obama has spoken in broad strokes about his accomplishments but has not yet outlined a detailed agenda for a second term. Mitt Romney has openly declared that he will not detail his policy proposals, such as slashing the size of government, to avoid giving his opponents ammunition.\n\nInstead, they have embraced a campaign that has been defined almost entirely by tactics and daily trench warfare, whether that's the chair of the Democratic Party labeling Romney a \"job cremator\" or the Romney campaign driving its campaign bus in circles around an Obama event honking the horn, in a stunt right out of a third-tier frat house.\n\nTodd Purdum, the Vanity Fair editor and former New York Times White House reporter, said, \"Both campaigns right now are in a kind of defensive crouch. They're both very tightly clenched and I don't think either one sees any advantage in talking expansively or philosophically.\"\n\nDan Rather, the longtime national news anchor who now hosts HDNet's \"Dan Rather Reports,\" added, \"For the first time in my memory, we have a presidential race in which neither one of these candidates really likes to campaign. They're not naturals like a Ronald Reagan or a Bill Clinton.\"\n\nThe expanding and hyperactive press corps doesn't help matters, Rather said. \"You have not just a 24-hour news cycle but a deadline every nanosecond.... So much of the reporting focuses on who said what in the last five minutes and who said what in response to that,\" he explained, musing that the tenor of the race could change after Labor Day. \"I think reporters, together with the inaccessibility of candidates, get caught up in a kind of ennui, if you will\u2014it's probably the only French word you'll ever hear me use\u2014and we are only in June.\"",
    " Title: Vice President Biden Advocates for Amnesty, Sparks Controversy over Deportation Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at Miami Dade College on Saturday, Vice President Joe Biden may have prematurely announced the Obama administration's plans to formally review and potentially alter its deportation policies. The vice president, who has previously expressed support for amnesty for illegal immigrants, reportedly responded to a shout of \"Stop deportations!\" from the audience by stating, \"We'll do that, too, kid, but let me finish my speech.\"\n\nThe statement comes after amnesty legislation stalled in Congress earlier this year, leading to criticism of President Barack Obama as the \"deporter in chief\" by pro-amnesty activists. However, mainstream press reports from the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times have debunked the notion that the Obama administration's deportation policies are unprecedented.\n\nThe Obama administration has reportedly initiated an administrative review of the country's deportation laws, with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson meeting with advocacy groups to consider administrative actions such as granting more forms of amnesty, not deporting illegal immigrants who have not committed \"major\" crimes, and allowing bond hearings for illegal immigrants.\n\nTwenty-two senators recently wrote a letter to President Obama denouncing his administration's actions as a threat to the \"entire constitutional system\" and the \"rule of law.\" The senators argued that the administration's actions demonstrate a \"disregard for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the rights of American citizens and legal residents.\"\n\nIn addition, Biden reportedly praised Florida for becoming the 20th state to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, a move that could cost taxpayers up to $50 million.\n\nIn 2012, Biden also made headlines for declaring his support for gay marriage before President Obama had a chance to formally announce his \"evolution\" on the issue, a move that reportedly led to a temporary freeze in Biden's public appearances.\n\nThe vice president's comments at Miami Dade College have sparked controversy and debate over the Obama administration's immigration policies, with some praising Biden's advocacy for amnesty and others criticizing the potential erosion of the nation's immigration laws.",
    " Title: Trump's Personal Lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Admits to Pushing for Ukraine Ambassador's Removal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of public statements over the past week, former New York Mayor and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted to pushing for the removal of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Giuliani stated that he believed Yovanovitch was an obstacle to his efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations aimed at helping Trump politically.\n\nGiuliani's admission comes after the House of Representatives impeached Trump on Wednesday, with only one non-Democrat, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), voting in favor of impeachment. The impeachment charges stem from Trump's alleged abuse of power by withholding a White House meeting and vital military aid until Ukraine opened investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee server is secretly in Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani's admission is consistent with a tactic used by Trump and his administration throughout the president's term: admitting to controversial acts, despite denying them before, and counting on loyalists in Congress and conservative media to defend them.\n\nIn addition to Giuliani's admission, there have been several other confessions from Trump and his top aides regarding the impeachment inquiry.\n\n1. On October 3, Trump admitted to pushing Zelensky to investigate Biden, and continued to urge such a probe. Trump also urged China to open its own investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who had business in China while Biden was vice president.\n2. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney copped to a \"quid pro quo\" involving military aid during an October 17 press conference. Mulvaney later denied that he had admitted to a quid pro quo.\n3. US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland made it clear during his November 20 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that Trump refused to give Zelensky a White House meeting until Zelensky announced the investigations Trump wanted.\n4. Sondland was less clear on Trump ordering a hold on military aid, but Trump helped clarify the issue when he called into Fox & Friends. Trump stated that the administration was looking for corruption and that there was tremendous corruption in Ukraine.\n5. Since returning from a trip to Ukraine earlier this month, Giuliani has volunteered new details on his smear campaign against Yovanovitch. He has admitted that he worked to force her firing because she posed an obstacle to Ukraine announcing the Biden and DNC server investigations he was helping Trump try to secure.\n\nGiuliani's statements are admissions that he influenced US foreign policy to cause Ukraine to announce investigations intended to help Trump in 2020. However, Giuliani has offered no credible evidence for his attacks on Yovanovitch. The Republican-led Senate will have to decide if they agree with Giuliani and Trump's actions.",
    " Title: Trump Urges GOP Critics to Move Past Controversial Judge Remarks, Maintains Fair Trial Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump expressed his desire for his fellow Republicans to move past the controversy surrounding his comments about a judge's Mexican heritage overseeing a case against Trump University.\n\n\"I don't care where the judge comes from or where judges come from - I just want to get a fair shake,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we've had some very unfair opinions coming down, and you wonder what's going on.\"\n\nMr. Trump has previously stated that Indiana-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel has a conflict of interest in the case due to his Mexican heritage and Trump's pledge to build a wall along the United States' southern border.\n\nSeveral Republicans, including former 2016 GOP candidates Jeb Bush and John Kasich, have criticized Mr. Trump for these remarks. In response, Mr. Trump expressed some disappointment and noted the animosity among some Republicans.\n\n\"They just can't come back. They can't get over it,\" he said. \"So they have to get over it, ideally. As to whether or not they endorse me, it's okay if they don't. But they have to get over it. They shouldn't be so angry for so long.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tight re-election battle this year in Illinois, also announced that Mr. Trump's comments about the judge, along with other attacks, led him to the point where he will not support the presumptive nominee. Kirk had previously stated he would support Mr. Trump if he was the nominee.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Trump stated that his comments had been \"misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage.\" He added, \"I do not feel that one's heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.\"",
    " Title: Independent Investigative Agency Finds Kellyanne Conway Violated Hatch Act Twice\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel (OSC) announced on Tuesday that senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews last November and December. The OSC stated that Conway impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the first interview, Conway advocated against one Senate candidate and gave an implied endorsement of another candidate. In the second interview, she advocated for the defeat of one Senate candidate and the election of another candidate. The interviews occurred during President Donald Trump's support for Judge Roy Moore in Alabama's U.S. Senate special election.\n\nDuring her \"Fox and Friends\" interview, Conway stated, \"Doug Jones in Alabama, folks don\u2019t be fooled, he\u2019ll be a vote against tax cuts. He\u2019s weak on crime, weak on borders. He\u2019s strong on raising your taxes. He\u2019s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he\u2019s not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.\"\n\nThe OSC report has been referred to President Trump, but the White House quickly disputed the OSC finding, making it unlikely Conway will face any serious discipline. The OSC report claims the office gave Conway ample opportunity to respond to their report, which included a commitment from the White House counsel's office that Conway never followed through on.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, wants the president to take disciplinary action against Conway. Cummings stated, \"This is not the first time that an independent government agency has recommended that the White House discipline Kellyanne Conway for breaking the law. Ms. Conway has received multiple trainings and warnings, yet she still refuses to follow basic ethics rules. The President must take swift and serious disciplinary action against Ms. Conway. Anything else sets a terrible example.\"\n\nThe Hatch Act, which dates back to 1939, is intended to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation. There are a few exceptions to the rule, including the president, vice president, and some other federal employees.\n\nIn early 2017, Conway was similarly found to have violated federal ethics rules in an appearance on \"Fox and Friends\" when she urged viewers to purchase items from Ivanka Trump's clothing line. No significant disciplinary action was taken as a response. Conway is not the first Trump White House official to be found in violation of the Hatch Act. Social media director Dan Scavino was issued a warning by the OSC after writing a tweet from his personal verified account against Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., calling for his defeat in a primary.",
    " Title: Arizona Senators and Representatives Divided on Family Separation Policy at U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nArticle:\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has condemned the Trump administration's practice of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border, marking a break within Republican ranks on the controversial policy.\n\nThree of Arizona's five GOP House members have remained silent on the \"zero tolerance\" crackdown that has resulted in an estimated 2,000 children being separated from their families. By contrast, all four of the state's U.S. House Democrats have criticized the practice in recent days.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) hinted at his dismay in questions about the policy he put to the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nIn a blistering tweet on Monday evening, McCain said, \"The administration's current family separation policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and contrary to principles and values upon which our nation was founded. The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do so now.\"\n\nThe family separations have sparked a national outcry and emerged as a searing test of how far Americans are willing to go in their efforts to enforce immigration and border control. The White House itself has offered conflicting accounts of the policy and the reasons behind it. Officials have alternately\u2014and falsely\u2014blamed Democrats for it, denied there is a separation policy, or suggested the policy is intended as a deterrent to reduce illegal immigration.\n\nAs the administration founders, congressional Republicans have done what they have often done in other high-profile spasms of controversies involving President Donald Trump: They waited.\n\nU.S. Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), a Republican whose Tucson-based district includes part of the border with Mexico, issued a statement that suggests she does not like the separation tactics but does not find fault with the Trump administration.\n\n\"We need to enforce our laws in a consistent and humane manner, and (Homeland Security) should not have to choose between enforcing the law and keeping children with their parents,\" she said. \"My immigration bill, which I've been working on since last September, fixes this by allowing children to stay with their parents as they undergo due process. I hope we can get a version of my bill out of the House this week and on the President's desk immediately to address many urgent issues like this.\"\n\nWhile McSally did not challenge the administration, one of her Democratic opponents in the race for the state's open Senate seat, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), did.\n\n\"The administration's choice to separate families at the border is wrong\u2014they should stop immediately. I'm ready to work with anyone to fix our broken immigration system, secure our border, & protect our communities,\" she wrote in a tweet.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) pointed the blame at former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"The Obama Admin's lack of enforcement of our immigration laws is responsible for this crisis,\" he said in a tweet. \"The (Justice Department's) zero-tolerance policy returns to the rule of law & ensures families are no longer lured to our borders with false promises. Elections matter.\"\n\nMcCain and Flake are Republicans who have cast themselves as the conscience of their party as their congressional careers wind down. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer; Flake is not seeking re-election this year.\n\nEnsuring the safety and security of young children is a longstanding priority of the American legal system, said Flake. \"In asylum cases, it is especially important to keep families together when neither the child nor the parent has violated any laws. Contrary to what (Homeland Security) has indicated as proper procedure, we are currently seeing cases where immigrant families seeking asylum are separated after lawfully presenting themselves at a U.S. port of entry.\"\n\nAs the separation story gathered steam last week, U.S. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) repeatedly hammered the White House for its actions. He elaborated in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"As children are ripped from their parents' arms, and mass trials and gross violations of due process permeate the border region, Trump and his henchmen continue their macabre public relations tour to justify their abhorrent policies that attack asylum seekers and innocent children. In the process, Trump has reached a disgusting new low by using asylum seekers and their children as leverage to get his border wall,\" Grijalva said.\n\n\"Current anti-immigrant legislation like the Goodlatte/McSally bill and the Republican 'compromise' have nothing to do with the refugee crisis at the southern border. By holding the children seeking asylum hostage, Trump and his baby snatchers are lying to the American people.\"",
    " Title: Federal Judge Allows Lawsuit Alleging Trump's Alleged Emoluments Clause Violation to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a federal judge on Wednesday dismissed President Donald Trump's latest attempt to halt a lawsuit accusing him of violating the Constitution's emoluments clause by conducting business with foreign governments. The ruling, made by Judge Peter J. Messitte in a Maryland court, allows the plaintiffs, Maryland and the District of Columbia's attorneys general, to proceed with their case.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Trump has violated the Constitution's little-used emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting emoluments, or undue payments, from foreign governments, kings, princes, or foreign states. The plaintiffs aim to question Trump Organization employees and examine company records to determine which foreign countries have spent money at Trump's Washington hotel.\n\nThe Justice Department and Trump's attorneys have yet to respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post. The Trump team could appeal the decision and request that Judge Messitte delay granting the attorneys general access to Trump Organization employees and records until the appeal is decided.\n\nThe emoluments clause was designed to prevent U.S. ambassadors overseas from being influenced by European powers. However, the modern interpretation of the clause has been unclear due to the fact that most presidents, unlike Trump, do not run or take part in running their businesses while in office.\n\nTrump maintains ownership of his business empire, including more than 10 hotels and golf clubs worldwide. Although Trump has stated that he relinquished day-to-day management of his businesses, he still owns them and can withdraw money from them at any time, according to the DC paper.\n\nA number of foreign governments have reportedly spent substantial amounts at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, located just a few blocks from the White House. The hotel has rented out ballrooms to Kuwait and the Philippines and hosted leaders from Malaysia and Romania.\n\nThe plaintiffs may also seek access to Trump's tax returns, which he has refused to disclose, fueling speculation that the president may have something to hide.",
    " Title: University of Illinois Student Ruth George Strangled and Sexually Assaulted in Parking Garage, Suspect Arrested\n\nArticle:\n\nA tragic incident occurred at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) early Saturday morning, resulting in the death of 19-year-old honor roll student Ruth George. According to prosecutors, George was strangled and sexually assaulted in a parking garage by Donald Thurman, a 26-year-old man who had been released from prison in December after serving two years of a six-year sentence for armed robbery.\n\nGeorge was walking alone to her car in the UIC parking garage when Thurman began following and catcalling her. Ignoring him, as many women do in similar situations, George continued to her car. However, the situation escalated when Thurman, reportedly angered by being ignored, approached George, put her in a chokehold, and then allegedly threw her in the backseat of her car while she was unconscious. George's family grew concerned when she did not return home and reported their concerns to UIC police. Tracing her cellphone to the parking garage, George's sisters and UIC police found her body in the backseat. She died from strangulation, a medical examiner confirmed.\n\nThurman was arrested on Sunday and charged with first-degree murder and aggravated sexual assault. A judge ordered Thurman to be held without bail on Tuesday. During the hearing, Cook County prosecutors described the chilling circumstances that led to George's death. Thurman, who saw George walking to the UIC parking garage around 1:25 a.m. on Saturday, \"thought she was pretty\" and tried to talk to her, prosecutors said in court documents. While ignoring Thurman's catcalls and efforts to talk to her, George walked to her car, which is when she was allegedly put in a chokehold. With his arms still around George's neck, Thurman allegedly dragged her from the ground and threw her in the backseat. She was unconscious when Thurman raped her, prosecutors said. When George's sisters and UIC police found her body, she was cold and unresponsive. Her sisters tried to resuscitate her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities also recovered a condom and semen in the car.\n\nSurveillance camera footage showed Thurman, wearing a \"distinguishable white jacket,\" following George into the parking garage and running away from it 35 minutes later, authorities said. On Sunday, Thurman was spotted in the area and arrested. He admitted to choking George, throwing her in the car, and sexually assaulting her when she was unconscious, but \"denied having sexual intercourse with her,\" prosecutors said.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago community is in shock and mourning the loss of Ruth George. Counseling services are being made available to students, faculty, and staff. The university has also increased security measures in the affected area. The case is a grim reminder of the importance of personal safety, especially for women walking alone at night. The investigation is ongoing, and further details will be released as they become available.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Highlights: Ann Romney, Chris Christie, and Other Speakers to Take the Stage\n\nThe Republican National Convention, delayed by Hurricane Isaac, is set to commence in earnest this afternoon in Tampa, Florida. The following is a rundown of the day's schedule:\n\n- Potential Floor Fight: Following the Pledge of Allegiance, the National Anthem, and the invocation, a touch of old-fashioned debate may ensue. Supporters of Texas Representative Ron Paul are expected to voice their objections to new rules that would grant Republican presidential candidates more control over delegate selection. Although their objections are unlikely to lead to a significant uproar, they may still cause a murmur of dissent.\n\n- The Roll Call: In the late afternoon, delegates will undertake the convention's primary task\u2014officially nominating their candidates for president and vice president. The roll call is scheduled to conclude before 6:40 p.m. EST. The nominees are, of course, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for president and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for vice president.\n\n- Rick Santorum: The last major challenger to Romney's bid for the party's presidential nomination, Rick Santorum, is slated to address the delegates during the 7 p.m. EST hour. Santorum was a vocal advocate for the party's more conservative members during the primaries.\n\n- Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: Facing a recall vote after his controversial actions regarding public unions, Walker has emerged victorious. He is a hero to many within the party and will speak at the podium in the 8 p.m. EST hour.\n\n- Former Representative Artur Davis: Four years ago, Senator Joe Lieberman played the role of a former Democrat crossing over to the Republican side. This time, it will be former Alabama Congressman Artur Davis. He is scheduled to speak in the 9 p.m. EST hour.\n\n- Ann Romney: Widely regarded as her husband's most effective spokesperson, Ann Romney will discuss her husband in the 10 p.m. EST hour. It is possible that Mitt Romney may make an appearance in the hall. He is expected to be in Tampa briefly today before embarking on a nationwide campaign tour ahead of Thursday's acceptance speech.\n\n- New Jersey Governor Chris Christie: Recalling the Democratic convention in 2004 when a little-known Illinois senator named Barack Obama delivered the keynote address, Christie, who is better known than Obama was then, is expected to deliver a passionate and often humorous keynote address in the final hour before adjournment. The convention is scheduled to adjourn at 11 p.m. EST (or slightly later if the schedule runs behind\u2014however, recent Republican conventions have generally run on time).",
    " Title: Abortion Debate and Supreme Court Nomination: A Potential Game-Changer for Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over the Supreme Court and its potential impact on abortion rights is escalating, creating an unpredictable and volatile environment for incumbents in the midterm elections. The issue, which has not been as prominent in recent years, is now a key talking point for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats argue that the prospect of a Supreme Court nominee who could overturn the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion could mobilize their base, potentially hurting Republicans, particularly in the House. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake stated, \"Our biggest ally here is their own rhetoric because they\u2019re not trying to finesse this in any way. They\u2019re clear about their agenda.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, are confident that the issue will mobilize their own grassroots, which supported President Trump in 2016 partly due to his promises on Supreme Court nominees. A Senate Republican pollster noted, \"If you look at the way Trump won in 2016, a big part of that was energizing the evangelical base that didn\u2019t turn out in 2008 and 2012.\"\n\nThe potential impact of the abortion debate on the midterms is not limited to the Senate. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at The Cook Political Report, suggests that the battle could drive up Democratic turnout in districts won by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, it could also help Republicans maintain their Senate majority.\n\nThe Cook Political Report identifies four Republican toss-up seats in California, one in Colorado, two in Illinois, two in Minnesota, one in New Jersey, and two in New York. In the Senate, Republicans think a big battle over the court and abortion could cost Democrats seats they are defending this fall in Indiana, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Missouri, and possibly Montana.\n\nThe Democrats most at risk in an abortion fight are Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), whose home states are the least supportive of abortion rights among the Senate battlegrounds. In West Virginia, only 35 percent of adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll. In Indiana, 43 percent said it should be legal, while 51 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to have Trump\u2019s pick, which is slated to be announced on Monday, confirmed before the midterms. The outcome of the confirmation process could significantly impact the midterm elections, potentially \"firing up the Democratic base\" or \"waking up\" the Republican base, according to pollsters.\n\nAbortion rights could play out in different ways depending on the state. In Montana, more than 50 percent of voters favor abortion rights, which could help Sen. Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent there. In Arizona, 49 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a Pew poll.\n\nIn West Virginia, voters will also consider a state constitutional amendment declaring that \"nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" In Indiana, the issue is expected to weigh heavily on Sen. Joe Donnelly\u2019s reelection, especially given Vice President Pence's involvement in vetting potential Supreme Court nominees and his meeting with Trump to discuss the nominee.",
    " Title: Miller Affirms Commitment to Independence as Inspector General Amidst Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-hour confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Brian D. Miller, President Trump's nominee for the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Response, asserted his commitment to upholding the independence of the role, despite the ongoing political tensions surrounding the position.\n\nDuring the hearing, Miller clarified his stance on the $2 trillion CARES Act, stating that he intends to adhere to the act's requirement for the inspector general to report to Congress whenever investigative work is impeded. This stance contradicts President Trump's position, as expressed in a March 27 signing statement, which stated that the inspector general could not be required to report to Congress without \"presidential supervision.\"\n\nWhen questioned about potential pressure from the president or administration officials, Miller vowed to resist any attempts to undermine his independence. He cited his track record of battling with officials from the George W. Bush administration as a federal watchdog and stated that he would not \"bend\" for anyone in Trump's orbit.\n\nHowever, Miller declined to discuss his role in the recent dismissal of intelligence community watchdog Michael Atkinson or the president's move to sideline another watchdog, Glenn Fine. He also declined to comment on Trump's characterization of Atkinson as a \"disgrace to IGs.\"\n\nThe hearing sparked a series of questions from Democrats about Miller's independence, given his current role as a White House lawyer. Republicans, on the other hand, largely backed Miller, with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) dismissing such concerns as \"innuendo.\"\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, noted that only one inspector general candidate in the last 20 years was nominated while serving in the White House counsel's office, and another resigned due to a lack of independence.\n\nMiller and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) engaged in a heated exchange, with Warren pressing Miller to commit to investigating potential abuses. Miller eventually agreed that situations where companies were laying off employees while receiving bailout funds would be a matter of investigation.\n\nUnder questioning from Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Miller stated that all inspectors general should be willing to face firing for providing honest information to their superiors.\n\nMiller, who is likely to be confirmed in the Republican-controlled Senate, will oversee a $500-billion fund managed by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, intended to shore up companies and industries affected by the coronavirus crisis.\n\nIn response to questions from the committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Miller emphasized the importance of independence for the effective operation of any inspector general. He noted that he had faced resistance throughout his tenure as inspector general and had conducted investigations of major contractors, despite opposition from leaders at the General Services Administration.\n\nThe hearing marked the first time an inspector general nominee has come before the Senate since Trump began his efforts to remake the community of federal watchdogs and remove those he deemed as acting with an anti-Trump bias.",
    " Title: Obama Assures NATO Commitment, Addresses Greece's Economic Woes and Refugee Crisis in Final Foreign Trip\n\nArticle:\n\nATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 In his final foreign trip as president, Barack Obama reassured Greece of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO and offered support for the Greek people as they navigate economic woes and a refugee crisis during a meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos on Tuesday.\n\nObama emphasized the importance of a strong NATO, stating that it would provide \"significant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.\" Pavlopoulos, in turn, expressed confidence that President-elect Donald Trump would continue the same path.\n\nThe election of Trump has caused significant unease in Europe due to his campaign rhetoric suggesting the U.S. might withdraw from NATO if other countries do not contribute more. Obama's reassurances may be met with skepticism, as he had previously assured world leaders that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious in last week's election.\n\nIn addition to meeting with Pavlopoulos, Obama also held talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, offering support for the Greeks as they grapple with economic difficulties and a massive influx of refugees. Obama pledged to continue advocating for the view that \"austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity\" and that \"it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.\"\n\nObama and Tsipras were set to hold a joint news conference later in the day, and Pavlopoulos was hosting an official dinner for Obama at the presidential mansion in the evening.\n\nSecurity was tight for the two-day visit, with major roads closed along Obama's motorcade route, a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in central Athens and a southern suburb near a seaside luxury hotel where Obama was staying, and boats prohibited from sailing near the hotel's location. More than 5,000 police were deployed in the capital's streets for the visit, with left-wing and anarchist groups planning protest demonstrations for Tuesday afternoon, and an armed anarchist group calling for \"attacks and clashes\" to disrupt Obama's visit.\n\nObama is making the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to Greece since Bill Clinton in 1999. On Wednesday, Obama is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying to Berlin. From Germany, Obama will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday.\n\nGreece's government has hailed Obama's visit as being of \"huge importance\" for both Greece and Europe. The country's left-led coalition government has been struggling to pull Greece out of six years of a severe financial crisis that has devastated its economy and left more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed. Despite the U.S. election, the government has pinned its hopes on the U.S. president to help persuade some of the country's more reluctant international creditors, such as Germany, to grant it significant debt relief.\n\nWithout a cut in its debt, Athens says, it cannot hope to recover economically\u2014an argument also supported by the International Monetary Fund. Greece has been relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro bailouts from other European Union countries using the euro currency, and the IMF, since 2010. While the United States has not been involved in Greece's bailout, Athens has long seen it as an ally that could apply pressure on creditors.\n\nThe U.S. has praised Greek efforts to overhaul its economy but has repeatedly stressed the country must continue with painful reforms. The country's bailout funds are disbursed following reviews by international debt inspectors of mandated reforms.\n\nThe government will also be looking for recognition of the country's role in Europe's refugee crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands of refugees pass through Greece from Turkey on their way to the more prosperous countries of the European north, and for U.S. pressure on the rest of Europe to help shoulder the burden. Following the closure of Balkan land borders and the reluctance of some European countries to host refugees, more than 60,000 people are stranded in Greece, most living in poor conditions in overcrowded camps dotted around the country.\n\nRights organizations have urged Obama to use his visit to highlight these people's plight and Europe's response to the crisis. Amnesty International's Europe director, John Dalhuisen, said in a statement, \"Obama should shine the spotlight not only on abysmal conditions for the tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Greece, but also on the failure of world leaders to adequately address the wider global refugee crisis.\"",
    " Title: The Complexities of Gender-Affirmative Care for Transgender Youth: A Call for Informed Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe decision to administer estrogen or testosterone treatment to transgender youth is a significant one, with potential cosmetic changes that may be difficult to reverse, such as body fat redistribution and voice changes. Medical guidelines generally recommend that such treatments should not be initiated until the age of 16, or at the earliest, 14. However, existing data suggests that access to these treatments can lead to improved mental health for these young individuals.\n\nRecent attention has been drawn to the possibility of transgender youth choosing to discontinue estrogen or testosterone treatment. A case study published by a team from Harvard Medical School highlights a rare instance of an adolescent who started estrogen and later chose to stop. The young person reported that the trial of estrogen helped them better understand their gender identity, despite experiencing cosmetic changes to their body, primarily body fat and hair distribution.\n\nConversely, some youth may \"de-transition\" due to societal pressure to conform to cisgender norms. It is crucial to note that the regret often stems from the denial of medical care that could alleviate the distress caused by their biological puberty.\n\nThe potential benefits of providing gender-affirmative care generally outweigh the minor risks associated with treatment. These medications are administered only after thoughtful conversations between patient, family, and physician. Medical interventions are not initiated without the agreement and understanding of all three parties regarding the risks and benefits. Legislation that removes these decisions from families and physicians is potentially harmful.\n\nConservatives often use terms like \"sex change surgery\" to alarm the general public. Under current medical guidelines, genital surgeries for transgender patients are not offered before adulthood. The only surgeries that may be considered before adulthood are the removal of breast tissue, a procedure that requires careful evaluation before proceeding. Youth who require this surgery are often those who were unable to obtain puberty blockers, subsequently developed significant breast tissue, and had strong negative emotional reactions to their chest.

    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Suggests Miscalculation in Syrian Chemical Weapons Attack, According to Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - The United States has evidence and legal justification to carry out a military strike against Syria, according to administration officials, following a chemical weapons attack that left hundreds dead. However, the intelligence suggests that the attack may have been a miscalculation rather than a deliberate act of aggression.\n\nA key piece of the intelligence is an intercepted telephone call between Syrian military officials, one of whom seems to imply that the attack was more devastating than intended. \"It sounds like he thinks this was a small operation that got out of control,\" one intelligence official said.\n\nThe revelation comes as the U.S. prepares for potential military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The administration's stance is to deter Assad from using chemical weapons again.\n\nHowever, Republican lawmakers have expressed skepticism, suggesting that the scale of the attack was not a miscalculation but a deliberate act. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, stated, \"I'm comfortable that the things the president told Assad not to do he did.\"\n\nThe briefing, which included Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was unclassified, meaning the administration provided limited details about the intelligence bolstering the case for a military strike.\n\nPrior to the briefing, some lawmakers expressed frustration over the lack of consultation with Congress regarding the potential strike. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"When we take what is a very difficult decision, you have to have buy-in by members and buy-in by the public. I think both of those are critically important and, right now, none of that has happened.\"",
    " Title: Trump Excludes Romney from Coronavirus Task Force, Continuing Political Rift\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that further deepens the political divide between President Donald Trump and Senator Mitt Romney, the White House has excluded the Utah Senator from a task force focused on reopening America during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe only Republican senator not included in the president's \"Opening Up America Again Congressional Group\" is Romney, a vocal critic of the president within his own party. The task force is aimed at addressing the economic reopening strategies in the context of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nAn official confirmed to CNN that the president personally reviewed the list of invited lawmakers before its public release on Thursday. A spokesperson for Romney confirmed to The Hill that he was not asked to join the task force.\n\nThe rift between Trump and Romney dates back to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, when Romney, then a fellow Republican, made a speech urging Americans to strategically vote to prevent Trump from winning the party's nomination. Despite a brief reconciliation following Trump's election, with Trump considering Romney for a cabinet position and supporting Romney's Senate bid in 2018, the relationship has since soured.\n\nRomney's continued criticism of Trump in the media and his decision to be the sole Republican senator to vote for Trump's impeachment on abuse of power charges earlier this year have further strained their relationship. Trump has publicly labeled Romney as a \"Democrat secret asset,\" a \"failed presidential candidate,\" a \"Republican in name only,\" and \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.\"\n\nThis latest exclusion from the coronavirus task force underscores the ongoing political tension between the two, as the nation grapples with the economic and health challenges posed by the pandemic.",
    " Title: Michigan Legislature Poised to Pass Initiative Banning Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Michigan Legislature is set to vote on a measure that would prohibit abortion coverage from all health insurance plans, requiring women to purchase a separate policy to cover the procedure. The move, which has been criticized by reproductive health advocates, is expected to bypass a veto by Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who previously vetoed an identical ban last year.\n\nThe Michigan State Election Board certified on Monday that anti-choice group Right to Life of Michigan collected the necessary signatures to put the measure before lawmakers, a majority of whom support the ban. The ban contains no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.\n\nThe proposal has been met with strong opposition from reproductive health advocates, who argue that the measure amounts to a form of \"rape insurance.\" Meghan Groen, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, told RH Reality Check, \"You couldn\u2019t buy a rider once you were pregnant to have [an abortion] covered. It\u2019s not like, oh, I was raped and so now I\u2019ll buy this rider. Nobody is anticipating being a victim of crime.\"\n\nJessica Tramontana, communications director for Progress Michigan, said in a statement, \"It\u2019s unconscionable that Right to Life has launched a campaign against women\u2019s rights by finding a loophole in the law and skirting a signature from the governor.\" She added, \"Rape is not an accident.\"\n\nThe measure itself is also deceptive, as Michigan and federal law prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion care. However, anti-abortion activists have circulated the false idea that the Affordable Care Act will change the status quo. \"There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about what this actually does,\" Groen added.\n\nA majority of Michigan voters appear to oppose the measure, and identical proposals have been vetoed -- twice -- by Republican governors. However, advocates say the state Legislature has taken an extreme rightward turn and may push the measure through despite the lack of support.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Transformation on Gun Violence in Wake of Navy Yard Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Sunday called for a transformation in the United States' approach to gun violence, following the killing of 12 people at Washington's Navy Yard last week. Speaking at the Marine Barracks, just a few blocks from the Navy Yard, Obama said, \"It ought to be a shock to all of us, as a nation and as a people.\"\n\nThe president honored each victim, providing poignant details about their lives, such as Arthur Daniels' love for polishing his white Crown Victoria and John Johnson's last words to his wife, \"Good-bye, beautiful. I love you so much.\"\n\nObama expressed his frustration with the recurring nature of mass shootings, stating, \"What wears on us, what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today, is how this senseless violence that took place in the Navy Yard, echoes other recent tragedies.\"\n\nHe emphasized that the United States \"cannot accept\" such incidents as \"inevitable,\" but they should instead \"lead to some sort of transformation.\" The president has been deeply affected by these events, having had to grieve five times during his presidency, including the shootings in Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, and now the Washington Navy Yard.\n\nThe issue of gun violence has been a significant focus of Obama's second term, with a push for stronger gun laws following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012. However, these efforts have not resulted in any legislative changes, with lawmakers on Capitol Hill failing to pass any gun-related bills.\n\nIn response to last week's shooting at the Navy Yard, most gun-control advocates have resigned themselves to the fact that little legislative change will occur. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a supporter of gun control, stated on Tuesday, \"We do not have the votes. I'd like to get them, but we do not have them now.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association, in response to the shooting, suggested more armed guards at military installations. Obama addressed this issue, stating, \"I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions, including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis.\"\n\nObama also called for tighter gun laws, with Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray joining him in this appeal. \"Our country is drowning in a sea of guns,\" Gray said.\n\nIn his speech, Obama emphasized the need for change, stating, \"If we really want to honor these 12 men and women, if we really want to be a country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun, then we're going to have to change. We're going to have to change.\"",
    " Title: New Polls and Investigation Troubles for Hillary Clinton Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week was a challenging one for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, as new polls and an ongoing investigation into her email practices have raised concerns within her campaign.\n\nA Q-poll of voters in the swing states of Colorado, Virginia, and Iowa showed Clinton with unfavorable ratings on trust, empathy, and overall favorability. A new NBC/WSJ survey confirms Quinnipiac's findings, measuring Clinton's ratings approximately 20 points underwater in two early battleground states.\n\nChuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, described the numbers as \"dismal\" and \"troubling\" for the Clinton camp. In Iowa, Clinton's favorable vs. unfavorable rating is 37/56, and in New Hampshire, it's 37/57.\n\nOn Friday, news broke that two Inspectors General have requested a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Clinton's improper email server and usage. This development was described as \"incredibly significant\" by MSM tastemaker Mark Halperin, who cast it as a \"disaster\" for her campaign if a criminal probe moves forward.\n\nIn response to the New York Times' reporting, the Clinton camp has been parsing the IG referrals to the DOJ, with unclear implications as to whether the referrals were explicitly criminal in nature or if that determination has not yet been made. The investigation may focus on those responsible for Clinton's emails, not necessarily Clinton herself.\n\nIt's worth noting that Clinton ordered the (scandalously under-secured) server to be set up in the first place, misused it, and then ordered its contents culled prior to putting on a belated smoke-and-mirrors show of \"complying\" with records-keeping requirements.\n\nTwitter user Gabriel Malor provided a quick primer on the implications of Clinton's classified \"spillage\" problem. Aside from her lying about it, which is hardly unusual for her, any government employee with a 10% spillage rate would be fired immediately and have their life turned upside down looking for other spills.\n\nTwo facts, according to Wall Street Journal reporter Byron Tau, are central to the investigation: the matter of Clinton's improper email usage was referred to the FBI's counterintelligence division for investigation, and Clinton did use her private server and account(s) to share classified materials.\n\nIn times of distress, Clinton is known for deflecting, denying, and distracting. In this case, she has been ignoring the problems and playing the woman card, highlighting the male-dominated Democratic field and seemingly forgetting about Carly Fiorina's existence. Fiorina, a Republican candidate, appears to be gaining steam with the GOP electorate.",
    " Title: Tillerson, Rubio Clash Over Russia, Cuba, and Saudi Arabia at Senate Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of contentious exchanges during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) engaged in a heated debate, particularly over policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines.\n\nThe tense back-and-forths, which marked the second round of questioning for Tillerson, saw Rubio pressing the former ExxonMobil CEO on various policy issues. At the end of Rubio's second questioning period, Tillerson sought to allay any concerns the aggressive Rubio may have had.\n\n\"There seems to be some misunderstanding that I see the world through a different lens, and I do not,\" Tillerson said. \"... But I'm also clear-eyed and realistic about dealing with cultures.\"\n\nThe exchange followed a heated initial session during which Tillerson refused to specifically call Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal.\"\n\n\"I find it discouraging your ability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted,\" Rubio said.\n\nThis exchange mirrored later questions by Rubio, who tried to get Tillerson to categorize Saudi Arabia as a \"human rights violator\" and denounce the practices of controversial Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nTillerson also would not bite when Rubio, a former opponent of President-elect Donald Trump during the Republican presidential primary, tried to get Tillerson to say Putin murdered political foes.\n\nHowever, Tillerson took a noticeably harder line toward Putin and Russia than Trump has done during the transition period and prior to it.\n\n\"Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,\" Tillerson said during his opening statement. \"... Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia.\"\n\nTillerson called Russia an \"unfriendly adversary\" during later testimony, stopping short of saying the nation was an enemy of the U.S.\n\nRussia took center-stage during the early portion of the hearing for Tillerson. Senators grilled Tillerson amid swirling questions about alleged meddling in U.S. politics by the Kremlin and Tillerson's own business ties to Russia.\n\nTillerson said that Russia had no legal claim to Crimea -- \"that was a taking of territory that was not theirs\" -- and said the Obama administration should have provided Ukraine with help defending its borders.\n\n\"The absence of a very firm, forceful response to the taking of Crimea was judged by leadership in Russia as a weak response,\" Tillerson said.\n\nWhile Russia dominated the early proceedings, Tillerson also addressed other areas. He took aim at China's \"illegal\" building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and radical Islam, which he said posed \"a grave risk to the stability of nations and the well-being of their citizens.\"\n\nOn Syria, Tillerson said the U.S. currently had too many competing goals and needed to focus on defeating ISIS before a discussion could occur about who should lead the country. The Obama administration's dual priorities of ousting President Bashar al-Assad and eradicating ISIS were sometimes at odds with each other, Tillerson said.\n\nTillerson called ISIS an imminent threat but named cyber intrusions as the \"greatest and most complex threat\" facing the U.S. He also said the American government had \"stumbled\" under the Obama administration.\n\n\"If we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger,\" Tillerson said.\n\nOne moment of levity occurred when Sen. Tim Kaine asked Tillerson about ExxonMobil's climate change policies. Tillerson told Kaine that Kaine would need to ask current executives, to which Kaine asked if Tillerson lacked \"the knowledge to answer my question or are you refusing to answer my question?\"\n\nOn the topic of Trump's frequent use of Twitter, Tillerson said he would not \"tell the boss how to communicate with the American people. That's going to be his choice.\"\n\nTillerson testified a day after a contentious Senate session involving Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions. The audience at Tillerson's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing again appeared to be filled with protesters, including Code Pink activists who were dressed in Statue of Liberty garb, a man outfitted in a suit made of money, and some protesters suited up in T-Rex costumes \u2013 a play on Tillerson's name.\n\nOne early protester was ejected after she screamed \"I reject you!\" at Tillerson.",
    " Title: Sanders and Trump Discuss Possible Debate Ahead of California Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump have been discussing the possibility of a one-on-one debate before the California primary on June 7. The conversation was initiated by Jimmy Kimmel during his late-night talk show on Thursday, and Sanders expressed his enthusiasm for the prospective debate.\n\nDuring the show, Kimmel brought up the topic by asking Sanders if he had seen Wednesday's episode, where Kimmel posed a hypothetical debate question from Sanders' campaign to Trump. Trump jokingly responded, \"How much is he going to pay me?\"\n\nSanders responded, \"You saw the show last night? You saw what I did for you?\", referring to Kimmel's earlier efforts to facilitate a debate between the two candidates. Sanders continued, \"You made it possible for us to have a very interesting debate about two guys who look at the world very, very differently.\"\n\nTrump, in his response on Wednesday, had stated that the proceeds of such an event should go to charity, and he expressed his willingness to debate Sanders if a significant sum was donated to charity. Sanders, in a tweet on Thursday, wrote, \"Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign has been pushing for a debate with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton before the California primary. During a Revolt TV town hall on Thursday, Sanders himself brought up the topic, stating, \"I understand that yesterday on the Jimmy Kimmel show, which I'm going to be recording later today, Donald Trump has agreed to debate me. I look forward to that.\"\n\nLater in the day, Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, expressed hope that Trump would not \"chicken out\" after the two discussed the possibility of a one-on-one debate. Trump, however, has expressed his readiness to debate Sanders, stating that he would \"love to debate Bernie.\"\n\nTrump has made it clear that he wants to follow through with the debate, suggesting that it could raise funds for women's health issues and potentially generate high ratings. The Republican nominee has been in discussions with several networks about hosting the debate, and he has expressed his preference for a large arena setting.\n\nDespite Clinton's assertion that she will be the \"nominee for my party...That is already done,\" Sanders remains optimistic about his chances in the California primary. During Thursday's town hall, he stated, \"I kind of think that on June 7, people of California will have a message for Secretary Clinton.\"\n\nIn response to a question from Kimmel on Thursday night, Sanders commented on Clinton's statement that she is the presumptive nominee, saying, \"Unfortunately, the people of Indiana a couple of weeks ago, the people of West Virginia, the people of Oregon, who gave us a pretty good victory, do not quite agree with Secretary Clinton's assessment, and we split Kentucky.\"\n\nThe possibility of a debate between Sanders and Trump adds an unexpected twist to the 2016 presidential race, as both candidates continue to campaign ahead of the California primary.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Alleges \"Brazen\" Lawbreaking by Paul Manafort in Sentencing Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sentencing memo filed on Friday and made public on Saturday, prosecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller have accused Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, of \"brazenly\" violating the law. The memo, addressed to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, details Manafort's alleged crimes, which include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to obstruct justice, tax fraud, money laundering, and bank fraud, among others.\n\nManafort, who pleaded guilty in a Washington, D.C. court last year, is scheduled to be sentenced next month. In the memo, prosecutors argue that Manafort's criminal actions were \"bold,\" some of which were committed while under public scrutiny due to his role as the campaign chairman and later, while on bail from this Court.\n\nThe memo states, \"Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law\u2014 whether the laws proscribed garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud, or more esoteric laws that he nevertheless was intimately familiar with, such as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\"\n\nThe memo also highlights Manafort's alleged lies about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a person indicted by the special counsel and believed to have ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort is also accused of being untruthful in response to questions about his finances and his contacts with members of the Trump administration.\n\nManafort initially agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation, but the plea deal fell apart after Judge Jackson ruled earlier this month that he intentionally lied to Mueller's office, the FBI, and the grand jury in his case. This ruling meant that prosecutors were no longer bound by the plea deal.\n\nIn the District of Columbia, Manafort faces a maximum sentence of 10 years. In a separate case in Virginia, Manafort was found guilty on eight counts in a bank and tax fraud case. He faces up to 24 years in prison and tens of millions of dollars in possible fines for this conviction. Manafort's sentencing in the Virginia case is also scheduled for March.\n\nProsecutors have urged Judge Jackson to consider stacking Manafort's sentence in D.C. on top of his punishment in Virginia. Lawyers for Manafort are due to file their sentencing recommendation in D.C. on Monday.\n\nSeparately, reports by Bloomberg News and The New York Times on Friday suggest that authorities in New York are preparing charges against Manafort for violating state tax laws and other financial crimes.\n\nThe sentencing memo provides a detailed account of the prosecutors' perspective on Manafort's alleged crimes, but it is important to note that the court has yet to issue a final ruling on Manafort's sentencing.",
    " Title: President Trump Denies Requesting Comey to Halt Flynn Investigation, Amidst Flynn's Guilty Plea\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday morning, President Donald Trump denied ever asking former FBI Director James Comey to halt the investigation into Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Trump's statement comes in response to Comey's testimony before Congress in June, where he claimed that Trump pressured him during an Oval Office meeting in February to end the investigation into Flynn.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\"\n\nOn Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his conversations during the presidential transition with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions related to the Kremlin\u2019s election interference. He is the first person to have held a position in the Trump administration to be charged by the special counsel.\n\nIn an apparent shift on Saturday, Trump tweeted that he had to fire Flynn as national security adviser because the retired Army general lied to Vice President Pence and the FBI.\n\n\"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,\" Trump said in the tweet. \"It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful,\" he added. \"There was nothing to hide!\"\n\nHowever, two sources familiar with that tweet told The Washington Post on Saturday that John Dowd, Trump's personal lawyer, had crafted that tweet.\n\nAfter Flynn was fired, Trump said in February that he fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. \"I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple,\" Trump said.\n\nSome legal experts have speculated that if Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI and then asked Comey to drop the investigation, it could amount to obstruction of justice.\n\nSusan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted on Saturday, \"This is a pretty substantial confession to essential knowledge elements of an obstruction of justice charge.\"\n\nTrump told NBC News in May that he was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to fire Comey, who had been leading the FBI probe into Russia's election meddling.\n\nComey himself offered a cryptic message on Saturday shortly after Trump's tweet about Flynn's firing. The message read, \"All of the facts can be found in the public record. The FBI was never instructed to stop investigating Russia.\"",
    " Title: Trump Urges Federal Reserve for Further Rate Cuts, Citing Competitive Disadvantage Amid Global Economic Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further, stating that the central bank should \"lead\" rather than \"follow\" its global peers. The call came after the Fed announced a 50 basis point rate cut in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Fed's decision to lower interest rates to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% was made in an effort to provide additional support to the economy, which has been affected by the deadly virus. However, the move was met with market fluctuations, as the 10-year treasury yield dropped below 1% for the first time in history, and the market turned solidly red in afternoon trading.\n\nFed Chairman Jay Powell addressed the decision to cut rates during a news conference, stating that the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak remains highly uncertain and the situation is fluid. He emphasized that the Fed's move was intended to provide additional support to the economy, and that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the central bank for its decision, stating, \"I applaud the Fed on this move.\"\n\nTrump, who has often used stock market gains as a measure of his presidency, has been vocal about his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates. On Monday, he tweeted that the Fed is \"slow to act\" and that other countries are \"pumping money into their economies.\"\n\n\"The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We do not, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!\" Trump said in a tweet on Monday.\n\nThe Fed's move to lower rates came on the same day that the G-7 announced it would commit unspecified tools to help the global economy deal with the threat of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Wall Street was in the midst of another market sell-off. The market had its worst performance since the financial crisis last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 12%. It made up some of that ground on Monday, rising more than 1,200 points, for the biggest one-day point gain ever.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his disappointment in the Fed's decision, telling reporters that the Fed is \"following, not leading.\"\n\nThe call for further rate cuts comes as the Fed's benchmark rate stands in a range of 1% to 1.25%. The Fed's move to lower rates is part of a global trend, as central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.",

    " Title: Senate Report Alleges Christopher Steele Misled FBI in Obtaining FISA Warrant on Trump Campaign Aide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a Senate document released Tuesday evening has alleged that Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier, misled the FBI to secure a wiretap on a Trump campaign volunteer, Carter Page, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The disclosure further tarnishes an FBI already under fire from Republicans for concealing the dossier's Democratic financing.\n\nThe controversy revolves around the FISA warrant issued by a judge on Oct. 21, 2016, to monitor Carter Page. According to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Charles E. Grassley, the document refers to Christopher Steele and suggests that the FBI believed it had corroboration for the dossier when it did not.\n\nThe primary piece of evidence cited by the FBI in the FISA application was the discredited dossier, which accused the Trump campaign of colluding with the Kremlin, with Page being implicated. All parties involved have denied the allegations.\n\nThe Senate referral, signed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, reports that a Sept. 23, 2016, Yahoo News story reporting the same information was cited by the FBI to the judge as corroboration. However, the FBI did not have corroboration, only the dossier and a news story based on that very dossier.\n\nMoreover, the FBI attempted to protect Steele's credibility before the judge because it had not verified the dossier and used the former British spy's reputation as the selling point. To this day, the FBI has not verified his charges, some of which are salacious and quickly became the subject of public conversation when BuzzFeed printed the dossier.\n\nThe referral also states that the FBI continued to seek 90-day wiretap renewals based not on corroborating the dossier, but relying on Steele's reputation, even after he misled agents. The FBI planned to pay Steele, a partisan who hoped to sink the Trump campaign, to continue investigating President Trump. However, Steele was fired after giving an interview to Mother Jones magazine.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, reported Friday that the FBI never told the FISC judge that the dossier was financed by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. The application has a footnote that refers only to possible political backing.\n\nThe Grassley referral also disclosed for the first time that Steele wrote a memo on Oct. 19, showing that Steele received anti-Trump information from Clinton associates funneled through the State Department. Grassley is investigating the roles of Clinton operators Sid Blumenthal and Cody Shearer.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Vivek Murthy as U.S. Surgeon General, Ending 17-Month Vacancy\n\nAfter a year-long confirmation process, the Senate voted on Monday to confirm Dr. Vivek Murthy as the United States' new Surgeon General. The tally was 51-43, marking the end of a position that has been vacant since July 2013 during the Obama administration.\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy, an MD and MBA, practices and teaches at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He co-founded a clinical trials company, an HIV education organization, and Doctors for America. The National Rifle Association (NRA) was initially critical of Murthy due to his past tweets criticizing guns and the NRA, as well as Doctors for America's stance on gun control.\n\nHowever, the confirmation process was not solely due to these issues. The NRA also viewed Doctors for America as being against guns, with the group advocating for stricter gun control laws, including background checks, mandatory safety training, and banning certain semiautomatic weapons.\n\nDespite the opposition, Dr. Murthy's colleagues, including Dr. Chris Lillis, the Virginia state director for Doctors for America, have defended him. Lillis stated, \"Dr. Murthy's views that he expressed many years ago is in complete congruence with the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\"\n\nThe confirmation was also delayed due to the midterm elections, with many Democrats in red states stating they would join Republicans and vote no. However, with Congress now in a lame-duck session, Dr. Murthy received more support from Democrats. Additionally, conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz's unsuccessful gambit to stop President Obama's executive actions on immigration provided an opening for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to push through stalled nominations, including Dr. Murthy's.\n\nSince former Surgeon General Regina M. Benjamin left the post in the summer of 2013, it has been filled on an interim basis by Rear Admiral Boris D. Lushniak. President Obama released a statement on Dr. Murthy's confirmation, stating, \"I applaud the Senate for confirming Vivek Murthy to be our country's next Surgeon General... Vivek will help us build on the progress we've made combatting Ebola, both in our country and at its source.\"",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Disapprove of Senate GOP's Health Care Bill, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by NPR, PBS NewsHour, and Marist Institute for Public Opinion has revealed that a significant majority of Americans disapprove of the Senate Republican's health care bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act.\n\nThe survey found that only 17% of respondents approve of the Senate's health care plan, while 55% disapprove. About a quarter of those surveyed said they had not heard enough about the proposal to form an opinion.\n\nThe Senate GOP's decision to delay a vote on the legislation until after the July Fourth recess comes as defections within the Republican caucus over the bill mount.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis on Monday, which found that if the bill were enacted, 22 million fewer people would have health insurance over the next decade due, in part, to the bill's rollback of Medicaid expansion.\n\nLee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, stated, \"With numbers like these, it's not surprising the Republican leadership in Congress is having a difficult time building consensus.\"\n\nWhile Democratic opposition to the bill is high, GOP support for the Senate GOP's plan is very soft. Twenty-one percent of Republicans oppose the bill, and just 35% support it. Sixty-eight percent of independents also oppose the proposed legislation.\n\nThe poll also found that while many Americans want changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, they want it to be more far-reaching. A 46% plurality said they want to see the ACA do more, while just 7% want it to do less. Keeping the ACA and having it do less is essentially what GOP congressional plans are doing.\n\nOnly 17% want the 2010 bill left intact and unchanged, while a quarter of Americans want it repealed completely\u2014including just over half of Republicans.\n\nIf Congress does not go through with a repeal of the ACA, 37% of Americans said they would blame Republicans in Congress, while 23% would blame Democrats, and 15% would blame President Trump.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump would not bear the brunt of the blame if Congress is unable to repeal and replace Obamacare. Just 6% would blame him, and half said they would blame congressional Democrats. Another 20% said they would blame GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,205 adults from June 21-25, 2017, contacted by live interviewers using a mix of landline and mobile numbers. The margin of error is \u00b1 2.8 percentage points. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a \u00b1 3.1 percentage points margin of error. Questions relating to how congressional Republicans are handling the issue of health care, the plan proposed by Senate Republicans, and whom should be blamed if Congress does not repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were fielded from June 22-25, 2017, with 939 adults and 769 registered voters. The margin of error is +/- 3.2 percentage points and +/- 3.5 percentage points, respectively.",
    " Title: Navigating the Populist Challenge: Strategies for Liberals and Technocrats in the Face of Rising Populism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, tensions between populist and technocratic ideologies have come to the forefront, with the divide not strictly adhering to traditional conservative and liberal lines. This article explores four strategies that liberals and technocrats can employ to confront the populist challenge.\n\nPassive Resistance:\nOne approach is to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, allowing populism to reveal its inherent flaws and ultimately fall on its own. The argument is that the stigmatization of populist ideas by technocratic liberalism has led to the empowerment of marginal, low-status individuals who may prove incompetent in office. The hope is that the populist movement's failures will serve as a lesson, inoculating the system and discouraging future attempts at populist governance.\n\nTriangulation:\nAnother strategy is triangulation, which involves acknowledging and addressing some of the populists' concerns to preserve democracy. This approach involves compromising on certain issues, such as accepting trade barriers as the result of democratic process or slowing down the rate of immigration to maintain a core national culture. The goal is to maintain a tolerant society while addressing the concerns of the populist movement.\n\nBrinksmanship:\nThe third strategy is brinksmanship, which involves embracing and neutralizing the worst aspects of populism to defeat it. This approach is based on the belief that unchecked populism and nationalism could lead to the destruction of democracy, freedom of expression, and the creation of an irrational fear of foreigners. Proponents of this strategy argue that, in extreme cases, it may be necessary to engage in actions that are typically associated with populism, such as ignoring democratic verdicts or delegitimizing elections, in order to preserve liberal values.\n\nAssimilation:\nThe final strategy is assimilation, which involves absorbing the populist movement into the existing political structure. This approach recognizes that populism can lead to periods of economic growth and increased popularity, as seen in Poland. The goal is to co-opt the populist movement and use its energy to further liberal ideals, while minimizing the negative consequences of populist policies.\n\nEach strategy carries its own risks, and the applicability of each approach varies depending on the specific circumstances. The ongoing Brexit saga in the United Kingdom serves as an example of a populist movement that may be falling on its face, while being led by a prime minister who campaigned for remaining in the European Union.\n\nIn conclusion, the strategies for confronting the populist challenge are varied, and the most effective approach may depend on the specific circumstances and the willingness of leaders to engage in compromise or confrontation. The future of Western societies will likely be shaped by the choices made in the coming years, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Divergent Views: Trump and Pence on Trade, Russia, Iraq, and Muslims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, has demonstrated a stark contrast in views on trade, Russia, Iraq, and Muslims compared to the billionaire businessman. Throughout his 16-year political career, the 57-year-old Indiana governor has adhered to traditionally muscular Republican policies on foreign affairs.\n\nTrump, however, has taken a more isolationist approach and placed less emphasis on foreign issues. The issues that he has put at the center of his campaign are largely the ones he and his running mate disagree on.\n\nOne of the most significant areas of disagreement is the Iraq intervention. Trump has made his opposition to the Iraq intervention a major theme, criticizing Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her 2002 vote backing the war when she was in the Senate. In contrast, Pence, near the beginning of his 12-year tenure in the U.S. House, voted for the resolution authorizing the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nPence, who chaired the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, was also a prominent backer of the 2007 \"surge\" strategy, sending more U.S. troops to the faltering effort in Iraq. He defended the original decision to invade despite the absence of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nOn Russia, Pence has taken a harder line than Trump, whose authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has praised. Trump has expressed a desire for better relations with Russia, while Pence has criticized Putin's Russia for its actions in Ukraine and Europe.\n\nAnother contentious issue is global trade. Trump has frequently called NAFTA, which regulates trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, \"a disaster.\" Pence, in contrast, has praised the role of global trade and slammed protectionism. He has also backed free trade deals with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea while in Congress.\n\nPerhaps most problematic for Trump, Pence has been a strong proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal involving 12 countries pushed by the Obama administration. While Trump has criticized the deal, Pence has endorsed it in the past.\n\nHowever, the Indiana governor has found common ground with Trump on some national security issues, especially when it comes to criticizing President Barack Obama. Like Trump, Pence has slammed Obama for reductions in the size of the American military and has echoed Trump's critique of the President's preferred terminology for terrorist groups.\n\nBoth Pence and Trump have also been avid backers of the Middle Eastern ally, Israel. They have both criticized the Iran nuclear deal and have expressed support for Israel. However, last winter, Trump was castigated by many Republicans for declining to promise to keep Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, a stance that Pence has not taken.",
    " Title: Romney's Transition Team Plots Modest, Pragmatic Agenda for Potential Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's transition team, known as the \"Readiness Project,\" is gearing up for a possible Romney presidency, focusing on a series of swift, yet measured actions to improve the economy while avoiding over-promising due to the narrow Republican majority in Congress.\n\nThe team's strategy is particularly evident in the area of health reform, where Romney's promise to \"repeal Obamacare\" may face limitations, even with a Republican Senate. According to a team official, under a Democratic Senate, they would aim to make incremental changes through regulatory measures.\n\nRomney's approach is being described as pragmatic, with a focus on problem-solving, particularly in economic matters. Unlike George W. Bush's administration in 2001, Romney's presidency is expected to be centered on removing barriers to economic growth and providing certainty to businesses regarding taxes and regulations.\n\nThe team's legislative agenda, dubbed a \"200-day plan,\" is a more modest approach than the 100-day plans of past presidents, due to the current political climate. The aides and advisers have opted for confidentiality to avoid appearing presumptuous and to avoid the perception of measuring the drapes.\n\nImmigration reform, a Romney promise from the second presidential debate, has caused some roll-eyes from aides, indicating that they may not prioritize it as heavily as initially suggested. However, conservatives do expect Romney to make a few changes by executive decree in the first 48 hours of his presidency, including re-implementing the \"Mexico City policy\" and issuing waivers to states that do not wish to participate in elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for a Romney administration, according to the aides, will be balancing the needs of conservative lawmakers while addressing the nation's fiscal emergency. This urgent task may initially alienate the conservative, revenue-resistant wing of House Republicans, despite their leaders recognizing the necessity of raising revenues.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign Aims for $100 Million in Funding 17 Months Before Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that mirrors the high-priced real estate market in Manhattan, Republican Jeb Bush's presidential campaign is aiming to raise $100 million by June 1, 2015. This ambitious fundraising target is set for Right to Rise SuperPAC, a committee established to support Bush's bid for the White House.\n\nMuch of this funding has been gathered through private dinners with millionaires and billionaires since January. The former governor of Florida has portrayed this as standard political practice, stating, \"The campaign finance laws are what they are, and the campaigns are going to have to play within those rules.\"\n\nHowever, Sheila Krumholz, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, questions the interpretation of these rules. \"Gov. Bush says they'll play within the rules\u2014great,\" she says. \"But the rules, as they're currently interpreted, by his and other campaigns, have been practically rendered meaningless. This is a radical shift in thinking about what campaigns can and can't do.\"\n\nOne factor enabling this shift is that neither Bush nor many other potential White House contenders have officially declared their candidacy. This legal loophole allows them to engage in heavy-duty fundraising for Right to Rise SuperPAC, as an official candidate would be limited to soliciting $2,700 per donor, the same as the maximum contribution to a candidate's official presidential campaign committee for the primary season.\n\nAnother significant development is the possibility that some campaigns, including Bush's, might outsource the expensive task of running TV advertising to a designated superPAC. While superPACs are not allowed to coordinate messages with the candidate's campaign committee, speculation suggests that some campaigns may delegate the entire advertising operation to a superPAC.\n\nDan Backer, a conservative campaign finance lawyer, downplays the role of superPACs, stating, \"They probably have relationships with the candidates that they're ultimately going to support. But they are distinct legal entities\u2014and very intentionally so.\"\n\nMichael Malbin, director of the Campaign Finance Institute, expresses concern about the growing closeness between donors, candidates, and elected officials. He predicts that, as contribution limits and other rules weaken, situations will arise where candidates will start soliciting and extorting large amounts of money.\n\nMalbin compares this trend to three previous eras when presidential candidates were able to solicit unlimited campaign cash: the 1890s and 1900s, when advisers to presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt pressured corporations to give; the early 1970s, when President Richard Nixon and aides traded official decisions for political funds; and the \"soft money\" period of the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton and senators of both parties made Washington a partner to corporations and billionaires.\n\nEach era ended with the enactment of new laws regulating political money. As the 2016 presidential race approaches, the question remains whether the current trend will follow a similar pattern or mark a more permanent shift in campaign finance.",
    " Title: House Votes to Fund Government Through Mid-December, Conditional on Defunding ObamaCare; Senate Showdown Looms\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to keep the government open through mid-December, but only if Congress strips funding from the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. The current funding for the government is set to expire at the end of the month, and lawmakers must approve the stopgap bill to keep Washington operating.\n\nThe GOP measure would fund the government through Dec. 15 at current funding levels. The vote sets the stage for a showdown next week in the Democratic-led Senate, where the chances of the measure surviving a vote are slim. One Senate Democrat has already announced the bill as dead on arrival and called Friday's vote a \"waste of time.\"\n\nRepublicans are \"postponing for a few days the inevitable choice they must face: pass a clean bill to fund the government, or force a shutdown,\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a statement following the vote. \"The Senate will not pass any bill that defunds or delays Obamacare.\"\n\nAt a noon rally on Capitol Hill, House Speaker John Boehner said the House vote speaks to the popularity of the Affordable Care Act. \"You've got businesses all over the country who are not hiring because of the impact of this law,\" he said. \"You've got other businesses who are reducing the hours for their employees because of this law.\"\n\nThe House measure would replace ObamaCare with a plan that expands tax breaks for Americans who buy their own insurance, setting the stage for a showdown with Senate Democrats that could push the government toward a partial shutdown at the end of the month. More than 140 congressional Republicans signed on to the bill to keep the government running at existing funding levels and delay the health care law.\n\nDemocrats have vowed to oppose that bill, warning the strategy risks a government shutdown, with funding set to expire by Oct. 1. Under the proposal, Americans who purchase coverage through state-run exchanges can claim a $7,500 deduction against their income and payroll taxes, regardless of the cost of the insurance. Families could deduct $20,000. The plan also increases government funding for high-risk pools.\n\nInternal divisions have plagued Republicans this year as they struggle to produce alternatives to the Obama plan. Legislation backed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., to increase funding for high-risk pools was pulled without a vote after some conservatives objected to improving ObamaCare at a time when they want to repeal it.\n\nObama and Democrats frequently criticize Republicans for focusing so much attention on repeal efforts without coming up with an alternative. The legislation includes a number of proposals that Republicans long have backed to expand access and hold down the cost of health care, including features that permit companies to sell policies across state lines and that let small businesses join together to seek better rates from insurers. In addition, awards for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and similar noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases would be capped at $250,000, unless a state had a higher cap.",
    " Title: Facebook Introduces Ban on Deepfakes, but Critics Question Effectiveness and Timing\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook, the social media giant, announced on Monday that it will ban certain types of deepfakes - videos manipulated to make it appear as though individuals are doing or saying things they did not. This policy marks Facebook's first steps towards regulating deepfakes, but it comes with caveats.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, Facebook Vice President Monika Bickert stated that the ban will not apply to \"parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words.\" Facebook's moderators will remove videos edited through artificial intelligence or machine learning \"in ways that are not apparent to an average person and would likely mislead\" viewers. Bickert did not elaborate on how the company would assess an average person's understanding of altered videos.\n\nThe new policy has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it would not have prevented the most well-known recent example of an altered video to go viral. In May, a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi edited to make it seem as though she were slurring her words while speaking at a public event was viewed millions of times.\n\nRepresentative Jennifer Wexton criticized Facebook's policy, stating on Twitter, \"Call it what you want\u2014deepfake or cheapfake\u2014it\u2019s still disinformation and @ Facebook needs to do more to stop it from spreading.\" Wexton had previously pressed Mark Zuckerberg on his lack of a plan to combat deepfakes and his refusal to remove a deceptively edited video of Speaker Pelosi.\n\nJason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents digital publishers, expressed concern about the speed with which viral videos spread and the role Facebook's algorithm plays in this. \"We're entirely at risk here in letting Facebook turn this into a censorship debate while ignoring the fact these videos only receive their velocity and reach due to Facebook's algorithm and recommendations not because they're simply allowed to exist,\" Kint said.\n\nKint also criticized the timing of Facebook's announcement, noting that Bickert is scheduled to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Wednesday. \"I wish Facebook would proactively push out new policies in order to improve their product for the public, not just 48 hours before hearings or (when) press reports on them,\" Kint said.\n\nSaniat Sohrawardi, a researcher who studies deepfakes and methods used to identify them, echoed Kint's concern about the speed with which viral videos move. \"There are not any very reliable ways to detect the fakes yet, at least none published that would be good for open-world detection,\" Sohrawardi said. Sohrawardi also noted that when technology to effectively detect deepfakes is created, the fight against them will have only just begun. \"If we create a good enough detector and it gets popular enough that everybody knows about it, including the attackers, they will theoretically be able to create better fakes using that machine learning,\" said Sohrawardi.",
    " Title: Can the Government Quarantine Individuals Against Their Will in the U.S.: A Constitutional Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of a public health crisis, the question of whether the government in America can enforce quarantines against individuals' will has emerged as a pressing issue. This question necessitates a dual analysis, focusing on the powers of both the federal government and the states.\n\nAs local and regional governments derive their powers from the states in which they are located, the analysis of state powers is equally relevant. The fundamental principle that underlies this discussion is the inherent value of personal liberty, a right that predates government and is rooted in our humanity.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, as well as various amendments in the Bill of Rights, unequivocally reflects the recognition that our rights\u2014to think, speak, publish, worship, defend ourselves, travel, own property, and be left alone\u2014are natural to our humanity. These rights preexist the government, their source being our humanity, not the government itself. The government's primary purpose, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, is to protect these rights.\n\nWhile the courts have interpreted the Constitution to contain lamentable exceptions, the framers and ratifiers likely accepted the non-aggression principle, articulated in the modern era by the late Professor Murray Rothbard, which declares that all aggression against persons and property, even by government, is immoral.\n\nIn the case of the federal government, it is a government of limited, delegated powers. Despite 230 years of legislation and litigation, the federal government's powers have expanded beyond the confines of the Constitution, often at the expense of personal liberty and the states. The states formed the federal government, not the other way around.\n\nToday, the federal government maintains its power by bribing the states with cash grants, the rich with bailouts, the middle class with tax breaks, and the poor with transfer payments. Notwithstanding all this, the courts continue to recognize the concept of personal liberty in a free society.\n\nThe question of whether the government\u2014state or federal\u2014can confine individuals against their will in a public health crisis is complex. The short answer is yes, but the Constitution requires procedural due process.\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment, if any government\u2014state or federal\u2014wants to impair the life, liberty, or property of any person, it must follow due process. The substantive component asks if the impairment of liberty is proper to the government that seeks the impairment, and the procedural component asks if the impairment has come about fairly.\n\nIn a public health crisis, the states and federal government can confine a person who is actively contagious and will infect others imminently. However, it must present evidence of both at a trial at which it bears the burden of proof. While the non-aggression principle permits offensive aggression in self-defense when an attack is imminent and certain, that is a high standard for the government to meet, as it should be.\n\nFreedom\u2014even the freedom of a madman or a dangerously sick and contagious person\u2014is the default position. Infringing upon it without procedural due process is always constitutionally impermissible. The Constitution was not written for the government to right every wrong. We know that government itself causes most wrongs\u2014the theft of property by taxation, the impairment of economic liberty by regulation, the slaughter of innocents by war, the infringement of expressive liberties by majority vote. Yet, the Constitution still mandates an exacting due process for all whom the government would restrain. That means a trial before any quarantine, no matter the public danger, and a fair trial, not one animated by mass hysteria or government-generated fear.",
    " Title: CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman Resigns, Alleges Prioritization of Financial Companies Over Consumers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) student loan ombudsman, Seth Frotman, has resigned, citing the agency's leadership's alleged prioritization of powerful financial companies over consumers, according to a report by National Public Radio (NPR) on Monday.\n\nIn his official resignation letter, Frotman stated that the leadership at the CFPB has \"turned its back on young people and their financial futures.\" The letter further read, \"Unfortunately, under your leadership, the Bureau has abandoned the very consumers it is tasked by Congress with protecting,\" according to NPR. \"Instead, you have used the Bureau to serve the wishes of the most powerful financial companies in America.\"\n\nThe letter was reportedly addressed to Mick Mulvaney, the CFPB's acting director. Frotman had served as the student loan ombudsman for the last three years, NPR reported. In his role, Frotman led the agency's Office for Students and Young Consumers, where he evaluated thousands of complaints from student borrowers and reviewed questionable practices from private lenders, loan services, and debt collectors.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tweeted that the administration's actions were \"shameful.\" He said, \"The administration has forced another cop from the beat when it comes to protecting students from predatory #4profit colleges, loan servicers, and repayment scams. It is shameful.\"\n\nThe CFPB has reviewed more than 60,000 student loan complaints and returned more than $750 million to aggrieved borrowers since 2011, according to NPR. However, the office has changed under the Trump administration. For example, in August 2017, the Department of Education announced it would no longer share information with the CFPB regarding its review of federal student loans, NPR reported.\n\n\"The Bureau's current leadership folded to political pressure... and failed borrowers who depend on independent oversight to halt bad practices,\" Frotman wrote in his letter, according to NPR.\n\nFrotman's resignation comes as the Department of Education continues to propose changes regarding aid meant for defrauded students. In December 2017, the Department of Education announced new rules for providing aid to students who said they were defrauded by their colleges. The new system would limit some student loan refunds by tying it to their income. The New York Times reported in May that the Education Department had largely dismantled a team charged with investigating abuses by for-profit colleges.",
    " Title: Early Voting Shifts Election Rhythms in Iowa and Across the Nation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Des Moines, Iowa, voters began casting their ballots on Thursday, marking the start of early voting in the state. This trend, which has gained momentum in 32 states and the District of Columbia, is reshaping the traditional electoral process, with Election Day becoming Election Month for as much as 40 percent of the electorate this year.\n\nThe Obama campaign, which has built its re-election strategy around early voting, is capitalizing on this shift. In a close election, the campaign aims to accrue more votes over the next 40 days, rather than focusing solely on winning more votes on Election Day.\n\nThe rise of early voting has opened a new front in efforts to maximize turnout and find voters through exhaustive micro-targeting. In Des Moines, Democrats and Republicans have requested temporary voting sites at locations such as La Tapatia Tienda Mexicana, Johnston Evangelical Free Church, libraries, grocery stores, and community centers.\n\nWhile some people will vote in person, more will do so by mail. In Iowa, Democrats have a significant edge over Republicans in the numbers of absentee ballots requested statewide, but Republicans expect the numbers to level out over the next five weeks.\n\nThe proportion of people nationwide casting early ballots has increased from 23 percent in 2004 to 31 percent in 2008, according to Michael McDonald, who studies early voting at George Mason University. This year, party strategists estimate that up to 40 percent of voters will cast ballots before Nov. 6, but the proportion is far higher in many battleground states such as Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada, where advisers to both campaigns say as many as 70 percent of ballots will be cast before Nov. 6.\n\nIn Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa, the campaigns estimate at least 30 percent of people will vote early. Virginia and New Hampshire are the only battleground states without widespread, no-excuse early voting.\n\nRepublican officials in several states acknowledge that the Obama campaign may start with a slight advantage in early voting due to Democrats' greater familiarity with early voting. To level the playing field, the Republican National Committee is overseeing early-voting efforts as part of its national field program, and the Republican secretary of state in Ohio sent absentee ballot requests to every registered voter in the state.\n\nAs the early voting period unfolds, both campaigns will continue to engage in micro-targeting and voter outreach to maximize turnout. The outcome of the election will depend on which campaign is more successful in executing their early voting strategies.",
    " Title: Christie Endorses Trump, Shifts Allegiance After Criticizing Him in Past\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, following a contentious relationship between the two in the past. The announcement was made in a joint press conference in Texas on Friday, a day after Trump's fierce debate with Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump, in his characteristic casual manner, downplayed the significance of endorsements, stating, \"I could have had quite a few good ones. This was an endorsement that really meant a lot. Chris is an outstanding man with an outstanding family.\"\n\nChristie, who has been criticized for his role in the rise of Atlantic City's crime rate and the failure of his plan to revitalize the casino city, acknowledged that he and Trump had decided on the endorsement and its timing in a meeting on Thursday. However, he had been contemplating his involvement in the race after a disappointing performance in the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"I concluded, along with Mary Pat and the children, to support the person we thought to provide the best leadership for America and the person who could best make sure that Hillary Clinton never gets within 10 miles of the White House,\" Christie said, exchanging the podium with Trump in a tag-team-like manner reminiscent of WWE wrestlers.\n\nDespite his past criticisms of Trump, including comparing his campaign to that of Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann in August, and stating that Trump's temperament and experience were not suited for the presidency, Christie emphasized the loyalty he and Trump share, having been friends for many years.\n\nThe endorsement comes after Christie sold off his list of donor emails and supporters to Marco Rubio on Friday morning, just two weeks after he labeled Rubio as a \"robot\" in a debate before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThe endorsement could potentially impact the ongoing Republican primary race, as both Trump and Christie share a mutual disdain for Marco Rubio, who momentarily captured the media spotlight after Thursday's debate.\n\nWhen asked about Rubio's attacks on Trump during the debate, Christie responded, \"Desperate people do desperate things.\" He further urged voters to turn away from the \"amateur acts from Washington, D.C.\" and towards a strong leader, implying Trump as the candidate who fits this description.\n\nThe endorsement marks a significant shift in the political landscape, as both Christie and Trump, known for their aggressive and unconventional styles, join forces in their shared opposition to Marco Rubio.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Political Homogeneity Among Elite College Faculty, Raises Concerns Over Indoctrination and Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent study titled \"Homogeneous: The Political Affiliations of Elite Liberal Arts College Faculty,\" Brooklyn College professor Mitchell Langbert has shed light on the political leanings of faculty members at top-ranked liberal arts colleges in the United States. The study, published by Academic Questions, an organization fighting leftist propaganda in academia, reveals a significant imbalance in political affiliations among faculty members.\n\nAccording to the study, 39 percent of the 51 colleges examined have no registered Republicans on their faculties. In academic departments, 78 percent have no Republican members or so few as to make no difference.\n\nThe study breaks down the faculty Democrat-to-Republican ratio by academic department, with engineering departments having 1.6 Democrats for every Republican, chemistry and economics departments having about 5.5 Democrats for every Republican, and anthropology departments having a ratio of 133-to-1. Communications departments have a ratio of 108-to-0.\n\nLangbert notes that he could not find a single Republican with an exclusive appointment to fields like gender studies, Africana studies, and peace studies.\n\nThe study also highlights the Democrat-to-Republican faculty ratios at some of the most elite colleges. At Williams College, the ratio is 132-to-1, at Amherst College it's 34-to-1, at Wellesley it's 136-to-1, at Swarthmore it's 120-to-1, and at Claremont McKenna it's 4-to-1. Only two colleges of the top 66 on U.S. News & World Report's 2017 list have a modicum of equality in numbers between Democratic and Republican faculty members. They are the U.S. Military Academy, aka West Point, with a Democrat-to-Republican ratio of 1.3-to-1, and the U.S. Naval Academy, whose ratio is 2.3-to-1.\n\nThe study raises concerns over the potential for indoctrination and bias in college research and academic policy, as well as the use of class time to indoctrinate students with professors' views. The study suggests that this political homogeneity is embedded in the college culture and is in stark contrast to the political leanings of the nation, where most Americans identify as conservative, according to Pew Research Center surveys.\n\nThe study comes in the wake of recent incidents of controversial behavior by professors and students at various colleges, including California State University, Fresno professor Randa Jarrar's tweets about the late Barbara Bush, and Brookdale Community College professor Howard Finkelstein's heated exchange with a conservative student. At the City University of New York School of Law, students shouted down guest lecturer Josh Blackman for 10 minutes before he could continue his remarks, and at Duke University, students commandeered the stage and shouted demands during a speech by President Vincent Price.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate and concern among educators, policymakers, and parents, with some arguing that the political leanings of faculty members should not impact the quality of education or the impartiality of research. Others argue that the political homogeneity in academia is a reflection of a broader cultural and societal shift towards the left, and that it is the responsibility of colleges and universities to foster open and diverse perspectives.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Health Care Law: A Political Victory for Obama, a Campaign Issue for Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld President Obama's signature health care law, but defined the individual mandate as a tax. This ruling provides a political victory for President Obama as he campaigns for re-election, validating his efforts to pass the legislation in 2009 amidst the economic downturn.\n\nThe ruling allows President Obama to celebrate the law's benefits during his re-election campaign, a victory that Democrats have been quick to claim, despite attempts by the president and some others to downplay the political implications.\n\nRep. Steve Israel, New York Democrat and chairman of the House Democrats' campaign committee, said the ruling \"isn't a political victory for Democrats; it's a victory for America's middle class and seniors, and now House Republicans need to drop their partisan obstruction and move on.\"\n\nHowever, the ruling also provides Republicans with a sharper campaign issue, as the law's individual mandate is now defined as a tax. The high court's ruling leaves in place 21 tax increases in the health care law, costing more than $675 billion over the next 10 years, according to the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe ruling has been met with criticism from Republicans, who argue that it violates President Obama's pledge to avoid tax hikes on low- and middle-income taxpayers. The House Ways and Means Committee stated that 12 tax hikes in the law would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, including a \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost insurance plans, a tax on insurance providers, and an excise tax on medical-device manufacturers.\n\nThe Romney campaign has pledged to repeal the health care law if he is elected, and the two candidates engaged in dueling news conferences within two hours of the high court's decision. The Republican trumped the president by giving his televised statement nearly a half-hour before the president spoke at the White House.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision was a significant win for President Obama, who has been fond of saying that middle-class families will not see their taxes rise \"a single dime\" under his leadership. If the justices had overturned the law or key portions of it, Mr. Obama would have been portrayed as having wasted his term on a demonstrably failed policy.\n\nThe ruling has emboldened Democratic strategists, who argue that the Supreme Court under conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has aided Mr. Obama's agenda. The Romney campaign has reported raising about $1 million in the first three hours after the decision was announced, while the Obama campaign has also seen an increase in fundraising efforts.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court's ruling on the health care law has provided a political victory for President Obama, but also a sharper campaign issue for Republicans as they continue to criticize the law's tax implications and argue for its repeal.",
    " Title: CBO Warns of Looming Fiscal Crisis: Federal Debt to Double by 2037, Reach 200% of GDP\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a grim assessment of the U.S. government's budget challenges, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has warned that the federal debt will double by the middle of the next decade and reach more than twice the size of the entire U.S. economy by 2037, unless Congress takes action on taxes and spending. The CBO's report, released Tuesday, paints the country's worst fiscal picture since the brief period during World War II, when spending surged to fund the military campaign but returned to normal soon after the war ended.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan agency's analysts, the federal government has been recording the largest budget deficits since 1945, both in dollar terms and as a share of the economy. Consequently, the amount of federal debt held by the public has surged. The CBO's report states that public debt will be equal to 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of this fiscal year, up from 40 percent at the end of 2008. By 2037, the debt is projected to reach more than 200 percent of GDP.\n\nThe CBO attributes the growing debt to an aging population that requires higher spending on healthcare, and to higher interest payments on the debt. The report states that if no action is taken, the debt will have a decidedly negative impact on the economy, with a 4.4 percent lower GDP in 2027 and 13.4 percent lower in 2037.\n\nThe CBO's report also provides some interesting snapshots about how both the budget and the economy will change. Among the assumptions is that the U.S. population will reach 389 million in 2037 and top 500 million in 2087, with the population skewing ever older. Older workers tend to work fewer hours, meaning that by 2087, the average number of hours worked per employee in the workforce will be about 2 percent less than in 2022.\n\nThe CBO also predicts that the growth in the labor force will slow, keeping economic growth to an average of 2.2 percent over the long term. However, the interest rate on debt will be higher, at an average of 2.7 percent, a reversal from recent years when economic growth and interest rates were about the same.\n\nThe CBO's report gives some interesting insights into the potential consequences of the country's fiscal trajectory. However, it remains to be seen whether Congress will take action to address the looming fiscal crisis. The report states that if Congress delays all of the tax increases and spending cuts, the debt will explode, but if it allows the tax increases and spending cuts to take effect, the debt will begin to shrink almost immediately. The report serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for bipartisan cooperation to address the country's long-term budget challenges.",
    " Title: The Political Implications of Obamacare: A Shift in Strategy and Potential Consequences for the GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has been a contentious issue in American politics since its inception in 2010. While the economic implications of the costly national health care plan have been widely debated, the political implications are now gaining prominence.\n\nInitially, health care reform was not seen as a political strategy, with terms such as \"accessibility\" and \"affordability\" used to demonstrate commitment to quality health care for all Americans. However, with the signing of the PPACA into law on March 23, 2010, and its subsequent evolution into Obamacare, the political landscape shifted dramatically.\n\nThe Democratic position, as embodied by the PPACA, emphasized not only \"accessibility\" and \"affordability,\" but also \"protection\" of Americans, Medicare, and Medicaid, and \"fairness\" to address inequalities in the system. Various demographic groups, including seniors, minorities, liberals, and women, were initially targeted. Over time, the underlying political message was sold to a broader audience.\n\nHowever, critics argue that Obamacare will reportedly cost taxpayers $1 trillion and will be a financial burden for future generations. It will increase government influence over health care, reduce consumer choice, and potentially lead to the loss of an estimated 80,000 jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Moreover, the extensive phase-in period between 2014 and 2020 will create confusion, and businesses will struggle under the weight of the 2,700-page document.\n\nRepublican opposition to Obamacare has had some political effect, with a Reuters-Ipsos poll in June 2012 showing 56 percent of Americans surveyed were against it. However, the general consensus was that Obamacare wouldn't adequately fix health care, and that real reform was necessary.\n\nIn a surprising move, 19 Republican governors in mostly red states have decided to let the federal government implement Obamacare rather than setting up their own exchanges. This strategy could potentially empower the federal government at the expense of the states and could be used as a political tactic to blame the White House for forcing the issue.\n\nThis strategy has raised questions about the future of the GOP, with potential consequences for both the party and the American people. Red- and blue-state Republicans must continue to oppose Obamacare vigorously and point out the costs to taxpayers and long-lasting economic damage at every turn. Once Obamacare is in place, it will be incredibly difficult to ever remove it, effectively ending the GOP's political battle to protect health care.",
    " Title: Uninsured Population in the US Remains Significant Despite ACA, New Book and Lancet Series Highlight Health Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed American Health Care Act, the focus has shifted back to the real effects of health reform in the United States. A new book, \"An American Sickness,\" by journalist Elisabeth Rosenthal, critiques the transformation of the American healthcare system from a patient care system to a multitrillion-dollar business.\n\nOne of the major issues highlighted in the book is the persistence of an uninsured population in the US that is nearly as large as the population of Canada. According to Rosenthal, the uninsured population in the US has decreased since 2013, but there are still nearly 30 million people living without health insurance.\n\nThe size of the uninsured group is well-known, but less clear is what this group looks like. A new series in the Lancet on health inequality provides a detailed picture. People who go without insurance in America are not refusing coverage for ideological reasons; they simply cannot afford to pay.\n\nMost uninsured Americans have yearly incomes that are near or below the poverty line ($11,770 for an individual in 2016). The Lancet reports that among non-elderly adults, 7.6% of the non-poor were uninsured in 2015, compared with 25.2% of the poor and 24.1% of the near-poor. In other words, the poor and near-poor were more than three times more likely to be uninsured than their higher-income counterparts.\n\nThe other group that is less likely to be insured are people of color, according to the Lancet. In 2015, the uninsurance rate among adults aged 18-64 years remained far higher for Hispanics (27.7%) and non-Hispanic blacks (14.4%) than for non-Hispanic whites (8.7%).\n\nThe disparities in access to care are wider in the US than in other developed countries. Before the 2010 passage of the ACA, which progressively expanded health insurance coverage, 39% of Americans with below-average income reported not seeing a doctor for a medical problem because of cost, compared with 7% of low-income Canadians and 1% of those in the UK.\n\nThe Lancet researchers do not think that the kind of market-based reforms the GOP is pushing are the solution to the problem. Instead, they are siding with a certain American champion of universal health care, Senator Bernie Sanders, who has championed a single-payer, Medicare-for-all reform.\n\nRosenthal is more of an incrementalist. She does not think blowing up the system is realistic. \"This system progressively got built one action at a time, the perversion of one incentive at a time,\" she said. To bring the US more in line with other wealthy countries\u2014in terms of both cost and access\u2014she thinks we need to unravel those perverse incentives, one small step at a time.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Aide George Papadopoulos Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison for Lying to FBI\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, stated on Sunday that he felt \"pinned\" during his interview with FBI agents in January 2017, and that he lied to investigators in an attempt to protect the president.\n\nPapadopoulos, who was sentenced to 14 days in federal prison on Friday for making false statements to the FBI during the early days of the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, was interviewed on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n\"At the time of my interview with the FBI, I think around three or four days before that, I was at the inauguration attending parties with senior-level transition officials,\" Papadopoulos told George Stephanopoulos. \"I understood that there was an incipient investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\"\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his meetings in London with a Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, making him the first person to admit guilt to Robert Mueller in the special counsel's sprawling Russia inquiry.\n\nMifsud told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that he had obtained \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, and would claim to have amassed troves of emails connected to Clinton's campaign, according to Mueller's prosecutors.\n\nPapadopoulos maintained that he was not made aware of the hacks on Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, or the Democratic National Committee, and has testified that he did not tell any Trump campaign officials about his conversation with Mifsud regarding Clinton's emails.\n\nPapadopoulos said he chose to keep the professor's claim under wraps because Paul Manafort, who became the Trump campaign chairman in May 2016, quashed the idea of a potential summit between then-candidate Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which Papadopoulos had been trying to broker.\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday it was unlikely that Papadopoulos did not tell other members of the Trump campaign about his talks with Mifsud.\n\nPapadopoulos also said he had \"no opinion on\" and \"no knowledge of\" Trump's alleged attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation, and could not answer whether the special counsel would be able to demonstrate coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Delegate Challenge as Cruz Outmaneuvers in Delegate Selection Process\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Republican primary race heats up, Donald Trump is facing a growing challenge from Ted Cruz in the delegate selection process, with Cruz's campaign proving more adept in securing delegates for the July convention. The dispute over the nominating process is escalating, with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus responding to Trump's claims of a rigged system.\n\nThe billionaire businessman, during a CNN town hall on Tuesday, accused the establishment of stacking the rules against him. This prompted a sharp rebuke from Priebus. The controversy over the process is intensifying as Cruz's operation has been successful in electing supporters as actual delegates in states like Colorado, where he won all 34 delegates last weekend.\n\nCruz is also working to get allies elected as delegates in states that hold traditional primaries and caucuses, such as Indiana and Virginia. In these states, delegates \"bound\" to Trump, Cruz, or Ohio Gov. John Kasich would have to vote for their respective candidates on the first ballot at the convention. However, if there's no candidate with the necessary 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination, Cruz is counting on his delegate allies to switch to his side on a second ballot, which many would be allowed to do.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Cruz could gain at least 130, and potentially as many as 170 or more, additional delegate votes on a second ballot at an open convention. This would make it more difficult for Trump to secure the nomination, increasing the pressure on the front-runner to clinch the party nod by the final June contests.\n\nThe Trump campaign has missed crucial deadlines in several states to lock up delegates who would remain loyal beyond the first ballot. Trump's team is only now starting to engage in the delegate selection process, choosing the actual people who will attend and vote at the convention. Republicans have already selected delegates in at least nine states, and in others, such as Virginia and Arizona, the deadline to apply to be a delegate has passed.\n\nIn Indiana, for example, the primary won't take place until next month, but the deadline to become a national convention delegate was in mid-March. Anti-Trump forces reportedly have already been lining up delegates who would turn on Trump at a contested convention.\n\n\"Are we concerned? Yes, definitely,\" said Tony Samuel, vice chairman of Trump's Indiana campaign. \"Even if [Trump] jumped into high gear, he can't do it,\" said Shak Hill, a Cruz campaign leader in Virginia. \"That's where he's been shut out of the game.\"\n\nTrump is ramping up his operation, but in some states, he's too late. In Virginia\u2014a state where Trump won the primary\u2014he has missed the deadlines to assemble lists of potential delegates. Cruz, however, has delegate candidates in 10 of Virginia's 11 congressional districts.\n\nIndiana's primary is May 3, but 27 of the state's 57 delegates\u2014the actual people\u2014have already been selected at congressional district caucuses. The deadline to register as a candidate for delegate was March 15.\n\nIn the at least nine states that have picked some or all of their delegates, Trump has won a total of 100 delegates in primaries and caucuses in these states. In most, however, the candidates had no formal role in selecting the people who will fill those slots.\n\nTrump is banking on rallying popular support\u2014which has kept him far out in front in the Republican field\u2014in hopes of winning the nomination outright. However, Cruz and his supporters have accused Trump's campaign of using dirty tricks, such as publishing the home addresses of delegates and threatening to make public the hotel room numbers of delegates at the convention this summer.\n\nCruz accused Trump of being a bully, inciting violence, and using dirty tricks to intimidate voters and delegates during a radio interview on Tuesday. Cruz also criticized Trump over reports that his supporters were threatening delegates in Colorado and delegates at the convention this summer.\n\n\"That is the tactic of union thugs,\" Cruz told host Glenn Beck. \"That is violence. It is oppressive.\"\n\nAs the race continues, both candidates are facing criticism and challenges, with Trump's campaign strategy coming under scrutiny for missing crucial deadlines and Cruz's campaign being accused of using underhanded tactics to gain an advantage in the delegate selection process. The race is heating up, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Former First Lady Laura Bush Condemns Family Separation Policy at U.S.-Mexico Border\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing op-ed published in the Washington Post, former U.S. First Lady Laura Bush has denounced the controversial policy of family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, describing it as cruel, immoral, and heart-breaking.\n\nMrs. Bush, the wife of the former Republican President George W. Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy, which has been a subject of growing controversy under President Donald Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy.\n\n\"This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,\" she wrote in the Washington Post. \"Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.\"\n\nThe policy, which has led to nearly 2,000 family separations in a six-week period following a crackdown on illegal border crossings, has sparked widespread outrage and concern. Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points, many planning to seek asylum, are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centers, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents.\n\nEarlier, Mrs. Trump said she \"hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform.\"\n\nThe first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its \"unconscionable\" strategy of forced separations.\n\nIn a recent visit to shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as inhumane. \"They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon told the BBC.\n\nThe policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number of families trying to enter the US overland without documentation is on the rise, and it is unclear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from traveling.",
    " Title: House Republicans Call for Transparency as House Intelligence Committee Holds Back Trump-Russia Probe Transcripts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter addressed to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), over two dozen House Republicans have urged the release of 53 witness interviews from the committee's Trump-Russia probe, citing a need for transparency and accountability.\n\nThe letter, signed by Representative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, and 27 other Republican lawmakers, criticizes Schiff for allegedly blocking the release of these transcripts. The letter states, \"The American people deserve to have transparency about why public figures such as Chairman Schiff continued to promote such wild accusations.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee initially voted to release the interviews in September 2018. However, the transcripts have yet to be made public, with the Washington Examiner reporting that 43 of the 53 interviews have been declassified, while the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is seeking the review of the remaining 10 transcripts by the White House as part of the declassification process\u2014a move that Schiff has reportedly blocked.\n\nThe Republicans argue that, \"short of full public disclosure,\" they still \"require access to this material for our ongoing oversight of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" On Monday, Jordan and Representative Mike Johnson (R-La.) requested that FBI Director Christopher Wray turn over all documents and communications related to the FBI's \"Crossfire Razor\" investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. The request comes days after the release of FBI notes that Republicans have argued prove Flynn was ensnared in a \"perjury trap.\"\n\nThe letter from the Republican lawmakers also highlights the prolonged allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating, \"For almost four years, prominent Democrat politicians and commentators alleged that President Trump colluded with Russia, with Chairman Schiff going as far as to say that he had 'direct evidence' of collusion.\" The letter concludes by emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in the ongoing investigation.",
    " Title: U.S. and North Korea Engage in Direct Communication over Nuclear and Missile Programs\n\nThe Trump administration has confirmed for the first time that it is in direct communication with North Korea regarding the escalating missile and nuclear programs of the North Korean government. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, during his trip to China's capital, acknowledged that the administration is speaking to North Korea \"directly, through our own channels.\"\n\nTillerson stated that the U.S. has \"three channels\" open with the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He also mentioned that broad sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program \"are beginning to have an effect.\" Tillerson's comments and his visit to Beijing come after North Korea's foreign minister earlier this week accused the U.S. of declaring war.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat described the situation with Pyongyang as \"overheated\" following back-and-forth barbs between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Tillerson blamed North Korea for the rising tensions, stating that if it would stop testing missiles, \"that would calm down things a lot.\"\n\nU.S. Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert issued a statement Saturday, stating that there are \"several open channels\" in which the Trump administration \"can communicate\" with the North Korean government. However, officials in Pyongyang have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.\n\nTillerson reiterated in Beijing on Saturday that a nuclear-armed North Korea will never be acceptable to the U.S. and its allies. The difficult reality of a nuclear-armed North Korea already exists, and it will be challenging to convince North Korea's leaders to change it. The U.S. calculated over the summer that Kim Jong Un's regime controlled as many as 60 nuclear weapons, according to an assessment by U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nAs to the value of negotiating directly with North Korea, U.S. officials, as well as America's allies, have expressed different opinions. While Tillerson says the U.S. is \"directly\" talking with the regime, both Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have said now is not the time to engage with the Kim Jong Un's government. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has remained open to such talks.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Tensions Escalate as Obama and GOP Clash over Debt Ceiling and Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange, President Obama and Republican lawmakers have found themselves at odds over the debt ceiling and spending cuts, with both sides refusing to back down. The latest round of negotiations has seen the White House and GOP leaders trading barbs, with each side accusing the other of irresponsibility and lack of seriousness in addressing the nation's fiscal challenges.\n\nAt a White House news conference on Monday, President Obama criticized Republican threats to hold the line on the nation's borrowing, labeling them as \"irresponsible.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, countered by stating that the upcoming fight over raising the debt limit provides an opportune moment to force Democrats to address the deficit.\n\n\"The president and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,\" said Mr. McConnell. \"I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the president with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country, and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.\"\n\nPresident Obama, in response, called Republican threats to default on the nation's debts \"absurd\" and warned that such a move would send stock markets tumbling and derail any hope of a serious economic recovery this year. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Virginia Republican, immediately pushed back, stating that the talk was more of the same from Mr. Obama.\n\n\"The American people deserve better from Washington. We cannot deliver meaningful change and necessary reforms if we refuse to address out-of-control spending,\" said Mr. Cantor. \"Under President Obama, we have seen record-setting deficit spending and trillions added to our nation's debt. This is a leadership failure.\"\n\nThe White House has also come under fire for its failure to meet the deadline for delivering its budget for the upcoming fiscal year to Congress. The House Budget Committee was informed late last week that the White House would not comply with a Feb. 4 deadline to send its budget to Congress, as required by law.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and vice presidential nominee last year, oversees the panel. \"The Senate hasn't passed a budget in nearly four years, and that is inexcusable,\" he said.\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots, the nation's largest tea party group, has criticized President Obama for driving up the deficit and stalling when it comes to spending cuts, forcing Republicans to take drastic action such as threatening to hold the line on raising the debt limit or shutting down the government to get Democrats to negotiate on spending.\n\n\"It is the president who is holding our economy hostage to his vision of spending more now regardless of the consequences,\" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. \"It is the president whose deadbeat policies handicap our economy and stunt growth. It is the president and his party who pass deadline after deadline without passing a budget so that the American people can review and analyze it.\"\n\nPresident Obama, however, maintains that his November re-election victory is proof that the public supports his plan for higher taxes on the wealthy and a \"balanced\" approach to deficit reduction. He has also rejected suggestions by some congressional Democrats that he bypass Congress in the debt ceiling debate and unilaterally act to ensure the federal government's debts are paid.\n\nThe Treasury, which has been juggling federal finances since the nation hit the debt limit of $16.4 trillion last month, has informed the president and Congress that it will run out of short-term fixes within weeks. Some Republicans, frustrated with the \"fiscal cliff\" deal that Mr. McConnell negotiated with Vice President Joseph R. Biden this month, are starting to embrace the idea of shutting down the government to force Mr. Obama's hand when it comes to cutting spending.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican who helms the GOP conference, told Politico that she thinks House Republicans could very well shut down the government to extract spending cuts from Democrats. The shutdown would be imposed if Congress doesn't pass another spending bill to fund the government's general operations by March 27.\n\nThe White House, citing the impact of the last stalemate over the borrowing limit, has said repeatedly that there will be no negotiations with Republicans over raising the debt ceiling. After months of brinkmanship over the debt limit, the credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's in 2011 downgraded U.S. debt for the first time in 70 years. The government hit the debt ceiling on Dec. 31, but the Treasury started taking emergency measures to allow it to continue to issue debt and prevent any type of default for just a short window of time. The Bipartisan Policy Center says the Treasury will run out of options on meeting the government's bills between Feb. 15 and March 1.",
    " Title: Former Ohio State Wrestlers Allege Rep. Jim Jordan Knew of Sexual Abuse Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the weekend, a seventh former wrestler at Ohio State University came forward, accusing Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) of being aware of the largest sexual abuse scandal in U.S. sports history but doing nothing to stop it. For weeks, Jordan has maintained that, while he was an assistant coach for the Buckeyes wrestling team in the 1980s and 1990s, he was unaware that team trainer Richard Strauss was systematically abusing hundreds of OSU athletes.\n\nThree former wrestlers told NBC News that Jordan had to have known about the allegations, and did nothing to prevent the abuse. Since then, four more former teammates have corroborated those accounts, stating there was no way Jordan was unaware of the abuse. The seventh wrestler came forward on Friday in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\n\"Jim Jordan definitely knew that these things were happening\u2014yes, most definitely,\" said David Range, who wrestled for Ohio State in the late 1980s. \"It was there. He knew about it because it was an everyday occurrence.\"\n\nNo one has yet accused Jordan of engaging in any abusive behavior himself, but several of his former athletes\u2014including some who considered Jordan a friend\u2014have expressed their resentment that the congressman has denied even knowing about the abuse.\n\nIn a Politico report last week, other former Ohio State personnel described the wrestling team as a \"cesspool of deviancy\" during the period in which Jordan served as an assistant coach. Even Jordan's supporters have acknowledged that the toxic culture was widespread and well-known.\n\n\"It was pretty common knowledge it was going on, yes,\" said Rob Archer, a Buckeyes wrestler in the early 1990s who came to Jordan's defense.\n\nJordan himself acknowledged as much during an interview on Fox News Friday evening, seemingly contradicting his earlier pleas of ignorance when he told host Brett Baier, \"Conversations in a locker room are a lot different than allegations of abuse.\"\n\nPart of the hangup appears to be over semantics. In the 1980s, exactly what constituted sexual abuse\u2014as opposed to merely \"inappropriate\" or \"creepy\" behavior\u2014was even less understood than it is today. Jordan has insisted no wrestler ever came to him with a story of \"sexual abuse.\" But Dunyasha Yetts\u2014one of the first wrestlers to come forward, who says he asked Jordan to accompany him to Strauss's office because he feared he would be groped\u2014says it's a difference without a distinction.\n\n\"Yeah, you can say we never told you those words because we didn't know those words,\" Yetts told Politico. \"But for him to say he didn't know? I asked him to come in there with me!\"\n\nNot only has Jordan remained unapologetic for his role in Ohio State's still-unfolding scandal, he has threatened at least one victim of sexual assault with the capitol police. The accusations have threatened to upend Jordan's once-promising political career. His fellow far-right extremists in Congress were urging Jordan to seek a leadership position in the Republican caucus once retiring Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) relinquishes his title as Speaker of the House, and Jordan himself has said he wishes to succeed Ryan as Speaker, a position held by other Republican luminaries including former wrestling coach Dennis Hastert.",
    " Title: Analysis: Greta Thunberg's UN Address and the Youth Climate Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a powerful speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on September 23, 2019, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg criticized world leaders for their inaction on climate change. Thunberg, a 16-year-old from Sweden, accused the adults in power of stealing her dreams and childhood with their empty words.\n\nThunberg's address was the leading edge of a youth movement against climate change that has gained global attention. The movement includes a global \"climate strike\" last week, which was promoted and celebrated by adults who find it useful for their own purposes.\n\nThe use of children as pawns in political debates is not new, and the phrase \"for the children\" has a seductive political appeal. Kids offer their adult supporters a handy two-step: they can claim to be standing up for the future of the planet, while also deflecting criticism by saying, \"How dare you criticize a 16-year-old girl?\"\n\nIt is true that children have a unique perspective on the world, and their voices are an important addition to the climate debate. However, it is also important to recognize that children are still learning and developing, and their understanding of complex issues like climate change is limited.\n\nMuch of the climate advocacy of young people boils down to the plaint that they want action now, and they want it fast. This is understandable, but it is also important to consider the costs and complexity of implementing solutions to climate change.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, by most global measures of social and economic well-being, today's youth are better off than ever before. According to HumanProgress.org, the global poverty rate fell from 28 percent in 1999 to 11 percent in 2013. Life expectancy increased from 63.2 years to 71.9 years from 1981 to 2015. The completion rate for primary school increased from 80 percent in 1981 to 90 percent in 2015.\n\nIf climate change proves a significant challenge, today's youth will have more resources and technology to grapple with it than any other generation in history. However, it is important for adults to provide accurate and nuanced information to children, rather than feeding them a diet of apocalyptic warnings that may be alarmist or inaccurate.\n\nIt is also important for adults to recognize that children are not responsible for the state of the planet, and that it is the adults who have the power to make a difference. It is the adults who have the responsibility to take action, and to provide a safe and sustainable future for the next generation.\n\nIn conclusion, Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit was a powerful call to action for world leaders to take climate change seriously. However, it is important for adults to recognize the limitations of children's understanding of complex issues, and to provide accurate and nuanced information to the next generation. It is also important for adults to take responsibility for the state of the planet, and to work together to create a sustainable future for all.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Historic Climate Change Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards addressing climate change, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have announced that both countries will curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades. The agreement, made during Obama's visit to Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, marks the first time China has agreed to peak its carbon emissions.\n\nUnder the agreement, the United States will reduce its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26% to 28% before 2025. China, on the other hand, will peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and aims to get 20% of its energy from zero-carbon emission sources by the same year.\n\nPresident Obama stated, \"We have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change.\" Xi, in turn, called for an \"energy revolution\" that would include broad economic reforms addressing air pollution.\n\nThe joint announcement is seen as a positive step by experts, who hope it will encourage other nations to tackle climate change. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions described the announcement as \"an extremely hopeful sign.\"\n\nThe goals laid out by Obama and Xi are not as ambitious as some had hoped, but the White House aims to achieve deep economy-wide reductions of 80% by 2050. The Obama administration hopes to sell the plan back home by touting the anticipated savings on energy costs and initiatives and incentives to develop more solar and wind power in both countries.\n\nHowever, the climate change deal has faced criticism from some quarters. The Senate's top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell, stated that the deal will hurt the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, China has agreed to provide another 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar, and other zero-emission generation capacity by 2030, a significant step towards reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nThe U.S.-China agreement also included other significant decisions, such as the importance of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, cybersecurity, strengthening military relations, and increasing trade. The two leaders also agreed to extend the validity of short-term business and tourist visas from one to 10 years, and of student visas from one year to five years, to facilitate travel and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.\n\nDuring Obama's visit to Beijing, the Chinese government took steps to reduce emissions, closing factories and giving employees time off to reduce car traffic. The reduction of smog and the appearance of blue skies were noted by media throughout the APEC summit.",
    " Title: Unaccompanied Central American Immigrants Abandoned in U.S. States, Humanitarian Concerns Rise\n\nArticle:\n\nA surge in the number of unaccompanied Central American immigrants, primarily from El Salvador and Guatemala, attempting to enter the United States illegally via the Rio Grande Valley has led to a controversial practice of transporting and abandoning them in various states, such as Arizona, New York, and Maryland.\n\nLawmakers in Arizona, which has long been grappling with the issue of illegal immigration, have swiftly criticized the practice. Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Smith stated, \"What an astonishing failure of leadership at every level inside the Beltway.\"\n\nIra Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, commented to Reuters, \"Essentially, they have gotten successfully into the country, and it's unlikely that they're going to leave.\"\n\nThe number of apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley has significantly increased in recent years, making south Texas the primary gateway for illegal immigration along the southwest border with Mexico. Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector apprehended 154,453 immigrants last year, up from 97,762 the previous year.\n\nA particularly concerning aspect of this situation is the unprecedented surge of children making the over 1,000-mile journey from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border to escape violence in their home countries. Reports of horrific incidents, including rape and murder of young children, have emerged from border districts.\n\nFloridalma Bineda Portillo and her two young boys were part of a group of about 400 Central Americans who were flown from Texas to Tucson last weekend. Bineda Portillo and others were then transported to Phoenix after the Tucson Greyhound station ran out of space.\n\nUpon their arrival at the station in Phoenix, a volunteer nurse found Bineda Portillo's five-year-old son, Hugo David, wheezing and struggling to breathe. His asthma inhaler had been lost when the family was processed by immigration. Bineda Portillo's three-year-old son developed a cold after sitting on the floor for hours in the detention center, according to his mother.\n\n\"We all started crying because we didn't know what was going to happen to us. It was brutal,\" the Guatemala native said in Spanish.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., told Reuters, \"This is a humanitarian crisis and it requires a humanitarian response.\"\n\nMost of the families apprehended so far in Texas have been flown to Arizona and dropped off by the busload at the station in Phoenix by federal immigration authorities overwhelmed by a surge of families caught crossing the Mexican border into the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated that it does not wish to detain minors in detention centers or separate families. Instead, they are expected to return to Texas on their own once their deportation process nears completion, in an honor system of sorts.\n\n\"After screening by DHS authorities, the family units will be released under supervision and required to report in to a local ICE office near their destination address within 15 days, where their cases will be managed in accordance with current ICE enforcement priorities,\" according to an ICE statement.\n\nBineda Portillo fled Guatemala due to growing violence and domestic abuse. Her mother, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, sent her money for the bus ride there. In the meantime, volunteers from the Phoenix Restoration Project, a humanitarian group, have been at the Greyhound station since Tuesday, handing out food, clothing, diapers, and other supplies.\n\n\"It's always heart-wrenching, especially when we're working with women, because they're less likely to be able to read and sometimes are coming from very rural areas of Central America, and Spanish isn't their first language,\" volunteer Cyndi Whitmore said. \"We see a lot of women who are very scared, very vulnerable.\"",
    " Title: MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace Exposes Altered Video of Pelosi-Trump Clash, Highlights President's Use of Doctored Clips\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to shed light on the recent political discord between President Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House\" host, Nicolle Wallace, aired an altered video clip of herself on Friday to demonstrate the depths to which the president has stooped in his attempts to \"smear\" the Speaker of the House.\n\nWallace, who served as White House communications director during the George W. Bush administration and as a GOP campaign aide, stated that the ongoing feud between Trump and Pelosi has \"deteriorated to a level beneath comprehensible words.\"\n\n\"We believe that transparency is the best disinfectant for dirty politics, so we\u2019re going to break down what the president of the United States did to the Speaker of the House when he shared a doctored video of her with his millions of Twitter followers,\" Wallace said.\n\nThe host pointed out that Trump shared an edited video clip on Thursday that made it appear as if Pelosi was stuttering. The video, while not doctored itself, was shared on the same day The Washington Post reported that doctored videos portraying Pelosi as if she were drunk had gone viral on social media.\n\nWallace noted that the slowed-down video \"has the effect of making anyone look like they\u2019re having a hard time speaking.\" To illustrate this, she aired a clip of herself speaking that had been slowed down, allowing her audience to see what she looked and sounded like doctored.\n\nThe MSNBC host also pointed out that Trump has been a victim of doctored videos himself, playing a clip of a campaign speech that had been altered. Wallace's show decided not to show the clip of Pelosi that Trump shared with his 60.5 million Twitter followers.\n\nOn Friday, Trump denied any knowledge of the altered videos and praised his ability to work with the Democratic leader before accusing her of \"not helping the country.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know about the videos. I can tell you that \u2014 what I\u2019m here is to help the country,\" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a trip to Japan.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Warns Against Complacency as Trump's Campaign Strategy Shifts in Final Days\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton's campaign has expressed caution against complacency as new poll numbers suggest Donald Trump may lead Republicans to a significant victory in just over two weeks. The candidates have adopted contrasting strategies to reach the more than 200 million Americans who have registered to vote.\n\nWhile Clinton is focusing on television advertising, local organizing, and targeting states that were once considered safely Republican, Trump has opted for raucous swing state rallies that some have likened to a rock music tour. The strategy could potentially secure Clinton more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House and help other Democrats regain control of Congress.\n\nAt a rally in Orlando, Florida on Sunday night, Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine suggested Clinton was on track for a \"very big and historic win\" on November 8. However, Clinton campaign aides have acknowledged the risk that Trump could benefit from an unpredictable 2016 electorate, particularly in swing states like Ohio where polling remains tight.\n\nTrump's campaign advisers acknowledge they face an uphill battle, but maintain the country's anti-establishment mood will work in their favor in the final few days. Trump's son, Eric Trump, echoed these sentiments but rejected the idea that his father is playing to his base of support.\n\nSome Republicans are skeptical that Trump can find a way to win, with political strategist Karl Rove expressing doubt that there is enough time left. The Clinton campaign remains confident that it can spare resources on punishing the Republican party for standing with Trump, who has repeatedly broken political norms and energized once shunned leaders, such as former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke.\n\nClinton's campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said the campaign aims to \"extend an open hand\" to traditionally Republican voters while targeting the \"different strain\" within the party that continues to support Trump, despite his offensive remarks about women, immigrants, and minorities. Although many Senate veterans, including John McCain and Kelly Ayotte, have rescinded their endorsements of Trump, he has retained his vocal base and the muted support of House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe Clinton campaign will continue to court \"reasonable Republicans and independents\" who might be willing to defect across party lines. Trump Jr also told ABC that his father would \"100%\" accept the results of the election if it was fair.",
    " Title: Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine Shows Promise in Early-Stage Trial, Larger Study Planned for July\n\nArticle:\n\nCambridge, Mass. \u2013 A candidate vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Moderna and the federal government appears to be safe and triggers an immune response, according to data released Tuesday from an early-phase trial. However, whether this immune response is sufficient to protect individuals from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 remains unclear, according to several experts who reviewed the results.\n\nModerna's chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, stated that although the protective effect of the vaccine cannot technically be known yet, all indications are that mRNA-1273 will be safe and effective. The levels of protective antibodies produced by the trial participants were similar to those found in patients who had recovered from COVID-19, suggesting that the candidate vaccine provides the same protection as an infection. Animal studies show mRNA-1273 can protect mice against infection, and trials in primates and Syrian hamsters are underway.\n\nThe mRNA-1273 candidate did not generate a kind of immune cell that in other diseases made vaccinated people worse off, Zaks said. The clinical trial was led by Anthony Fauci's Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. The experimental vaccine is being created quickly, with a volunteer in Seattle being injected on March 16, just two months after Chinese scientists revealed the virus's genetic sequence.\n\nIn the trial, 45 participants were divided into three groups \u2013 one that received a high dose, one a medium dose, and one a low dose. Each person received two shots, a month apart. All the reactions in the two lower dose groups were mild, with more than half suffering minor fatigue, chills, headache, or muscle pain, as is typical with vaccines. Three of those who received the highest dose had a severe reaction after the second shot, according to the study, including one participant whose fever spiked to 103 degrees. The highest dose, 250 micrograms, was dropped from later-stage trials, and only the 100-microgram dose will be proposed for use in people.\n\nAll the participants showed evidence of an immune response, which is the goal of immunization. COVID-19 is so new that it's not clear how much of an immune response will be needed to protect against infection. \"It looks like their vaccine was able to induce a virus neutralizing antibody, which is positive,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \"But it's hard to know if the level of virus neutralizing antibody will be sufficient to induce protective immunity, or if it compares favorably with other (vaccine) candidates.\"\n\n\"These are good results,\" said Dr. Nadine Rouphael, who helped lead the trial at Emory University School of Medicine. She agreed with Hotez that it's too early to know whether the vaccine will be protective. Neutralizing antibodies are key for fighting other infections, she said, but there are a lot of questions about COVID-19. \"How long will they stay, what's the right level of protection remains to be determined,\" she said Tuesday.\n\nLearning whether the vaccine is protective will require a much larger study. A so-called Phase 3 trial with 30,000 participants is slated to begin on July 27, Zak confirmed. One challenge, Rouphael said, will be to find trial participants who naturally catch COVID-19. In trials for a Zika vaccine, the disease was brought under control, and it was very difficult to determine whether the vaccine was protective, because no one was catching it, she said.\n\nThousands of people volunteered for the small Phase 1 trial, Rouphael said, and she hopes people will continue to sign up for the research. The novel coronavirus works by invading human cells, then forcing them to reproduce the virus in high volumes. One way to stop the disease could be to get the body to produce antibodies in advance that would prevent the virus from penetrating cells. Though the results show people injected produce antibodies, it's not known whether that protects them from getting sick.\n\nModerna relies on a technology the company compared to digitizing vaccines. Rather than injecting someone with a weakened or dead virus, Moderna uses genetic material to trick the body into producing the critical antibodies before a person gets infected. Moderna was founded in 2011, but it has not successfully produced a vaccine. The company, which went public in 2018, will join the NASDAQ-100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nPaul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said it is not easy to understand what's going on in the immune system after vaccinations. Offit helped develop a vaccine against rotavirus, testing it in 35,000 infants and getting blood samples from all of them. The vaccine worked in most babies, he said, but even with so many blood samples, researchers never figured out what was different about the immune systems of the babies who did not get protection. \"You'd think we'd be able to say here's why they were not protected,\" he said, but \"we could not find an immune correlate.\"\n\nThe goal is to have a vaccine ready in limited batches by January, or at the latest next summer. There is no way to tell whether either of those timetables are feasible. Historically, vaccines take many years to develop.

    " Title: Biden, Kaine Lead Obama Administration's Push for Gun Legislation in Wake of Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the contentious issue of gun control, Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, have taken the Obama administration's push for gun legislation outside of Washington, D.C. This move may be a strategic response to the challenges that any gun control bills are likely to face in Congress.\n\nOn Friday, Biden held a round-table discussion in Richmond, Virginia, engaging with individuals who worked on gun safety following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting. Biden, who has become the administration's point person on guns following the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, led the release of recommendations last week that include renewing the assault weapons ban, limiting the size of ammunition magazines, and implementing universal background checks.\n\nDuring the Richmond discussion, Biden emphasized the administration's commitment to continuing its efforts, stating, \"We're going to continue to go around the country and try to get the best minds to give us further insight into what the president is trying to do.\" Senator Kaine, who was governor of Virginia at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, also participated in the discussion.\n\nKaine expressed optimism about the potential for reducing gun violence, stating, \"We do not have to despair about being able to reduce gun violence. There are things you can do that work to reduce gun violence. You can do them by working together.\" He pointed to an improved background records check put into place in Virginia after the shooting as an example of effective policy change.\n\nBiden emphasized the urgency of action in light of the Sandy Hook shooting, stating, \"What happened up in Newtown \u2014 beautiful little babies, 6 and 7 years old, riddled with bullet holes. Twenty of them dead. I've met with most of their parents. It is a national tragedy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, introduced a new assault weapons ban on Thursday. However, she acknowledged the uphill battle this legislation may face, stating, \"This is really an uphill road. If anyone asks today: Can you win this? The answer is we don't know. It's so uphill.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbying group, responded to Feinstein's bill with a statement, saying, \"The senator 'has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades.'\" The NRA expressed confidence that Congress would reject Feinstein's approach.\n\nPhiladelphia's police commissioner, Charles Ramsey, spoke at Feinstein's press conference, expressing hope that this time might be different. \"If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don't know what else will. We have to pass legislation. We can't allow the legislation to get so watered down and filled with loopholes that it is meaningless and won't do anything.\"\n\nBoth Feinstein and the Obama administration's political team are advocating for grassroots support to push for gun control legislation. A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday could provide an early sense of the mood in Congress, with witnesses including Wayne LaPierre of the NRA and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in another mass shooting.",
    " Title: New Revelation Suggests Possible Connection Between Dossier and Death of Ex-KGB Agent\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent disclosure made public on Tuesday has sparked speculation that the death of a former KGB agent, Oleg Erovinkin, in December 2016, may be linked to the publication of an unverified dossier containing allegations against Donald Trump. The connection was made in a 300-page testimony transcript released Tuesday by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which the attorney for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson stated that someone had been killed as a result of the publication of the dossier.\n\nIn the transcript, Joshua Levy, attorney for Glenn Simpson, said, \"Somebody\u2019s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.\" The cryptic reference has led to a guessing game about the identity of the deceased individual.\n\nAccording to a January 2017 report in British newspaper The Telegraph, Erovinkin was a top aide to Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister who was named repeatedly throughout the dossier. Erovinkin and the details of his death were also published in the book \"Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump win\" by British journalist Luke Harding. The book alleges that the street where Erovinkin's body and the car were found was desolate, making it an ideal spot for an assassination.\n\nLocal media reports at the time of his death suggested foul play, but it was later claimed that his death was a result of a heart attack. In the aftermath of his death, media reports speculated that Erovinkin was an unnamed informant for the dossier. Christo Grozev of Risk Management Lab, a think-tank based in Bulgaria, claimed in a January 2017 Haaretz article that Erovinkin was the main source of information for the dossier.\n\nLevy did not immediately return messages requesting information about who he was referring to in his statement. The connection between the dossier and Erovinkin's death remains unconfirmed, and further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of any potential link.",
    " Title: North Korea Threatens Countermeasures Against U.S. Over Joint Military Exercises with South Korea\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has issued a warning to the United States, stating that it will respond with countermeasures if the U.S. proceeds with joint military exercises with South Korea, scheduled to begin in early April. This threat was made in a commentary published by North Korea's official KCNA news agency on Saturday.\n\nThe joint military exercises, a regular occurrence, have been consistently described by the DPRK as a threat. The U.S. is due to start these drills, the latest in a series, according to South Korean presidential security adviser's statement this week, as reported by Yonhap news agency.\n\nThe DPRK's commentary stated that if the U.S. continues with joint military exercises while maintaining sanctions on the DPRK, North Korea will respond with its own mode of counteraction, and the U.S. will bear all resulting responsibilities. The drills, according to the DPRK, will hinder reconciliation efforts on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe DPRK's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was used in the commentary. On February 23, the U.S. announced its largest package of sanctions aimed at pressuring North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. President Donald Trump warned of a \"phase two\" that could be \"very, very unfortunate for the world\" if the steps did not work.\n\nNorth Korea has criticized the unilateral sanctions imposed by the U.S., but it has expressed a willingness to engage in talks with the U.S. during senior North Korean officials' visit to South Korea for the Olympics last month. The White House has stated that any talks with North Korea must lead to an end of its nuclear program.\n\nNorth Korea reiterated on Saturday its readiness to engage in dialogue with the U.S., but it emphasized that it would never engage under any preconditions. A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, as quoted by state media KCNA news agency, said, \"We will neither beg for dialogue nor evade the military option claimed by the U.S.\"\n\nThe spokesman further stated, \"Whether peace desired by our nation and the rest of the world settles on the Korean peninsula or a situation that no one desires is developed in the vicious cycle of confrontation depends entirely on the attitude of the U.S.\"\n\nIn response to an invitation from leader Kim Jong Un, South Korea plans to send a special envoy to North Korea. South Korean President Moon Jae-in informed U.S. President Donald Trump of this plan during a phone call on Thursday. The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang last month provided a boost to recent engagement between the two Koreas after a significant increase in tensions over North Korea's missile program.",
    " Title: Mississippi Senate Runoff: Cindy Hyde-Smith Secures Victory Over Mike Espy in Deeply Conservative State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely watched runoff election on Tuesday, Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith emerged victorious in the Mississippi Senate race, defeating Democrat Mike Espy in the deeply conservative state. With 97 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Hyde-Smith led Mr. Espy by almost 8 percentage points, securing 53.9 percent of the vote to Mr. Espy's 46.1 percent.\n\nThe victory for Ms. Hyde-Smith was in line with most pre-runoff public polls. In a jubilant speech in Jackson, Ms. Hyde-Smith thanked God, her family, and President Trump, who made rally stops in Tupelo and Biloxi on Monday, just hours before polls opened.\n\n\"This is just an unbelievable night,\" she said. \"Mr. President, thank you so much for all of your help.\"\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith also reached out to the entire state, saying, \"I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, I'm going to always represent every Mississippian. I will work very hard, do my very best to make Mississippi proud of its U.S. senator\u2014the people of Mississippi deserve that.\"\n\nMr. Espy addressed a dejected crowd also in Jackson before 10 p.m., much earlier than many people expected the runoff to be decided. He called his opponent \"Senator Hyde-Smith\" and said he had called her to offer his prayers as she goes to Washington to work for a divided Mississippi.\n\nThe runoff, the night's sole race, garnered considerable attention and was closer than recent statewide races in the state. Ms. Hyde-Smith's victory makes her the first woman to be elected U.S. senator in Mississippi, though an Espy win would have made history as well, as he would have become the first black person elected to such office since the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction.\n\nHowever, partisan control of the Senate did not turn on the result; Republicans would have a majority either way, and Ms. Hyde-Smith's win cemented the margin at 53-47. When polls closed at 8 p.m. EST, Mississippi officials estimated that between 30 percent and 40 percent of registered voters had cast ballots.\n\nMr. Espy trailed Ms. Hyde-Smith by just a point on Election Day, but since she failed to break the 50 percent barrier, the election functioned as a sort of jungle primary and led to Tuesday's runoff. Ms. Hyde-Smith's own words and opposition research groups' efforts produced an unwelcome picture of a racially insensitive Mississippian who joked about suppressing the liberal college vote. Democrats tried to magnify that image by blaming Ms. Hyde-Smith for her parents' decision to send her to a segregated academy in Mississippi as a schoolgirl.\n\nTo counter that, Ms. Hyde-Smith repeatedly brought up Mr. Espy's checkered past, which included indictments stemming from his work as agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration. Although Mr. Espy was acquitted at trial of all charges, the Hyde-Smith campaign also unearthed information about Mr. Espy's lucrative lobbying work on behalf of a former Ivory Coast dictator now on trial at the International Criminal Court facing charges of crimes against humanity.\n\nThus, the ebb and flow of the runoff weeks left each candidate with a clear objective. Ms. Hyde-Smith needed to persuade enough Mississippians not to stay home in yet another post-Thanksgiving election, while Mr. Espy worked to show he remained true to his state and was not a creature of the Washington \"swamp.\"\n\nDemocrats hoped Ms. Hyde-Smith's awkward comments, including one about \"a public hanging\" in a state with a dark history of lynchings, would create a scenario similar to last year's special Senate election in adjoining Alabama. But there, Republican Roy Moore faced much graver claims involving underage girls, and he was never a favorite of the Republican establishment.\n\nThose weren't handicaps for Ms. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to the Senate by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant when Sen. Thad Cochran resigned this year for health reasons. Given Ms. Hyde-Smith's support, along with the firm backing of President Trump who made two campaign appearances Monday on her behalf, Mr. Espy had a much steeper climb than Democrat Doug Jones had to capitalize on Mr. Moore's past in Alabama.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith did not apologize for her \"public hanging\" comment until the runoff's only debate on Nov. 20. Nevertheless, the incidents never knocked her off message. She insisted repeatedly that she would \"represent Mississippi's conservative values\" and offered a stark contrast between herself and Mr. Espy on immigration, taxes, business regulation, judicial philosophy, and the Second Amendment.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith's open embrace of Mr. Trump and his agenda also appeared designed to appeal to the nearly 17 percent of Mississippi voters who chose Chris McDaniel, a right-wing former state senator, on Election Day. After his loss, Mr. McDaniel offered a lukewarm endorsement of Ms. Hyde-Smith, saying she was the only candidate left who could help Mr. Trump in Washington.\n\nMr. Espy allowed surrogates to launch most of the attacks against Ms. Hyde-Smith while he positioned himself as a Blue Dog Democrat with a lifelong affection for Mississippi. He insisted he would not be a mindless rubber stamp for the self-styled \"resistance\" to the Trump administration and held himself out as a gun owner who would not give knee-jerk support to any gun control measure.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged he would have voted against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in his contentious confirmation process last month. That provided ripe fruit for Mr. Trump, who in his Mississippi rallies repeatedly highlighted how Ms. Hyde-Smith was the candidate with the judicial philosophy most in tune with Mississippi's majority.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith and Mr. Trump also scoffed at Mr. Espy's claim of independence, saying he would vote in lockstep with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nMr. Espy said he would confront the administration when necessary but try to work with it in most cases, but appearances on the campaign trail for him from Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California and Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, two senators associated with the resurgent left wing, appeared to tie him closely to the Democratic Party's best-known figures in Congress.",
    " Title: Senate Prepares to Debate Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Highlighting Abortion Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is set to discuss the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that aims to address the care of infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The legislation, reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) in January 2019, seeks to mandate that medical care be provided to these infants, following controversial comments made by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam regarding the treatment of such newborns.\n\nLast February, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the born-alive bill, which requires newborns to receive the same level of care as any other infant born at the same gestational age. Critics argue that these infants do not exist, as some claim that attempted abortions never result in living infants. However, this assertion is contradicted by the case of abortionist Kermit Gosnell, whose crimes against newborns were not illegal under federal law.\n\nWhile data on born-alive infants is limited, there is both anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures with some frequency. When confronted with this evidence, Democrats often argue that existing laws are sufficient to prevent infanticide. However, this is not the case, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. Only 33 states, at last count, have such laws in place. New York's legislature repealed the state's born-alive protections last year.\n\nCritics of the bill often label it as \"anti-abortion,\" claiming it would limit healthcare options for women. However, the bill does not regulate when or whether healthcare or abortion may be made available to women. It merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion the same way they would treat any other newborn infant.\n\nThe bill's opponents argue that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This perspective is at the heart of the debate, as the bill aims to expose the dehumanizing rationale behind the argument for abortion.\n\nThough the bill is likely to face opposition in the Senate once more, it serves to highlight the ethical dilemma at the core of the abortion debate. The bill's supporters argue that it is a matter of decency, while its opponents maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect if he or she was planned to have been killed a second before. The debate underscores the complex and deeply personal nature of the abortion issue, and the need for careful consideration and compassionate dialogue.",
    " Title: Al-Qaeda Affiliate in Yemen Murders American Journalist and South African Teacher During Failed US Special Forces Rescue Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen has murdered American journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie during a US special forces rescue operation on Friday night. The terrorists mortally wounded the hostages to prevent them from being rescued, with US special forces reportedly being just moments away at the time. Somers died while being evacuated to a nearby US Navy ship, while Korkie died in the ship's hospital.\n\nThe US, unlike most other countries, refuses to pay ransoms to terrorists. Terrorists in Yemen and elsewhere are trying to force the US to change that policy, in part by murdering American hostages.\n\nAl-Qaeda's Yemen-based branch, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), kidnapped South African teacher Pierre Korkie and his wife Yolande Korkie in May 2013. The group then kidnapped American freelance journalist Luke Somers from the capital city of Sanaa in September 2013. In January, AQAP released Yolande Korkie. This November, US special forces launched a rescue operation elsewhere in Yemen that retrieved eight hostages from AQAP.\n\nOn Wednesday, perhaps in response to the earlier US raid, AQAP announced that it would kill Somers and Korkie if the US did not pay the demanded ransom. On Friday, President Obama approved a US-led special forces operation, along with Yemeni soldiers, to rescue the two hostages, held in a village in southern Yemen. About 100 soldiers descended on the village very late on Friday night. US special forces landed six miles away from the village and hiked in to preserve the element of surprise.\n\nDuring the firefight, US special forces observed a single AQAP militant enter the building where the hostages were held. The militant was only there \"for about a five to seven count... long enough of course to shoot people or take any other action,\" according to a Pentagon official. The militant had attempted to murder the hostages: by the time special forces got to the building, the hostages had both suffered from very serious unspecified injuries.\n\nBoth hostages were loaded onto a helicopter and flown to a nearby US Navy ship. Somers died en-route; Korkie died on the ship hospital operating table.\n\nMost countries pay ransoms when their citizens are taken hostage abroad. The US refuses to do this, believing that paying ransoms would just give terrorists the incentive to kidnap more Americans; instead, it uses the US military to rescue its citizens, which makes taking Americans hostages more dangerous. The US policy is controversial and much-debated but is ultimately meant to protect American lives. South Africa, notoriously, often simply refuses to provide its citizens any help whatsoever; Yolande Korkie's release was negotiated by a charity group because the South African government would not intervene.\n\nOver the past year or two, terrorist groups in the Middle East have been taking more Americans hostage. Terrorist groups in Syria, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have taken several Americans hostage and demanded exorbitant ransoms for their release. During 2014, ISIS has begun murdering its American hostages, beginning with the journalist James Foley, and broadcasting horrific videos of their deaths. While there are surely multiple overlapping reasons that ISIS would do this, one reason that some analysts have suggested is that ISIS may be attempting to compel the US to change its policy on paying ransoms.\n\nPublic outrage in the US over the terrorist murders of American citizens has been significant. While the Obama administration has stepped up efforts to rescue American hostages, AQAP's pledge to murder Somers if it did not receive its ransom\u2014a pledge it ultimately kept\u2014shows that jihadist terrorist groups are committed to forcing the US to start paying ransoms, even at the cost of inviting US special forces raids.\n\nThe recent increase in terrorist groups taking and murdering American hostages, then, can be partially understood as a conflict between jihadists and the United States over America's ransom-paying policy. It is not clear who will prevail\u2014the US government insists it will not bend, but public pressure could change that\u2014but, in the meantime, American journalists and aid workers abroad will continue to be targeted as pawns in the conflict.",
    " Title: New York Times Report Sheds Light on George Papadopoulos' Role in Sparking Counterintelligence Investigation\n\nA new report from The New York Times on Saturday has revealed that a conversation between a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat last year was one of the catalysts for the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Papadopoulos, a 30-year-old energy consultant, told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in May 2016 that the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton. The encounter took place in an upscale London bar, where Papadopoulos was with Downer, who is Australia's top diplomat to the U.K.\n\nA month prior to that encounter, Papadopoulos claims he was told by a London-based associate named Joseph Mifsud that Russian government officials had obtained Clinton emails. It is unclear whether Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his encounters with Mifsud and at least two Russian nationals, told anyone in the Trump campaign about the alleged Clinton dirt.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The FBI caught wind of Papadopoulos' claims more than two months after the London meeting with Downer. The Australian government decided to share the information with U.S. investigators after emails stolen from Democrats began to be released by WikiLeaks.\n\nAccording to the Times, current and former law enforcement officials said that the Papadopoulos lead\u2014and not the infamous Steele dossier\u2014was what sparked the counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin operatives.\n\nFormer British spy Christopher Steele met with the FBI in July 2016 to share some of his findings from an investigation he was conducting of Trump on behalf of Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was working for the Clinton campaign and DNC.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have questioned how heavily the FBI relied on the dossier for the Russia probe and for a secret surveillance warrant obtained in Sept. 2016 against Carter Page, another Trump campaign adviser. Page is accused in the dossier of being the Trump campaign's liaison to the Kremlin. He denies the allegation.\n\nThe Times reported earlier this year that the FBI's investigation was also sparked by a trip that Page made to Moscow in July 2016, while he was still with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Times also provided new details about Papadopoulos' interactions with an alleged source for the dossier. According to the newspaper, Papadopoulos met several times during the summer leading up to the election with Sergei Millian, the chairman of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce. Millian has been identified as a source for some of the more salacious allegations about blackmail material on Trump and about collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin. Millian, who was born in Belarus, has denied being a source for the dossier.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Vows to Release Redacted Mueller Report Within a Week, Faces Criticism from Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr, in his first appearance before Congress since revealing the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, pledged on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the report within a week. Barr testified before a congressional panel on Capitol Hill, where he faced criticism from Democrats over his handling of the initial summary of the report.\n\nBarr stated that his office is currently working with the special counsel to prepare the report for public release. \"Right now, the special counsel is working with us. This process is going along very well, and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,\" Barr testified. \"From my standpoint, within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public, and then I will engage with both chairmen of the Judiciary Committees on any requests that they have.\"\n\nBarr identified four areas of the report that he believes should be redacted, including grand jury material, information that could reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of \"peripheral players.\" The Justice Department, with the help of the special counsel's office, plans to \"color code the decisions from the report and provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.\"\n\nDespite Barr's assurances, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) accused Barr of \"cherry-picking\" from the report to \"draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president\" in releasing the four-page summary last month on its findings. Other Democrats made similar comments during the hearing, which was originally meant to address Barr's fiscal 2020 spending request for the Justice Department.\n\nLawmakers focused on Barr's four-page summary of the special counsel report, where he stated that there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel also reviewed whether the president had obstructed justice in any way, but ultimately did not come to a conclusion on that issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, though, said the evidence was \"not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nIn her fiery opening statement, Lowey criticized Barr's handling of the report as \"unacceptable.\" \"I must say, it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence, legal documents, and findings based on a 22-month long inquiry and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours,\" Lowey said. \"Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.\"\n\nAfter repeated exchanges about the report, Barr appeared to bristle at questions from Democrats about the report's process and contents. Under subsequent questioning from Lowey, Barr said he would not discuss the report any further and made clear that he has no plans at the moment to initially release the unredacted version to committees.\n\nIn a statement last week, the DOJ defended Barr's rollout of Mueller's conclusions. \"Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately\u2014without attempting to summarize the report\u2014with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process,\" the Justice Department statement said. The statement also said that every page of Mueller's report was marked that it may contain grand jury material \"and therefore could not immediately be released.\"",
    " Title: U.N. Report Warns of Resurgence of Al Qaeda in Middle East, Led by Usama bin Laden's Son\n\nArticle:\n\nA United Nations panel has issued a warning that the next major terror threat in the Middle East could emanate from Al Qaeda, led by the son of Usama bin Laden. The report, delivered to the Security Council and released this week, provides a detailed analysis of both terror networks.\n\nThe report indicates that while the Islamic State (ISIS) has been militarily defeated in Iraq and most of Syria, it still maintains approximately 20,000-30,000 members in the two countries. Despite significant military victories against the group in 2017, ISIS is transitioning from a proto-State network to a covert network, posing a continued threat to other countries, with its leadership, under Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, still intact.\n\nIn contrast, the report highlights Al Qaeda as a global network that demonstrates resilience, and is stronger than ISIS in regions such as Somalia, Yemen, and South Asia. The leadership of Al Qaeda in Iran has grown more prominent, and Usama bin Laden's son, Hamza bin Laden, has emerged as a significant leadership figure within the organization.\n\nThe report states that while there is little evidence, as yet, of a direct global threat from Al Qaeda, improved leadership and enhanced communication will likely increase the threat over time, as will any rise in the tendency, already visible in some regions, of ISIS supporters joining Al Qaeda.\n\nThe report's release coincides with growing international concern about the civil war in Yemen between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-backed Houthis. Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) has gained a foothold in the south of the war-torn country amid the chaos in the region.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the Saudi-led coalition has been cutting secret deals with Al Qaeda fighters, paying some to leave cities and towns, allowing others to retreat with weapons and cash. Others were recruited to join the coalition. Participants in these agreements claim that the U.S. was aware of these arrangements and held off on drone strikes.\n\nThe U.N. Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has invited both sides of the conflict to meet in Geneva for talks in September. The looming threat of Al Qaeda, led by the son of the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, underscores the need for continued vigilance and cooperation in the global fight against terrorism.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Gather at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. - The Democratic presidential candidates gathered at U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn's annual fish fry on Friday, marking the largest turnout of candidates yet and offering a platform for them to engage with black voters, a significant demographic in the early primary state next year.\n\nTwenty-one of the 24 major Democratic candidates attended the event, which serves as an unofficial kickoff to the Democratic primary race in South Carolina. The gathering, hosted by Clyburn, the highest-ranking black lawmaker in Congress, drew an estimated 4,400 pounds of fried fish and 6,400 slices of bread.\n\nSouth Carolina holds the fourth nominating contest early next year, and the first in which a significant proportion of the Democratic electorate - about 60 percent - is black. The state, which swings strongly Republican, has not elected a Democratic president since 1976. In 2016, Republican President Donald Trump won South Carolina with 54.9 percent of the vote.\n\nWith the Democratic race still in its nascent stages, political strategists say the state is any candidate's to win. Two contenders, U.S. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, have invested heavily in South Carolina and view it as critical to their path to the nomination. However, the candidates, who are both black and frequently discuss race during their campaigns, have not seen a corresponding bump in polls.\n\nBy the end of this weekend, Harris and Booker will have attended 31 and 27 events in the state, respectively, according to a tally by the Post and Courier newspaper in Charleston, South Carolina. Yet, former Vice President Joe Biden, who has attended only four campaign events in South Carolina ahead of this weekend, netted a 20 percentage point-lead in a Post and Courier-Change Research Poll of 933 likely primary voters taken June 11-14.\n\nThe poll showed overall support for Biden softening to 37 percent from 46 percent two weeks after his campaign launch in late April. But the former vice president maintained a dominant lead among black voters at 52 percent. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, both picked up support overall, coming in second and third place with 17 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Harris and Booker each ticked up 1 percent from the month prior, coming in at 9 percent and 5 percent.\n\nSeawright cautioned that at this point in the race, polls nationwide and in South Carolina mainly reflect familiarity with the candidates. Biden enjoys widespread name recognition due to serving eight years as vice president for Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president.\n\nAt a recent happy hour for progressive voters in suburban Charleston, the eight loyal Democrats in attendance said they welcomed the attention the large and diverse Democratic field was lavishing on South Carolina. All agreed they would enthusiastically support the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 2020 general election against President Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee, even if they were not their first choice in the primary.\n\nLaurie Steinke, 61, said she first \"met and fell in love with Kamala Harris,\" then considered Buttigieg. She drove across the state to see Booker before \"Elizabeth Warren came to town and blew me away.\"\n\nMany South Carolina primary voters live in rural areas without high-speed broadband internet, requiring outreach in the state to be done on the ground, Seawright said.\n\n\"You can't just do the new wave of campaigning where you run digital ads and get on TV,\" Seawright said. \"You have to have a real grassroots activated program, knocking on doors, visiting synagogues and places of worship, showing up at community events, going to the fish fries, going to family reunions.\"\n\nHarris on Wednesday stepped up her outreach to historically black colleges and universities by adding a section to her campaign website dedicated to organizing student groups, particularly fraternities and sororities. South Carolina has eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and Harris attended another, Howard University, in Washington.\n\n\"Kamala Harris intends to win South Carolina, which is why we're the first to have paid organizers and prominent endorsers in every region of the state,\" South Carolina director Jalisa Washington-Price told the media.\n\nMontana Governor Steve Bullock, former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska, and Buttigieg were the only declared candidates who were not present at the fish fry, which Clyburn began hosting three decades ago. Clyburn has not yet endorsed any of the Democratic contenders.\n\nMany of the Democratic candidates attending the fish fry echoed the sentiment that once the primary is over, the party should unite behind its nominee.\n\n\"When the primary is over, we become a united force,\" Booker said.",
    " Title: Puerto Rico Governor Requests Investigation into Whitefish Energy Contract Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office on Wednesday, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello requested a review of the contract awarded to Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based company, to restore power on the island. The request followed a Twitter feud between the governor and Whitefish Energy, which has been criticized for its relative lack of experience and political connections.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the $300 million contract has fueled questions about how Whitefish secured the contract, particularly given its small size and its location in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's hometown. In the letter, Rossello requested a review of the Whitefish Contract by Monday, October 30, 2017.\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a frequent opponent of President Donald Trump, engaged in a brief Twitter battle with Whitefish after the governor made the request. Cruz accused the company of \"admitting political motivations.\" In response, Whitefish Energy tweeted, \"We\u2019ve got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived. Do you want us to send them back or keep working?\"\n\nCruz responded, \"If @WhitefishEnergy feels that asking for transparency is'misplaced,' what are they afraid we will find?\" Whitefish Energy's response was met with criticism from Cruz, who stated, \"They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to work for the public sector.\"\n\nCruz called the contract \"alarming\" in an interview with Yahoo News on Wednesday and said it should be \"voided.\" Whitefish later apologized for its comments, stating, \"We have a strong team on the ground, we are working hard and making good progress.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have also called for an investigation into the contract. Many lawmakers questioned why the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had chosen to work with Whitefish instead of reaching out to the American Public Power Association, which normally matches states hit by disasters with nearby public power utilities who have offered up crews and equipment.\n\nFounded in 2015, Whitefish says it has mobilized a team of nearly 300 subcontractors in Puerto Rico to help restore the island's electrical infrastructure in the wake of Hurricane Maria. The company says it called Puerto Rico before Maria hit to pitch its own services.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., defended Whitefish, stating, \"We want to see restoration pick up. Every day that they're without power is a day that the economy isn't functioning and it's another day people are suffering.\"\n\nGovernor Rossello stated that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also had questions about how the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority had awarded the contract to Whitefish Energy, which had just two full-time employees when the contract was signed. However, FEMA had no comment on the contract at this time because \"it appeared to comply 100 percent with FEMA regulations.\"\n\nOnly 25 percent of the island has power 35 days after Maria hit the island, according to the governor's office.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Expands Mexico City Policy, Allocating $8.8 Billion for Pro-Life Global Health Assistance\n\nThe Trump administration is set to announce a significant expansion of the Mexico City Policy, also known as the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" on Monday. The policy, which prohibits non-governmental organizations from performing or promoting abortion as a method of family planning in foreign nations, will now cover a broader range of global health assistance funds and government programs, totaling $8.8 billion.\n\nThe new policy, which is more extensive than when President George W. Bush reinstated it in 2001, will be implemented through various federal agencies and departments. The funds will be allocated to the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe key difference lies in the application of the policy to a wider pool of money within federal agency programs, including Department of Defense programs, as opposed to the previous versions where the funds only applied to family-planning assistance provided by USAID and the Department of State. The total amount of federal funds allocated to health programs worldwide will remain unchanged.\n\nThe policy will apply to global health assistance funding for international health programs such as those for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning and reproductive health. However, it will not apply to humanitarian assistance such as migration and refugee-assistance activities, USAID disaster and humanitarian-relief activities, and U.S. Department of Defense disaster and humanitarian relief.\n\nNon-governmental organizations that refuse to comply with the pro-life guidelines will lose out on the funding, but the funds will be given to other organizations that do adhere to the policy. The White House official clarified, \"Foreign NGOs that agree not to perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, or provide financial support to any other foreign non-governmental organization that conducts such activities, will remain eligible for global health assistance funding.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's move is expected to be well-received by a majority of Americans, as a Marist Poll in January showed 83 percent of Americans oppose federal funding of overseas abortions. This policy shift is another example of the Trump administration's commitment to pro-life issues, a key concern for many evangelical voters.",
    " Title: A Chronological Account of Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against President Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chronological order, at least 25 women have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump since the 1970s. The following is a summary of the allegations made by these women:\n\n1. In the 1970s, Zeta Jones, a former employee of Trump's, accused him of making unwanted advances and verbally harassing her.\n\n2. In the 1980s, Karena Virginia alleged that Trump forcibly kissed her in 1997 at a New York nightclub.\n\n3. In the 1990s, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality show, The Apprentice, claimed that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007.\n\n4. In the mid-1990s, E. Jean Carroll accused President Trump of sexually assaulting her by forcing his penis inside her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room.\n\n5. In 2005, Trump was recorded boasting about grabbing women's genitals in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape. This led to a deluge of women making their allegations public.\n\n6. In 2005, Rachel Crooks, a former Trump Tower receptionist, claimed that Trump forcibly kissed her in 2005.\n\n7. In 2005, Jessica Leeds alleged that Trump groped her breasts and tried to reach up her skirt during a flight in the early 1980s.\n\n8. In 2005, Ninni Laurens, a former Miss Sweden, claimed that Trump walked in on her naked in a dressing room at the Miss Universe pageant in 1997.\n\n9. In 2005, Temple Taggart McDougal, a former Miss Utah, claimed that Trump kissed her on the lips multiple times without consent during pageant meetings in 1997.\n\n10. In 2006, Mindy McGillivray, a former golf course employee, claimed that Trump groped her buttocks at his Mar-a-Lago club in 2003.\n\n11. In 2006, Jessica Drake, a porn star, claimed that Trump made advances towards her in 2006, offering her money for sex.\n\n12. In 2007, Alva Johnson, a former campaign aide, claimed that Trump kissed her without consent in 2016.\n\n13. In 2007, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, claimed that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007.\n\n14. In 2008, Tiffany Doe, a former employee of Trump's golf club, claimed that Trump walked in on her changing and made lewd comments.\n\n15. In 2013, Jill Harth, a former business partner, claimed that Trump groped her, forcibly kissed her, and exposed himself to her in the 1990s.\n\n16. In 2015, Kristin Anderson, a former model, claimed that Trump groped her in a crowded bar in 2007.\n\n17. In 2015, Rachel Crooks, a former Trump Tower receptionist, claimed that Trump forcibly kissed her in 2005.\n\n18.

    " Title: Supreme Court Hearing on Proposition 8: A Closer Look at the Arguments Presented\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the highly anticipated Supreme Court hearing on Proposition 8, A. Charles J. Cooper, representing the proponents of the ban on same-sex marriage, will have half an hour to address questions regarding his clients' standing and the reasons offered to support the ban. On the other side, Theodore B. Olson, representing the couples challenging the ban, will have 20 minutes to argue why the issue should be withdrawn from public debate and a fast-moving political process. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli will have 10 minutes, and he is expected to be questioned about shifts in the Obama administration's positions.\n\nThe crux of the argument lies in the interpretation of equal protection principles. In typical cases, courts assess whether a federal law violates these principles by determining if the law can be justified by a rational reason. This standard, though low, has been used to strike down laws discriminating against gay men and lesbians. Gay rights advocates are hoping that the Supreme Court will adopt a more stringent standard of review, \"heightened scrutiny,\" which requires a showing that the challenged law is \"substantially related to an important government objective.\" A victory on this point could potentially invalidate all same-sex marriage bans.\n\nThe proponents of Proposition 8 argue that preserving the traditional definition of marriage will \"further society's vital interests in responsible procreation and child rearing.\" They contend that redefining marriage as a genderless institution would undermine these interests. They also argue that caution should be exercised when changing the definition of marriage, respecting societal judgments made through the democratic process.\n\nOn the contrary, they are met with the argument that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry would not increase the likelihood of irresponsible behavior among straight couples. They also emphasize the importance of courts protecting the fundamental rights of disfavored minorities.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who is widely considered to hold the decisive vote, is the author of the two leading gay rights cases. His stance remains uncertain, but his questions during the hearing may provide insight into his potential decision. Chief Justice John Roberts may show interest in the standing question, and his inquiries on this issue could suggest whether he might find dismissal on that ground an attractive option.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could range from requiring all states to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, to stating that the Constitution is silent on the issue, leaving states free to allow or reject same-sex marriage. The court could also adopt a rationale that would apply only to California, or it could suggest the \"eight-state solution\" proposed by the Obama administration. Alternatively, it could dismiss the case for lack of standing, which would effectively allow same-sex marriages in California.",
    " Title: Dispute Arises over Attribution of Malware Used in Target Data Breach\n\nA California-based cybersecurity firm, IntelCrawler, has named a 17-year-old Russian teenager as the author of the malware responsible for the massive data breach at Target during the holiday season. However, this assertion has been disputed by Brian Krebs, the widely followed Internet security blogger who initially broke the Target story.\n\nIntelCrawler, based in Los Angeles, claimed late Friday that the teenager, who is reportedly close to 17 years old, authored the malicious software and sold it for approximately $2,000 to dozens of cybercriminals in Eastern Europe and other countries.\n\nHowever, Brian Krebs disputed this information in an interview and on Twitter, stating, \"We do not think we are wrong.\" In response, IntelCrawler president Dan Clements reiterated the firm's stance on Sunday.\n\nWhile IntelCrawler attributes the teen as the author of the malware, it does not allege that he perpetrated the breach. Clements explains that IntelCrawler's CEO did a report on the malware, known as BlackPOS, earlier last year, and the teen was identified then as the author and allegedly is a well-known programmer of malicious code in the underground world.\n\nTarget, the second-largest retailer in the U.S., has previously apologized for the security breach, which affected up to 110 million shoppers. The same malware may have been involved in a similar but smaller attack on luxury retailer Neiman Marcus around the same time, according to IntelCrawler. Neiman Marcus has not disclosed the number of customers affected by its breach.\n\nBoth retailers had no further comment on the incidents on Sunday. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries.\n\nThe software reportedly enabled the thieves to remotely hack into Target's computer systems and obtain customer credit card numbers and other information, which was then sent back to a computer controlled by cyber thieves. State and federal officials, including the Secret Service, have launched an extensive investigation into the breaches.",
    " Title: Federal Regulator Approves Palcohol: Powdered Alcohol for Sale in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) has given approval for the sale of Palcohol, a powdered alcohol product, in the United States. The product, which had initially received approval last year but was later rescinded due to labeling errors, has now been given the green light for four varieties: cosmopolitan, margarita, vodka, and rum.\n\nThe approval comes as a step forward for a small company whose product has sparked controversy due to concerns about potential abuse by minors, the possibility of snorting the powder, and the ease of sneaking alcohol into public events or spiking drinks.\n\nSeveral states, including Colorado, have already moved to ban powdered alcohol. Colorado lawmakers advanced legislation last month to halt its sale, but the bill has since been amended to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it receives federal approval.\n\nConcerns about Palcohol's potential for abuse have been raised, with critics arguing that the lightweight nature of the product could make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks. The product comes in a pouch, with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink.\n\nPalcohol founder Mark Phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early Wednesday morning. Phillips, who came up with the idea for Palcohol as a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles, said in a subsequent email that pricing has not yet been determined.\n\nTTB spokesman Tom Hogue explained that the bureau regularly reaches out to the Food and Drug Administration to get determinations on whether a product might be considered \"adulterated.\" If the FDA says the product is not adulterated, the TTB's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what's in the product.\n\n\"Potential for abuse is not grounds for us to deny a label,\" Hogue said. The TTB expects another Palcohol product, Lemon Drop, to be approved shortly.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Years-Long Challenge in Rebuilding Political Infrastructure and Broadening Appeal\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the 2012 election, the Republican Party is grappling with a significant defeat that has exposed deep-seated weaknesses in their political infrastructure and demographic appeal. The election results have left the GOP with a daunting task of reaching out to voters beyond their predominantly white, male base and modernizing a voter turnout machine that is outdated.\n\nThe consensus among party leaders is that the GOP faces a multi-year challenge of diversifying and updating their political strategy. The question of how to achieve this transformation is a complex one, with no easy answers. However, there is a broad agreement that it will require national leadership from a charismatic politician, such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to initiate the process of recovery.\n\nThe Republican Party, currently a fragmented institution with power divided among traditional organizations like the Republican National Committee, the two chambers of Congress, and numerous outside groups, needs to consolidate its power to address the structural problems that led to the party's defeat on Tuesday.\n\nOhio Sen. Rob Portman described the election results as a \"wake-up call,\" while West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito acknowledged that the party needs to confront the reality that they are \"not diversified like the country\" and risk losing women voters and minorities in future elections. Capito emphasized the need for the party to be more inclusive, stating, \"We're not diversified like the country. We can't keep leaving people out.\"\n\nVirginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, Mitt Romney's state chairman in the Old Dominion and a candidate for governor in 2013, admitted that the Republican \"voter identification and mobilization... didn't produce the kind of results that we thought it would produce.\" Bolling emphasized the need for the party to improve outreach to women, Latinos, and young voters to have a chance of winning national elections in the future.\n\nThe sense of shock that set in on election night, as Republicans realized that Barack Obama might win reelection, deepened into a more depressive mood on Wednesday as the extent of the party's defeat became clear. The GOP now faces a challenging road ahead as they seek to rebuild and broaden their appeal to the American electorate.",
    " Title: Justice Department Seeks New Method to Include Citizenship Question in 2020 Census Amidst Ongoing Legal Battle\n\nThe 2020 census forms have been printed, but the U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly seeking a new method to include a question about citizenship status, despite the Supreme Court's previous ruling against the inclusion of such a question.\n\nThe 2020 census form does not contain a question asking respondents whether they are U.S. citizens. The Trump administration had initially sought to include this question, but the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled against the administration's request for now. However, a Justice Department official stated yesterday that they are still looking for a way to include the citizenship question on the 2020 census forms.\n\nThe development appears to have been prompted by a tweet from President Trump, suggesting that reports of the Commerce Department giving up on the citizenship question are not accurate. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang, who has been extensively covering the census, explains the current situation.\n\n\"This is all over this question that asks, 'Is this person a citizen of the United States?' The Department of Justice earlier this week told us that the printing has started without this question for the 2020 census forms,\" Wang said. \"But then, the next day, President Trump tweeted that he essentially has - any reports that the Commerce Department has given up on asking for this question, that's - those are not true.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's reasoning for not allowing the question was that the administration's justification for the question, to help better enforce the Voting Rights Act, was found to be contrived. The court stated that the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, does have the authority to add the question, but a legitimate reason was not provided.\n\nThe Justice Department has stated in a letter to a federal judge in New York that they are instructed to look for another way to ask for the citizenship question and get it onto the 2020 census forms. This would require figuring out a new justification for the question. The big question is whether this new justification would pass the test of the courts and whether the courts would believe that it is a reasonable and legal way to get the question on the census.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland has set a deadline of Friday 2 p.m. Eastern for the Justice Department to inform the court of its plans. The judge in Maryland is also ready to reopen and reconsider already-filed allegations against the question, that the decision to add the question was intended to discriminate against immigrant communities of color and that there was a conspiracy amongst Trump administration officials.\n\nThe 2020 census officially starts in January, and it is crucial to finalize the questions on the form to ensure a count happens on time. This count includes every person living in the country.",
    " Title: Rep. Maxine Waters Warns Threateners to \"Shoot Straight\" Amidst Escalating Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally held in Los Angeles over the weekend, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) warned those who might intend to harm her, stating, \"Shoot straight because there's nothing like a wounded animal.\" The statement was made in response to the cancellation of speaking engagements in Alabama and Texas due to death threats.\n\nThe threats followed Waters' call for opponents of President Donald Trump's immigration policies to confront and harass members of his Cabinet in public settings. In her remarks last weekend, Waters seemed to refer to incidents such as the confrontation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Washington, D.C. Mexican restaurant and the expulsion of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders from a Virginia restaurant due to her association with the Trump administration.\n\nWaters, who has repeatedly advocated for Trump's impeachment, has previously suggested that those who might consider shooting at her should aim accurately. This was evident in a town hall meeting in Inglewood last year, when Waters, while criticizing Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, heard a pop. She responded to the crowd, \"I don\u2019t know what the sound was, but whoever it is, if it\u2019s a shot, you better shoot straight!\"\n\nPresident Trump responded to Waters' calls for activists to confront White House officials on Monday, tweeting, \"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\"\n\nThe escalating political tensions between Waters and the Trump administration continue to draw attention and concern as both sides express their views publicly.",
    " Title: Tension Mounts Over Superdelegate Influence in Democratic and Republican Presidential Races\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the race for the presidential nominations in both the Democratic and Republican parties heats up, tensions are rising over the role of superdelegates, party leaders who can vote for any candidate they choose at the national conventions.\n\nOn the Democratic side, supporters of Bernie Sanders argue that their votes are being effectively nullified by the superdelegates. Jordan Float, a 25-year-old nursing assistant at a Philadelphia hospital and a volunteer with the Sanders campaign, expressed his frustration, stating, \"Our presidents, our congressmen, anyone in Washington, should not be decided by anyone but the public.\"\n\nSanders himself has criticized the \"rigged political system,\" but he has been less caustic about the influence of superdelegates, recognizing the need to win their support. Meanwhile, there is a sense on the Hillary Clinton side that the system is not completely fair. A superdelegate supporting Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Morillo, has stated he would withhold his vote if the race came down to party leaders like him.\n\nIn response to criticism, some of Sanders' supporters have toned down their attacks. The \"Superdelegate Hit List,\" created by a supporter of Sanders, no longer uses the word \"Hit\" and now depicts telephone cords instead of arrows behind the donkey's head.\n\nThe anxiety over the process is more pronounced on the Republican side due to the possibility that front-runner Donald Trump may not secure the nomination before the convention. Trump is currently at risk of falling short of the 50 percent-plus-one delegate threshold set by the Republican National Committee to clinch the nomination.\n\nTrump and his supporters have been vocal in their criticism of the process, fueling fears that his delegates could be \"stolen\" at the convention. One of Trump's longtime associates, Roger Stone, has been urging mass protests at the national convention in Cleveland in July. Stone has also threatened to publicize the hotel room numbers of delegates who switch their votes against Trump.\n\nThis heightened tension over the delegate process underscores the intensity of the 2016 presidential race and the significant role that party leaders continue to play in determining the nominees.",
    " Title: Twitter's Uncertain Role as a Political Platform: A Decade of Struggling to Balance Free Speech and Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn June 2009, Twitter found itself in uncharted territory as two of its top executives, co-founder Biz Stone and board member Jason Goldman, grappled with the political implications of the social media platform. The Iranian protests against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were unfolding, and Twitter was being used as a tool for communication and organization among the protesters, under the hashtag #ChangeforIran.\n\nIn a blog post drafted in a small office at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, Stone and Goldman announced that they would postpone the site's scheduled maintenance during the protests. The decision was made after a series of phone calls and emails with senior staffers at the State Department, who had asked for the delay. This marked a turning point for Twitter, as it transitioned from a platform for connecting with friends at social events to a tool for political activism.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and Twitter continues to grapple with its role in political discourse. The platform has become a battleground for a wide range of ideological and political debates, from fascists and snowflakes, to neocons and conservatives, to feminists and climate-change deniers. The platform's brevity and immediacy make it a prime location for heated exchanges and controversial statements, such as President Trump's recent tweet regarding nuclear button exchanges with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nTwitter's founders may not have intended for the platform to become a political arbiter, but its centrality as a communications platform for these kinds of exchanges is undeniable. The question of who the \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" are, and how to deal with them, remains a challenge for Twitter.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this month, CEO Jack Dorsey stated that Twitter would not ban world leaders, including President Trump, from the platform, even if they broke rules or regulations. The company argued that such a move would hide important information and hinder necessary discussion. However, this decision has been met with frustration from many, who argue that Twitter's inconsistent handling of volatile conversations and its seeming inability to make decisions in a coherent manner is causing confusion and exacerbating tensions.\n\nTwitter's struggle to balance free speech and responsibility is further complicated by its status as a public company with over 4,000 employees and $2.5 billion in revenue. At the same time, many of its employees are committed to making the world a better place, which may explain their reluctance to place limits on free speech, as was the case during the Iranian protests of 2009. This, along with the company's leadership changes, may help explain Twitter's inconsistent approach to managing volatile conversations.\n\nIn conclusion, Twitter's role as a political platform is complex and fraught with challenges. The company's founders may not have intended for the platform to become a political arbiter, but its centrality as a communications platform for political discourse is undeniable. As the company continues to grapple with its role in political discourse, it remains to be seen how it will navigate the complex and often contentious political landscape.",
    " Title: Trump's Post-Midterm Assessment: A Shift Towards a More Trumpian Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a post-mortem of the Republican electoral losses during the midterm elections, President Donald Trump delivered a candid assessment of the party's performance in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday. The President, who did not express remorse, criticized several members of his own party who distanced themselves from his presidency, with Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) being a notable example.\n\nDespite the race between Love and her Democratic challenger Ben McAdams still not officially called, with about 5,000 votes separating them and 30 percent of precincts yet to report, Trump criticized Love for not fully embracing Trumpism. The day after the midterm elections often lends itself to sitting presidents delivering frank assessments of their parties' performances, with past presidents like George W. Bush and Barack Obama offering candid appraisals in 2006 and 2010, respectively.\n\nTrump's remarks, while sharing the candor of his predecessors, lacked the humility. He listed candidates who won after he campaigned for them, while mocking some of his fellow Republicans who \"did not want the embrace\" from him so close to the election. \"I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad,\" Trump said, \"I think I feel just fine about it.\"\n\nThe transformation of the Republican Party into the \"party of Trump\" was evident in the midterm elections, with the President's remarks resonating with many commentators and analysts. The specifics of their arguments differ, but the central thesis is the same: the Republican Party is now \"decidedly more Trumpian,\" as The Federalist's Ben Domenech put it, having seen the elimination of its most moderate and Trump-critical members, and the support of those who embraced Trump emphatically on the campaign trail and in policy preferences.\n\nThe effect may be more pronounced in the Senate, where several GOP senators who were at times thorns in Trump's side are now gone. This includes the late John McCain (R-Ariz.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), both of whom are retiring. Marsha Blackburn, who was elected Tuesday to replace Corker, made Trump's endorsement a centerpiece of her campaign, symbolizing the transformation of the GOP on the national stage.\n\nTuesday's outcome also boosted Trump by widening the Senate's Republican majority. With a 54-seat majority (which seems the most likely outcome, though a few races remain undecided), the moderates that remain will have less power to bend the chamber's will. Senators like Susan Collins (R-Maine) or Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) will have fewer opportunities to fill the swing-vote role that McCain did on the Obamacare repeal or Flake did on Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\nThe only obviously Trump-skeptical Republican to win a statewide race on Tuesday\u2014the newly elected senator-to-be from Utah, Mitt Romney\u2014may not have much leverage either. Trump is despised in Utah, so selectively opposing the president's agenda should not carry a high political price for Romney, but he also does not seem like the likely leader of a Senate GOP opposition movement.\n\nWhen re-watching Trump's press conference, it was striking how deliberate the President's shots at other Republicans were. The \"sorry, Mia\" might have been typical Trumpian ad-libbing, but the rest was decidedly not. Trump was reading from a card most of the time, including the moment when he helpfully laid out exactly what it means to \"embrace\" Trumpism. This was not Trump talking off the cuff. The White House was deliberately conveying a specific message to Republicans: Trump is now the center of conservatism.\n\nOne of the strongest rebukes of Trump's comments about Love and other Republicans who lost on Tuesday came from Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Penn.), who said on Twitter that he was \"disgusted\" by the performance. During an appearance on CNN later in the day, Costello stood by his tweet and clarified that he believed many moderate Republicans had made the right choice to distance themselves from Trump, who is deeply unpopular in some parts of the country. The President's unpopularity, Costello said, was a deciding factor in some of the races Republicans could have won but lost instead.\n\nTrump may not care much. Like so many other non-Trumpist Republicans, Costello is leaving Congress at the end of the year. He did not seek re-election.",
    " Title: Balancing Liberty and Law: A Historical Perspective on the Suspension of Habeas Corpus During Emergencies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn times of crisis, the delicate balance between liberty and law becomes a pressing issue, as society grapples with the need for security and the preservation of individual rights. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put this balance to the test, prompting a reexamination of historical precedents, particularly the suspension of habeas corpus during the American Civil War.\n\nThe current pandemic has placed a strain on the self-image of Americans as a free people, with the rule of law as our guiding principle. However, as the quote from Edmund Burke suggests, liberty and law are not mutually exclusive; they are interdependent, each requiring the other to function effectively.\n\nIn times of true security crises, such as war, natural disasters, or pandemics, the need for order and community often leads to the temporary restriction of individual liberties. This is not a sign of governmental tyranny, but rather a rational response to the desire for security.\n\nThe suspension of habeas corpus during the American Civil War, as exemplified by Abraham Lincoln's actions, serves as a case study in this dynamic. In 1861, Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, the right against arbitrary imprisonment, in response to the secessionist terrorism and the raging Civil War.\n\nThe Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Roger Taney, issued a writ of habeas corpus in favor of John Merryman, a Maryland militiaman detained by Union forces. Lincoln, in defiance of the court, questioned the notion that all laws should be upheld, even one, to prevent the collapse of the government.\n\nWhile the suspension of habeas corpus is often viewed as an unconstitutional act, it is essential to understand the historical context. The Constitution does not suspend during emergencies; rather, it provides for the restriction of some rights to enable the government to effectively confront emergency conditions.\n\nLincoln's suspension of a fundamental right was justified, as the survival of the United States was at stake. If the government had been unreasonably deferential to the right, all rights would have perished. There remains a strong argument that Lincoln did have the unilateral authority he claimed at the time.\n\nAs we navigate the current pandemic, it is crucial to remember two things. First, our natural inclination to prioritize security over liberty during emergencies makes us susceptible to overly draconian measures. While monitoring Japanese aliens or detaining some of them during World War II might have been sensible, the internment of American citizens of Japanese descent remains a dark stain on our history.\n\nSecond, in times of crisis, we tend to grant authorities a wide berth, sometimes too wide. True emergencies do not allow for extensive deliberations, and bad things happen. However, abuses are eventually addressed by courts and legislatures, albeit after the emergency has subsided.\n\nThe lesson from history is clear: we learn from our mistakes. The good news is that we do learn; the bad news is that we learn from our mistakes. As we continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to strike a balance between liberty and law, ensuring that restrictions are no more extensive than the threat reasonably demands.",
    " Title: Critique of President Obama's Oval Office Address: A Call for a New Direction in the War Against Terror\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic terrorist attack in San Bernardino, President Obama delivered an Oval Office address on Sunday night, a platform traditionally used to address significant national crises. However, the speech, according to critics, lacked the necessary decisive action and strategic direction to combat the growing threat of radical Islam.\n\nThe President could have used the opportunity to address the root causes of the attack, explain his plan to counter the ideology of radical Islam, and outline steps to prevent future attacks. Instead, the speech was criticized for shifting blame towards domestic opponents and proposing measures, such as gun control, that would not have prevented the San Bernardino attack.\n\nThe call for Congress to ban individuals on the no-fly list from purchasing firearms was seen as a diversionary tactic, with critics arguing that such measures would not have stopped the attack in San Bernardino. The President's moralizing about avoiding \"suspicion and hate\" was also criticized, with some interpreting it as an attempt to shift blame onto the American people, implying they are bigoted.\n\nThe President's reassurances about the fight against ISIS were met with skepticism, given the group's success in the face of a year and a half of U.S.-led war. The speech also drew criticism for the President's preemptive surrender to ISIS insurgents, despite the success of the 2007 surge in Iraq and the potential for a U.S.-led coalition to turn administration of Syria over to local tribes after destroying ISIS.\n\nThe speech was also criticized for the President's continued use of the term \"contained\" to describe ISIS, a characterization that is not shared by his own top general. The speech was seen as a missed opportunity for the President to outline a clear, decisive strategy to combat radical Islam and restore American leadership in the global fight against terror.\n\nAs the nation looks towards a new presidency, many are calling for a leader who can confidently explain a strategy to defeat ISIS, fight back in the cultural and ideological war radical Islam is waging against us, and defend rather than blame the American people. The office of the President awaits a new occupant who can restore America's alliances and lead the nation to victory in the war against terror.",
    " Title: OPM to Allow Federal Contribution to Congressional Healthcare Premiums under Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could be implemented as early as Friday, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is set to issue a ruling that will allow the government to continue contributing to the health care premiums of members of Congress and their staff, according to several Hill sources. This decision comes after heavy pressure from Capitol Hill and a potential impasse in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe issue stemmed from a provision in the original text of the ACA, inserted by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), which stated that members of Congress and their aides must be covered by plans \"created\" by the law or \"offered through an exchange.\" The OPM had not previously clarified whether the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program could contribute premium payments toward plans on the exchange. If payments stopped, lawmakers and aides would have faced thousands of dollars in additional premium payments each year. Under the old system, the government contributed nearly 75 percent of premium payments.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's involvement in finding a solution was unusual, but it came after serious concerns from both sides of the aisle about the potential for a \"brain drain.\" The fear, as told by sources in both parties, was that aides would leave for more lucrative jobs, spooked by the potential for spiking health premiums.\n\nThere was a sense of urgency, too, since enrollment in the exchanges was set to begin on October 1. Discussions of a legislative fix \u2013 attaching language to a must-pass bill to resolve the problem \u2013 were considered, but that would have been too difficult in today's paralyzed Washington.\n\nWhite House officials acknowledged that a fix was needed. However, they knew that once they dealt with it through a regulation, some Republicans would use it against them \u2013 even though most of their party was privately preoccupied with the issue.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement Thursday night, touting the law's benefits and Democrats' efforts to educate consumers. \"Members of Congress and their staffs must enroll in health marketplaces as the Affordable Care Act requires,\" she wrote. \"As we continue our work to ensure the smooth implementation of this law and look forward to the start of enrollment on October 1st, we will continue our efforts this August to educate consumers on the law's provisions and tout the critical benefits already in place for millions of Americans.\"\n\nAnger was also evident, with Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) tweeting a link to a news story Thursday night, commenting, \"Outrageous exemption for Congress.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Reach 41-Year Low, but Experts Warn of Potential Economic Bubble\n\n Article:\n\n In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. Department of Labor reported a drop in seasonally-adjusted initial unemployment claims to a 41-year low in the week ended July 18. However, this seemingly positive news is met with caution by Lee Adler, editor of The Wall Street Examiner newsletter.\n\n Adler argues that the jobless claim data might be stronger than it appears, as the mainstream media focuses on the seasonally-adjusted figures, which he believes are manipulated. \"The actual, not seasonally-finagled number has been at a record low relative to total employment since September 2013,\" Adler writes.\n\n Despite the record-low seasonally adjusted number, Adler points out that the current figures are well beyond the bubble record lows of 1999-2000 and 2006-07. He suggests that this could indicate a bubble of unprecedented proportions, recalling the stock market crashes in 2000-01 and 2008-09.\n\n Adler also notes that employers in some sectors are hoarding workers, a behavior that has been associated with economic bubbles in the past and has often led to massive retrenchment within 18 months.\n\n Meanwhile, on the equities front, U.S. stocks stand at historically high valuations, but valuations in foreign markets are much lower, making them attractive, according to MarketWatch columnist John Coumarianos. The S&P 500 index carried a trailing price-earnings ratio of 21.24 on July 17, up from 19.54 a year earlier. Robert Shiller's cyclically-adjusted price earnings ratio (CAPE) for the S&P 500, which includes 10 years of earnings, stands at 26.9.\n\n Coumarianos suggests that if the current level of U.S. stock prices is concerning, investors might find compelling investment bargains in other countries' markets. He cites data from Research Affiliates showing 24 markets that trade cheaper than the United States, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and India.\n\n Coumarianos expresses particular enthusiasm for British stocks, as the U.K.'s current CAPE of 12.4 is low compared to other countries and regions, and below its own median of 14.6 using data going back to 1969. He also notes that investors shouldn't have to worry too much about currency exposure to the pound.",
    " Title: \"Tom Perez's Unconventional Tactics: A New Era for the Democratic National Committee\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman, Tom Perez, is employing an unorthodox approach to rally support for the party, using anger and profanity in his speeches. This shift in strategy comes as the DNC grapples with the shock of Donald Trump's election and seeks to reconnect with voters beyond the coasts.\n\nPerez's fiery speeches, reminiscent of 20th-century dictators, have been met with mixed reactions. His latest statement, labeling Republicans as unconcerned about voters, has been followed by the release of a $30 T-shirt from the Democratic Party's official store, which reads, \"Democrats give a sh*t about People.\"\n\nThis new approach, while divisive, has sparked debate among political analysts. Some view it as a desperate attempt to gain traction in a polarized political climate, while others see it as a descent into base language and behavior.\n\nThe shift in tone and language is a stark contrast to the traditional, more refined approach to governance. The art of applying mission principles, seeking fiscal stability, and adhering to best practices has given way to a more primal notion that the loudest voice carries the most moral authority. Civility, once a hallmark of political discourse, is now perceived as weak and wimpy.\n\nThis change in political discourse has been attributed to various factors, including the influence of media seeking the lowest common denominator to increase ratings, the impact of technology, social media, and the internet, and the conduct of past presidents such as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nHowever, some scholars point to the philosophical movement of existentialism, particularly the works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre, as a significant influence. Existentialism's emphasis on subjective human judgment and the rejection of objective truth has been linked to the \"whatever\" culture, where personal satisfaction and self-indulgence are prioritized over objective standards.\n\nAs the DNC continues to navigate this new political landscape, the impact of Perez's unconventional tactics remains to be seen. One thing is certain, though: the Republican Party may find itself benefiting from this shift, as Perez's approach has sparked a renewed interest and energy within the GOP.",

The event, titled Women's March Youth EMPOWER, is inviting students, teachers, and parents to participate in a 17-minute walkout on March 14 at 10 a.m. One of the sites where a walkout is planned is Parkland, Florida, the location of the country's latest mass school shooting.\n\nThe Women's March Youth EMPOWER movement is urging students, teachers, and allies to take part in a #NationalSchoolWalkout for 17 minutes at 10 a.m. on March 14, 2018, as a show of solidarity and a call for action. The group's website states, \"We need action. Students and allies are organizing the national school walkout to demand Congress pass legislation to keep us safe from gun violence at our schools, on our streets and in our homes and places of worship.\"\n\nThe group emphasizes the right of students and staff to learn and teach in an environment free from the fear of gun violence, and the right of parents to send their children to school and expect them to return home safely. The movement's website further states, \"We are not safe at school. We are not safe in our cities and towns. Congress must take meaningful action to keep us safe and pass federal gun reform legislation that addresses the public health crisis of gun violence.\"\n\nAccording to the organizers' website, over two dozen walkouts are already planned across the country, with information available for other localities wishing to participate. The walkout event follows the deadly mass shooting on Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, which left 17 dead. The 19-year-old suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, reportedly claimed \"demon\" voices told him to carry out the violence, according to law enforcement sources.",
    " Title: Doubts Surround Legitimacy of Eastern Ukraine Referendums as Separatists Claim Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Sunday's referendums in eastern Ukraine, separatist groups have declared a landslide victory, claiming overwhelming support for independence from Kiev. However, the reported results and numerous irregularities observed by journalists have cast significant doubts on the legitimacy of a process that the interim President, Oleksandr Turchynov, has swiftly denounced.\n\nAccording to self-proclaimed electoral commissions in the regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, 96.2 percent and 89.07 percent of voters, respectively, favored self-rule. Separatists in both regions claimed a 75 percent turnout. However, these results are impossible to independently confirm, as no election monitors were allowed to observe voting.\n\nMultiple Western news outlets reported instances of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, as well as a general lack of understanding among voters about what they were opting for. CNN filmed several voters casting ballots repeatedly or even multiple ballots at one time. BBC reporters found multiple irregularities in the city of Mariupol, a city of half a million: only a handful of polling stations served Mariupol, anyone could vote in any polling station in the region simply by scribbling their name on a piece of paper, and one pro-Ukraine teacher said she received death threats after refusing to let rebels use her school as a polling station.\n\nThe BBC also notes that \"This was a vote that was organized, run, and then counted by the activists behind it.\" These incidents do not disprove the purported results, but they add credence to Turchynov's condemnation of the results. \"The farce, which terrorists call the referendum, will have no legal consequences except the criminal responsibility for its organizers,\" Mr. Turchynov said today, reports the Associated Press.\n\nThe European Union also criticized the vote, calling it illegal. The EU is expected to enact further sanctions against Russia today for its annexation in March of Crimea, Reuters reports. Russia, however, took a different tone. The Kremlin's press service said that \"Moscow respects the expression of will of the population of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions and proceeds on the basis that the implementation of the results of the referendums will be carried out in a civilized way,\" reports independent news service ITAR-TASS.\n\nRecent independent polling in eastern Ukraine sharply conflicts with the referendum results. A poll released last week by Pew Research found that 70 percent of respondents in the east \u2013 and 58 percent of Russian-speaking eastern respondents \u2013 wanted Ukraine to remain whole. Only 18 percent of easterners, and 27 percent of eastern Russian-speakers, said the eastern regions should be allowed to secede.\n\nThe Pew findings appear to roughly match an April poll on attitudes in southeastern Ukraine conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). Both found high dissatisfaction with Kiev's governance, but little appetite for outright independence.\n\nSunday's referendums only took place in the two easternmost regions of Ukraine. The two earlier polls considered attitudes in a much larger portion of eastern Ukraine \u2013 11 regions by Pew, eight by KIIS. However, for the referendum results to square with the earlier polls, support for secession would have to be minuscule outside of the Lugansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nEven among those who did vote on Sunday, there appeared to be confusion over just what they were voting for. The BBC's Sarah Rainford in Donetsk wrote that \"Some thought they were casting their ballot to join Russia, some people believed they were voting just to have more power in eastern Ukraine. Even the leaders of the referendum have different comments when you ask them what this is about.\"",
    " Title: Investigation into Alleged False Log Entries at New York Jail Facility Where Jeffrey Epstein Died\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his cell in a New York City jail facility on Saturday, a new report has emerged suggesting that guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center may have falsified log entries regarding checks on Epstein and other inmates.\n\nAccording to a report by the Associated Press on Tuesday, surveillance video reviewed after Epstein's death shows that guards at the facility did not make some of the checks they claimed to have made in their logs. A source told the Associated Press that the guards fell asleep at some point and did not check on Epstein for up to three hours.\n\nThe Justice Department has placed two guards assigned to watch Epstein on administrative leave, and the federal jail workers claimed they were checking on inmates in Epstein's unit every half hour, but investigators now believe that was not the case.\n\nThe latest revelation comes amid growing conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death as he awaited trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors said he sexually abused dozens of young girls in his New York and Florida residences between 2002 and 2005.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said Monday there were \"serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning,\" and he demanded \"a thorough investigation.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Epstein's apparent suicide, his alleged \"recruiter\" Ghislaine Maxwell now finds herself under the microscope. Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, has vowed to continue the investigation into Epstein, who was awaiting trial on allegations he operated an underage sex trafficking ring.\n\nSeveral of Epstein's accusers have pointed to Maxwell as playing a pivotal role in enlisting his victims, according to thousands of pages of court documents unsealed on Friday in relation to a 2015 defamation suit filed against Maxwell. Those who say they are victims of Epstein and other eyewitnesses to the events surrounding his alleged crimes have testified that Maxwell's role was in arranging massages and sexual favors for Epstein and a circle of his high-profile associates.\n\nHowever, Maxwell allegedly played an even more direct role in the sex abuse on several occasions. Maxwell and Epstein were accused of molesting two victims in 1996, but the claims, allegedly reported to the FBI, fell on deaf ears, according to an affidavit viewed by the Miami Herald. Maxwell has not released any public statements since Epstein's arrest in early July. No criminal charges have been brought against her, and she has consistently and vehemently denied all allegations of misconduct.",

Troops guarding the site have reportedly fled. The seizure comes as the country grapples with ongoing chaos, with AQAP overrunning Mukalla earlier this month and freeing inmates from a prison.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which has been bombing Shia Houthi rebels who have been advancing across the country, has not been able to prevent the takeover. The Houthis swept into the capital Sanaa last September, eventually forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nAQAP fighters have also reportedly taken control of a sea port and an oil terminal in southern Yemen. As the coalition strikes against the Houthis continue, Yemeni Vice-President Khaled Bahah has expressed his desire to avoid a Saudi-led ground offensive. \"We are still hoping that nothing will happen, and we are not expanding the war, but we are trying to stop the war,\" Mr. Bahah said.\n\nThe United Nations' special envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, has stepped down from his post. The UN has announced it will name a successor \"in due course\" and \"spare no efforts to relaunch the peace process.\" Mr. Benomar is believed to have come under pressure to resign from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states after failing to get the warring Yemeni factions to attend peace talks.\n\nThe Houthis, Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north, overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr. Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels.\n\nFormer President Ali Abdullah Saleh's military units, who were forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests, are fighting alongside the Houthis. President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, a US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states, says it is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" of Mr. Hadi. AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi. A rival affiliate of Islamic State has also recently emerged.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Challenges in Preventing Russian Election Interference Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With the 2018 midterm elections fast approaching, lawmakers are grappling with the issue of preventing Russian hacking of state election systems and the spread of disinformation via social media. However, Congress may be hindered by its reluctance to regulate private tech companies and states' traditional aversion to federal control over their elections, analysts say.\n\nThe three congressional committees conducting investigations into Russian meddling are no longer just trying to prevent Kremlin-linked groups from stealing campaign emails, as they allegedly did last year in cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Recent revelations about the extent of Russian efforts to spread disinformation via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites underscore the complexity of the challenge Congress faces as it heads toward the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"Congress may have begun its investigation looking for a nice, neat smoking keyboard,\" said Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"But this is not a case where you can call the vendor and get a patch to plug a security hole. This has become incredibly complicated.\"\n\nAdding to lawmakers' alarm, federal officials recently told election officials in 21 states that hackers possibly connected to Russia targeted their election systems last year. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee warned Wednesday that they expect the Russians to try again in the 2018 midterm elections, the 2020 presidential election, and possibly even this year in the Virginia governor's race.\n\n\"We need to be on guard,\" said Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va.\n\nThe biggest risk, analysts say, is not that the Russians will help one party's candidates defeat the other's but that they will succeed in causing Americans to doubt the legitimacy of election results.\n\n\"I don't think the Russians have a favorite political party,\" said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in California. \"They do have a preference for chaos and division.\"\n\nA report released in January by the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that Russia interfered in last year's election to boost Donald Trump and hurt Clinton.\n\n\"But their bigger goal is to disrupt the American political process and sow distrust and discontent,\" Herzik said.\n\nFacebook recently turned over more than 3,000 suspicious ads to the House Intelligence Committee. The ads were purchased by an organization that Facebook said was connected to Russian intelligence services during the 2016 election.\n\n\"These ads... help demonstrate how Russia employed sophisticated measures to push disinformation and propaganda to millions of Americans online during the election, in order to sow discord and chaos, and divide us from one another,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the committee's senior Democrat.\n\nThe House panel, along with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, is investigating Russian interference in last year's presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees are planning public hearings in the next few weeks with Facebook and other social media companies to examine how Russia exploited social media.\n\n\"If you see an ad on a social media site, Americans should know whether the source of that ad was a foreign entity,\" Warner told reporters. \"And if you see something trending, you should know whether that trending is generated by real individuals or bots or falsely identified accounts.\"\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Homeland Security committees, said that Russians have been weighing in on Twitter on both sides of the recent dispute between President Trump and the NFL over whether players should be fired for refusing to stand during the national anthem.\n\n\"We watched... the Russians and their troll farms and their Internet folks start hash-tagging out 'take a knee' and also hash-tagging out 'boycott NFL,'\" Lankford said at a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe Russians' goal, Lankford said, was \"to try to just raise the noise level in America and to make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they are trying to push divisiveness in the country.\"\n\n\"We will see that again in our election,\" he said.\n\nThere is little Congress can do to control what happens on social media other than push tech companies to better police themselves and identify who is buying ads or pushing out false information on their sites, Pitney said.\n\n\"It's a classic case of congressional pressure as a way of increasing self-regulation by the companies,\" the professor said. \"But it's probably impossible to stop this entirely.\"\n\nHenry Farrell, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said he is more concerned about Russian efforts to hack state elections' systems.\n\n\"I think the threat to election machines is substantially more significant,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers have been pressing the Department of Homeland Security about what federal officials are doing to prevent Russia or other foreign governments from hacking state election systems next year. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke told the Senate Homeland Security Committee recently that her agency has the resources it needs to do on-site assessments of election security for all the states that request it before the 2018 election.\n\n\"Not all states have requested it, and I think there is still an issue with some states on whether they want that federal involvement,\" Duke told the senators. \"But we do have the resources.\"\n\nStates pride themselves on local control of their election systems and say that one of the reasons it's hard to disrupt voting in the U.S. is because there is no central, national election database to hack.\n\n\"It may take a successful cyber attack against a state to change their view of federal help,\" Farrell said. \"But at the moment, it is very, very difficult politically for Congress to do much.\"",
    " Title: White House Faces Criticism Over President Obama's Actions Contradicting Fuel-Efficiency and Nutrition Initiatives\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's visit to a suburban Maryland distribution center on Tuesday to announce new fuel-efficiency standards for trucks was met with criticism, as the president's motorcade, consisting of 15 vehicles, traveled for an hour to deliver a 17-minute speech. This event, according to critics, is a reflection of a perceived disconnect between the president's words and actions.\n\nOver the weekend, the president faced criticism for golfing at some of California's most water-intensive golf courses, despite touring drought-stricken areas of the state and urging the Western U.S. to reconsider its water usage. Last week, the White House served a 2,500-calorie meal at a state dinner in honor of French President Francois Hollande, contradicting the first lady Michelle Obama's and the administration's focus on serving nutritious school meals.\n\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean, former chief of staff to Sen. Jon Kyl (AZ) and communications director to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (IL), commented, \"Obama is losing his connection to Americans who can't afford to take long and flashy vacations. He is talking the talk on fuel efficiency, but certainly isn't walking the walk. Instead, he's taking a gas-guzzling motorcade everywhere he goes.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski told Time over the weekend that the California golf outings, which followed a town hall meeting focused on the state's worsening water crisis, are the latest example of a \"brand of hypocrisy\" frequently exhibited by this White House.\n\nThe White House did not respond to The \u2588\u2588\u2588's request for comment regarding Tuesday's event. Time also reported that the administration declined to comment about the president's three rounds of golf while in California.\n\nAside from golf, fattening meals, and fuel-consuming trips on the Beltway, the administration has also faced hypocrisy charges on a more policy-oriented front. Republican lawmakers and other critics have charged that this president, after repeatedly criticizing his predecessor for frequent use of executive actions, has followed the same path.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Obama, in recent weeks, has boasted of how 2014 will be a \"year of action\" in which he'll work without Congress wherever possible, and denied that he is abusing executive authority. White House press secretary Jay Carney said last week that Mr. Obama has issued fewer executive orders than former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton did at this point in their presidencies.\n\nCritics charge it's not the number of actions, but rather the type and scope, with Mr. Obama frequently using his authority to change mandates and deadlines under Obamacare and in other areas. Brushing off the criticism, Mr. Obama continued his wave of executive actions.\n\nSpeaking at the Safeway distribution center, Mr. Obama announced a new round of fuel-economy goals the trucking industry must meet by 2025. Under current federal standards, medium and heavy-duty trucks must reduce their fuel consumption by 10 to 20 percent by 2018. The president's new proposal, which is not scheduled to be finalized until March 2016 near the end of his term, will set even more ambitious goals the trucking industry must achieve in the years after 2018.\n\n\"Improving gas mileage for these trucks is going to drive down our oil imports even further,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That reduces carbon pollution even more, cuts down on businesses' fuel costs, which should pay off in lower prices for consumers. So it's not just a win-win. It's a win-win-win.\"",
    " Title: McDonald's Wage Hike Affects Only Company-Owned Stores, NLRB Hearings Highlight Franchisee-Franchisor Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nMcDonald's announced on Wednesday that it would be raising the wages for tens of thousands of its workers nationwide. However, the company clarified that this high-profile wage hike would only apply to workers at the 10 percent of its stores that are company-owned. The remaining 90 percent of stores would not be affected, as reported yesterday by \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe company's press release emphasized that the more than 3,100 McDonald's franchisees operate their individual businesses and make their own decisions on pay and benefits for their employees. This statement underscores McDonald's distinction between itself and its franchisees, a distinction that is currently under scrutiny in a heated legal battle at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nThe NLRB is examining the very nature of McDonald's relationship with its franchisees, and the question of whether McDonald's is more than just a distant parent company to its franchisees is at the heart of this case. The outcome could have significant implications for franchises nationwide.\n\nFranchising is a mutually beneficial relationship, with the franchisee benefiting from the parent company's brand and well-known products, while also having the autonomy to make business decisions. In return, the franchisor can achieve rapid growth and increased revenues without managing the day-to-day operations of numerous smaller outlets. Both sides relinquish some control, with the franchisee following franchisor rules about what is served, while the franchisor allows the franchisee some independence in hiring, firing, and scheduling.\n\nHowever, the NLRB is questioning whether McDonald's is a \"joint employer\" alongside its franchisees. If McDonald's is deemed a joint employer, it would be required to share in the liability of labor law violations. In December, the NLRB issued complaints against the company, alleging, among other things, that it retaliated against workers who protested in favor of higher wages.\n\nThe NLRB's general counsel, Richard Griffin, is arguing that if McDonald's has enough control over its restaurants, it should be considered a joint employer. Griffin has also advocated for a broader definition of what it means to be a joint employer. Some argue that McDonald's rules governing day-to-day operations, from the use of scheduling software to bag folding, indicate that the company is as much an employer to its workers as franchisees are.\n\nIf a franchisor is not considered a joint employer, it would not be involved in issues like negotiating with unions or setting the pay of workers. As it stands, the decision to boost pay could put franchisees in a difficult position, as they may feel pressure to raise their own wages but may not have the financial means to do so.\n\nThe question of who is a joint employer is not just about franchisors and franchisees. It is a central issue in the US labor market, with the question of the \"fissured workplace\" becoming increasingly relevant. David Weil, now the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor, argued in a 2014 book that businesses distancing themselves from workers through means like subcontractors and temp agencies has led to lower wages, worse benefits, and growing inequality.\n\nIn addition to the McDonald's cases, the NLRB has yet to rule on another high-stakes case involving waste management firm Browning Ferris. The question in this case is whether Browning Ferris is a joint employer and therefore has to negotiate with unionized workers at a subcontractor. In this and the McDonald's case, the broader question of what it means to be an employer is at stake.\n\nAs attorney Michael Lotito told me in December, this could have \"cataclysmic\" effects on the nearly 9 million US workers who work in franchises, not to mention the relationship between contractors and subcontractors and even between businesses and their suppliers. \"It has a way of upsetting these business relationships and employers thinking they were separate suddenly finding they are combined,\" he said. \"That has just enormous implications for business relationships.\"",
    " Title: White, College-Educated Workers' Struggles in a Capitalist Democracy: A Father's Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heartfelt conversation, a white, college-educated father expresses his disdain not towards racial or immigration issues, but the recent royal wedding, which he perceives as a symbol of an unfair power structure. This father, who has faced financial struggles, yearns for a society where everyone, including his own son, can have basic necessities such as a home, chickens, a garden, and leisure activities.\n\nThe father, who has worked tirelessly in Marion, Arkansas, has been affected by the Great Recession, selling his plasma for gas money and being laid off in 2008. He had to cash in his retirement to make ends meet while searching for another job. Despite his college education, he has no savings beyond Social Security.\n\nHis anger is not directed at his co-workers, Gem, a Filipino immigrant, or Francisco, a Hispanic crew member, with whom he shares a room to save on per diem expenses, or with whom he recently built a Wendy's north of Memphis. Instead, his anger is aimed at employers who exploit labor and governments that, in his view, punish the working poor, two sides of a capitalist democracy that he feels drains people like him.\n\n\"Corporations,\" he said, \"that's it. That's the point of the sword that's killing us.\"\n\nThis father's negative energy is a reflection of a broader sentiment among white workers, which has been effectively manipulated by a conservative trio in media, private interest, and celebrity, often associated with Fox, Koch, and Trump. This trio has capitalized on this negative energy to significant political effect.",
    " Title: U.S. Adopts \"Liberal Approach\" in Recording COVID-19 Deaths, According to Dr. Deborah Birx\n\nIn a recent White House briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the coronavirus task force, confirmed that the United States has adopted a \"liberal approach\" in recording deaths related to the virus. This approach means that any death of a person infected with COVID-19, regardless of underlying conditions, is classified as a COVID-19 death.\n\nDuring the briefing, Dr. Birx stated, \"The intent is right now if someone dies with COVID-19, we're counting that as a COVID-19 death. There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition and let's say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem, some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.\"\n\nThis \"liberal approach to mortality\" has been a topic of discussion among experts and media personalities. For instance, Tucker Carlson suggested that doctors might be classifying conventional pneumonia deaths as COVID-19 deaths, which could inflate the number of deaths attributed to the virus.\n\nThe way COVID-19 deaths are counted is significant, as the \"lethality\" of the virus has been a major factor in the countrywide economic shutdown. The latest numbers compiled under this classification by Johns Hopkins University show 398,185 positive diagnoses, 21,849 recoveries, and 12,844 deaths.\n\nThis revelation sheds light on the methodology used to count COVID-19 deaths in the United States, providing clarity on a topic that has been a subject of debate in recent months.",

    " Title: Google Employee Files Lawsuit Alleging Discrimination Against Conservative, Caucasian, and Male Employees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in Santa Clara Superior Court on Monday, former Google engineer James Damore, who was terminated in August for circulating a controversial memo about gender and diversity, alleged that the tech giant discriminates against politically conservative white men. Damore, along with another plaintiff, David Gudeman, another former Google engineer, are seeking class-action status for anyone who identifies as conservative, Caucasian, or male.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Google \"singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated\" employees who deviated from the company's view on diversity. The suit reads, \"Google's management goes to extreme \u2014 and illegal \u2014 lengths to encourage hiring managers to take protected categories such as race and/or gender into consideration as determinative hiring factors, to the detriment of Caucasian and male employees and potential employees at Google.\"\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges that Google employs illegal hiring quotas to fill its desired percentages of women and favored minority candidates, and openly shames managers of business units who fail to meet their quotas. The suit also claims that the numerical presence of women was celebrated at Google solely due to their gender, while the presence of Caucasians and males was mocked during company-wide weekly meetings.\n\nDamore's lawsuit is the latest legal challenge for Google, which also faces a suit for unequal pay. Earlier this month, four women plaintiffs alleged that the company had underpaid them compared to their male counterparts. Damore's suit, which comes from the opposite end of the spectrum, was expected given his public hiring of Harmeet K. Dhillon, the Republican National Committee's committeewoman for California, in August.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Damore, who received eight performance bonuses and $150,000 per year in stock bonuses since he started working at Google in the summer of 2013, was terminated after voicing his complaints about diversity practices and publishing his now-infamous 10-page memo, titled \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.\"\n\nDamore also claims that he was forced to attend and participate in diversity training events and was threatened and insulted by his coworkers following the publishing of his memo. The lawsuit alleges the presence of a \"blacklist\" that highlights employees with conservative views and prevents them from receiving certain jobs or promotions. The suit also alleges that the company maintains separate lists of conservative personalities, including right-wing blogger Curtis Yarvin and InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to prevent them from stepping foot on Google's campus.\n\nSince being terminated from Google, Damore has remained unemployed, noting in his suit that management did not identify \"any Google policy or procedure that Damore had violated.\" Damore has made a slew of media appearances, started a Twitter account, and met with conservative media and political figures, including Peter Thiel, according to several sources.\n\nAt a press conference on Monday at Dhillon's San Francisco office, Damore expressed a desire to return to Google and improve things there. Gudeman, the other named plaintiff, did not attend the event. Gudeman, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked at Google as an engineer from November 2013 to December 2016. He is currently a self-employed software contractor and writer.\n\nDhillon spoke for much of the event as her client watched silently and chimed in only when questions were directed his way. She stressed that the suit was an employment one, and not about free speech, and that while she had had \"dozens\" of people contact her about their experiences at Google, only Damore and Gudeman were willing to be named due to fear of reprisal. With plenty of cameras rolling, Dhillon hit familiar right-wing talking points, from the virtue signaling of Hollywood and Oprah to Silicon Valley's supposedly higher tolerance for \"furry sex parties\" than conservative views, to establish that Damore's firing had been politically motivated. And Damore, she said, was not the only one to experience this at Google. Others \"wanted to put names, but there is a specific blacklisting of conservatives,\" Dhillon said. \"Nobody wants to be a martyr and nobody wants to do this to help others unless they have to do it. That\u2019s why James is here.\" Joseph Bernstein contributed additional reporting to this story.",
    " Title: China Warns of Permanent Loss of U.S. Agricultural Market Share Amid Escalating Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with the state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday, China's Vice Agriculture Minister Han Jun warned that the U.S. could permanently lose its share of the Chinese agricultural market due to the ongoing trade war. Han stated that other countries have the willingness and capacity to take over the market share currently held by U.S. farmers.\n\nHan warned that American farmers could lose the position they have spent several decades building in the Chinese market due to retaliatory tariffs. He noted that Beijing has imposed duties on 90% of agricultural goods imported from the United States since the trade war began last month, with limited impact on China.\n\nChina and the U.S. have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war since early last month, with Beijing announcing retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion of American goods on Wednesday, matching Washington's move to impose 25% duties on the same value of Chinese imports.\n\nHan also stated that Chinese companies had \"basically stopped\" importing soybeans from U.S. farmers since July 6, and would deal with the impact by finding alternative ingredients for animal feed. China is the world's largest importer of soybeans, using them to make cooking oil, biodiesel, and livestock feed.\n\nHan predicted that China's soybean imports from the U.S. would drop dramatically this year, and that the country was already prepared to handle the shortfall. He also noted that China had been buying more soybeans from other countries and promoting alternatives to soybeans for livestock feed, as well as encouraging domestic crop production.\n\nBefore the trade war, China was on track to import 300 million tons of soybeans from the United States this year. In 2017, China imported about $24.1 billion of agricultural products from the United States, accounting for 19% of its total farm imports worth some $125.86 billion, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n\nHan also stated that Beijing had imposed 25% tariffs on 517 types of American agricultural products, including nuts, soybeans, cotton, fruit, and meat, with a combined value of around $21 billion last year. He warned that additional duties on American agricultural goods were in the pipeline.\n\nBeijing has said it is ready to impose tariffs on $60 billion of American products if President Donald Trump goes ahead with plans to impose additional duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods. The next list will include 387 types of agricultural products, including coffee, vegetables, and vegetable oils, which last year had a total value of around $2.9 billion.\n\nHan admitted that Washington's tariffs would impact China's fruit, vegetable, and seafood producers because it would not be easy for them to find alternative export destinations in the short term. He stated that Beijing would help exporters find other countries to sell their products to and try to boost domestic consumption instead, to minimize the impact of the tariffs.\n\nThe United States was the third-largest market for Chinese fruit and the fifth-largest for vegetables last year, with exports valued at a combined $1.84 billion. Han also noted that the European Union would not be able to make up the losses for U.S. soybean producers, who will be left with a huge surplus without China buying the grain from them. He stated that although the EU had agreed to import more soybeans from America, it would only buy 13 million to 14 million tons of soybeans a year over the next decade, compared with the more than 30 million tons of the grain China bought from the U.S. last year.",
    " Title: California's Poverty Reduction Efforts: A Closer Look at Occupational Licensing and the \"Dignity of Work\"\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, known for its progressive policies and generous social welfare programs, is grappling with the issue of poverty, despite being the most politically progressive state in America. A recent report by The American Prospect suggests that the state might be on the verge of eliminating childhood deep poverty, but a state labor official offers a different perspective.\n\nBarry Broad, who heads the California Employment Training Panel, questions the idea of Universal Basic Income, a pilot program being implemented in one of California's poorest cities, Stockton. Broad argues that the concept of Universal Basic Income is a surrender to a \"grim Dickensian view of the future,\" robbing people of the dignity of work.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in California's occupational licensing rules. The state imposes stringent regulations on various trades, making it difficult for low-income Californians to pursue lucrative careers. For instance, a bill introduced last year to eliminate the 1,500 hours of schooling required to shampoo and curl people's hair for pay was met with resistance and ultimately died in the Assembly.\n\nThe average cost of a license is $500, but the myriad training rules are the main problem. These rules are often not about promoting public safety but protecting existing industries from competition. Lawmakers are hesitant to take on existing interest groups, and rolling back government regulations is a challenging task.\n\nIn contrast, conservative-leaning Arizona is reforming such laws. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey recently signed a measure that recognizes new residents' licenses from other states. California, however, is unlikely to approve such a reform.\n\nCalifornia has attempted to address the licensing issue, albeit in a perverse way. Last year, Attorney General Xavier Becerra sponsored a bill to help law enforcement arrest people who buy or sell services in the \"underground economy.\" Fortunately, Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it. The state also announced sting operations to catch laborers who have exceeded the $500 cap on providing unlicensed contracting.\n\nInstead of reforming its rules, California officials hope to fine and jail people. Backers of such work argue that it results in \"significant uncollected revenues,\" which are needed to fund anti-poverty programs. However, the question remains: could the best way to eliminate poverty be to make it easier for people to legally pursue dignified work?\n\nThis column was first published in the Orange County Register.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway Suggests Undercover Voters Could Influence Election Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nKellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, has suggested that the Republican nominee could win the November elections due to a cohort of \"undercover voters\" who are not accurately reflected in current polls. In an interview with Channel 4 for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win?, Conway outlined her vision of how these unseen supporters could swing the election in Trump's favor.\n\nConway argued that the perceived social stigma of supporting Trump is causing his support to be underrepresented in polls. She stated, \"Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections... it's become socially desirable, especially if you're a college-educated person in the US, to say that you're against Donald Trump.\"\n\nConway also suggested that these undercover voters are individuals who have not traditionally voted Republican or have abstained from voting in the past. She explained, \"People who are supporting Donald Trump, who have not voted Republican in the past, who have not voted in quite a while, are so tired of arguing with family and friends and colleagues about their support of Donald Trump that they just decided not to discuss it.\"\n\nConway's argument echoes the Bradley effect, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters that they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth. Named for former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, the Bradley effect was most prominent in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn an attempt to reach these undercover voters, Conway stated that her method is \"proprietary\" and that they are reached \"in many different ways\" and \"go to them where they live, literally.\"\n\nTrump's adoption of teleprompters at rallies, a shift from his previous unscripted style, came as Conway took control of the campaign. Despite this change, Trump still veered off script in a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night, stating, \"You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\"\n\nAs the election approaches, it remains to be seen whether Conway's undercover voter theory will hold true, or if Trump's controversial statements will continue to overshadow his campaign.",
    " Title: ISIS Claims Responsibility for Texas Cartoon Contest Shooting, U.S. Authorities Investigate Terror Links\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting outside a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, warning of further attacks to come. The group made the claim in a broadcast on its official radio channel Tuesday, referring to the gunmen as two of its soldiers.\n\nThe attack took place in Garland, a Dallas suburb, where two gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, wounded a security guard before being shot and killed by police. The ISIS radio announcer referred to Simpson and Soofi as the terror group's \"brothers.\"\n\nWhile ISIS claimed responsibility two days after the attack, there was no immediate indication that the terror group in Iraq and Syria had contact with Simpson or Soofi, who both lived in Phoenix. Clemente, a terrorism expert, suggested that the gunmen may have been self-radicalized and sympathizers of ISIS, rather than being directly directed by the terror group.\n\nU.S. authorities are still investigating any links between Sunday's shooters and international terrorism. Moments before the attack, Simpson posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack, saying \"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\" The tweet also pledged allegiance to \"Amirul Mu'mineen,\" which likely refers to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nSimpson had also asked his followers on Twitter to follow an ISIS propagandist, and after the shooting, the propagandist tweeted \"Allahu Akbar!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire.\"\n\nThe shooting fits a well-known pattern of ISIS recruitment and incitement, encouraging sympathizers via a sophisticated social media campaign to join the fight in Syria or, if they can't, to carry out terror attacks on their own at home.\n\nSimpson was previously convicted of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism in 2011. He was sentenced to three years of probation. Soofi, on the other hand, was relatively unknown to federal investigators.\n\nAuthorities knew of no indication the pair planned to launch Sunday's attack, and it is still unclear when the trip from Phoenix to Garland was made. The FBI is currently analyzing a hard drive retrieved from the gunmen's apartment and interviewing friends in an attempt to draw possible connections.\n\nThe shooting has stirred memories of other attacks this year in France and Denmark, including the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo and a free speech forum featuring artist Lars Vilks. The American Freedom Defense Initiative was hosting the cartoon contest featuring depictions of the Prophet Mohammed inside the city's Curtis Culwell Center. The two assailants drove up to the center and started shooting, striking a security guard in the ankle before being shot and killed by police.",
    " Title: Former Bolton Aide Declines to Testify in Impeachment Inquiry, Citing Legal Tug-of-War\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, a top aide to former White House national security adviser John Bolton has declined to testify before Congress on Monday. Charles Cooper, the attorney for former Bolton aide Charles Kupperman, stated in a letter delivered Sunday to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee that Kupperman will not testify until a court rules on a lawsuit surrounding his appearance.\n\nKupperman, the former deputy to Bolton, has been caught in a legal tug-of-war between a White House trying to block his testimony, citing executive privilege, and Democrats who have subpoenaed Kupperman to appear on Monday in the Capitol before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe.\n\nOn Friday, Kupperman filed a lawsuit, essentially asking the courts to rule on which side had the more compelling legal argument. In response, Democrats on the three committees fired back on Saturday, warning that Kupperman\u2014now a private citizen\u2014has a legal obligation to appear before Congress. A failure to do so, the committee chairs warned, could lead to charges of contempt of Congress.\n\nIn his letter to Daniel Noble, a Democratic attorney for the committee, Cooper wrote, \"If your clients' position on the merits of this issue is correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the Court's judgment.\"\n\nThe deposition of Kupperman, who was reportedly on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment investigation, was scheduled for Monday. However, his absence could now be seen as evidence in a potential contempt of Congress proceeding.\n\nThe concept of \"immunity\" of top presidential advisers from congressional testimony has been invoked by both Republican and Democratic administrations, but there is little case law on the subject. The White House successfully blocked former White House counsel Don McGahn from appearing before Congress pursuant to a subpoena earlier this year by asserting he is immune from compelled testimony. The developments have prompted a court fight.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Oversight and Reform Committee acting Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) have stated that Kupperman remains legally obligated to appear for the deposition on Monday, should he defy the subpoena.\n\nSchiff said Sunday that Bolton is also a \"very important\" witness, and House Democrats want him to testify. However, he anticipates another standoff with the White House. \"My guess is they're going to fight us having John Bolton in,\" Schiff said on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
    " Title: Iraqi Prime Minister Vows to Oppose Successor Nomination as Political Tensions Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nIraq's political landscape is experiencing a significant shift as the incumbent Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has vowed to resist the nomination of his successor, Haider al-Abadi. Al-Abadi, currently the deputy speaker of Parliament, is working to form a new government, with the backing of the United States.\n\nThe United States has publicly endorsed al-Abadi, with President Barack Obama describing his nomination as a \"promising step forward.\" Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have expressed their support for the new prime minister-designate.\n\nThe Obama administration is also promising additional financial and military support to Iraq in its fight against the Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Iraq. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the United States \"stands ready to fully support a new inclusive Iraqi government.\"\n\nThe political power struggle reached a critical point on Monday when President Fuad Masum named al-Abadi to replace al-Maliki. Al-Maliki, however, has been defiant, vowing to fight al-Abadi's nomination.\n\nAl-Maliki could attempt to obstruct the political process to prevent al-Abadi from forming a government within the 30-day time frame outlined in Iraq's Constitution. However, officials believe he may not have enough backing to do so, as a large portion of the Shia bloc, including most of his own party, supports al-Abadi.\n\nThe United States has increased military aid to al-Maliki's government over the past year to combat IS militants, who have made sweeping gains in northern Iraq in a brutal campaign. Last week, Obama ordered airstrikes against IS positions and humanitarian airdrops to aid thousands of the Yazidi minority under threat from the extremist group and trapped in the Sinjar Mountains.\n\nThe United States is also covertly arming Kurdish Peshmerga forces battling IS. Kerry noted that the aid is \"very much calculated to try to stabilize the security situation, expand economic development, and strengthen the democratic institutions.\"\n\nThe United States has been encouraged by the unprecedented cooperation between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in fighting IS and aiding civilians in the north. This cooperation gives officials hope that Iraq's long-divided ethnic groups are finally uniting in response to the Islamic State threat.\n\nHowever, the United States risks fueling Iraq's sectarian divide with its military support. With additional backing for a new Iraqi Shia-led government and its direct support for the Kurds, the United States risks pushing Iraq's Sunni population toward IS, which is also Sunni, as they will see this support as taking sides in what is widely viewed as a civil war.\n\nHaider al-Abadi, a Shia from the same party as al-Maliki, may not be a transformational figure, but the United States has been impressed with his political stand against al-Maliki and his ability to accumulate support from the Shia.\n\nThe success of al-Abadi's government will depend on his ability to unite the country and fight off the Islamic State advance. Kurt Sowell, editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, stated, \"Abadi has never been involved in personal controversy. He is someone who really has tried to tow a straight line. I think he is someone who will try to be inclusive and work with people. But at the same time, he's never been someone to push for reform.\"\n\nIf al-Maliki is able to prevent al-Abadi from forming a government, Iraqi politicians would be back to square one, and the United States would be forced to choose between supporting al-Maliki's caretaker government or waiting for a new prime minister to be designated who can form a government. If IS continues to advance, neither Iraq nor the United States will have the luxury of time.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Elizabeth Warren of Affecting Bernie Sanders' Presidential Campaign Performance on Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump claimed that Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., single-handedly affected the performance of Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the Super Tuesday primaries, suggesting that if Warren had dropped out of the race three days earlier, Sanders could have won more contests.\n\n\"Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning. \"He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier.\"\n\nThe President added, \"The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?\"\n\nSenator Sanders, known for his fiery campaign style and disdain for the party establishment, has directed his ire toward former Vice President Joe Biden and the powerbrokers rallying behind him following his Super Tuesday wins that placed him in a delegate lead.\n\nWarren, who dropped out of the presidential race last week after the delegate-rich Super Tuesday primaries, has not yet endorsed either Biden or Sanders.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Sanders won four races, including California, his home state of Vermont, Utah, and Colorado, while Biden won 10 primaries, including the final primary of the early nominating calendar - South Carolina - giving him a much-needed boost ahead of Super Tuesday.\n\nSenator Warren had a poor showing on Super Tuesday, coming in third place in her home state of Massachusetts. Upon suspending her campaign, Warren, unlike other former 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, did not endorse anyone. Warren has been considered closer to Sanders ideologically, but the two have clashed in recent weeks. It remains unclear whether Warren is leaning toward endorsing one candidate or the other.\n\nBiden has since received endorsements from Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Warren, in her farewell speech, addressed \"sexism\" in the race and promised she'd have \"more to say\" later.",
    " Title: White House Blocks Release of Democratic Counter-Memo on Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - President Donald Trump on Friday blocked the release of a counter-memo written by congressional Democrats to rebut a Republican document that he allowed to be made public last week, which claimed FBI and Justice Department bias against him in the federal probe of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe Republican president's decision, the latest controversy relating to an investigation that has hung over his year in office, infuriated Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said, \"Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: what is he hiding?\"\n\nWhite House Counsel Don McGahn said the Justice Department had identified portions of the 10-page memo written by Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee that \"would create especially significant concerns for the national security and law enforcement interests\" of the country.\n\nThe White House also released a letter from the FBI director and the department's No. 2 official voicing concern about its release in relation to protecting U.S. intelligence sources and methods.\n\nA week earlier, Trump had overruled similar objections from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department about releasing the memo written by the same committee's Republican members that took aim at senior law enforcement officials.\n\n\"The president's double standard when it comes to transparency is appalling,\" Schumer said. Trump on Feb. 2 allowed the release of the memo written by the committee's Republicans with no redactions. Democrats said the Republican memo mischaracterized highly sensitive classified information and was intended to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nMueller is also investigating whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice in trying to impede the Russia probe.\n\nMcGahn said the president would be willing to reconsider the release of the memo if the committee decides to revise it \"to mitigate the risks\" identified by the Justice Department.\n\nThe committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, said the memo Trump blocked puts forth facts that the public needs to know, including that the FBI acted properly in seeking permission from a special court for surveillance of Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser with ties to Russia.\n\nSchiff said the committee's Democrats \"take seriously\" the Justice Department and FBI concerns and will review their recommended redactions. He said he hopes the matter can be resolved quickly so the committee can return to the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee voted unanimously on Monday to release the document drafted by the panel's Democrats, contingent on the Republican president agreeing to reclassify it.\n\n\"Although the President is inclined to declassify the Feb. 5 Memorandum, because the memorandum contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages, he is unable to do so at this time,\" McGahn said in a letter to Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House panel.\n\nThe White House also released a letter sent to McGahn by FBI Director Christopher Wray and to Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, expressing concerns about the memo's release \"in light of longstanding principles regarding the protection of intelligence sources and methods, ongoing investigations, and other similar sensitive information.\"\n\nDemocratic Representative Ted Lieu wrote on Twitter that Trump's action was outrageous, adding that he read the memo and is convinced that Trump \"is now intentionally hiding relevant information from the American people in order to mislead the public.\"\n\nThe Republican memo portrayed the Russia investigation as a product of political bias at the FBI and Justice Department against Trump. The president said the document \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russia investigation, a claim disputed by Democrats and some Republicans.\n\nDemocrats last week warned Trump against using the Republican memo as a pretext to fire Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or to remove Mueller himself. The Republican memo singled out Rosenstein and several other officials by name, including former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired in May 2017, as the agency investigated the Russia matter.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign using hacking and propaganda, an effort that eventually included attempting to tilt the race in Trump's favor. Russia denies interfering in the election. Trump denies collusion with Moscow.",
    " Title: U.S. Surpasses China as Hardest-Hit Country by Coronavirus, President Trump Discusses Testing and Death Rates\n\nThe United States has surpassed China as the hardest-hit country by the global coronavirus pandemic, with over 82,285 confirmed cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Worldometer. President Donald Trump addressed the daily briefing of the coronavirus task force, stating, \"We're testing a tremendous number of people.\"\n\nWhile the data milestone may be a potential mark against the U.S. response to the pandemic, it does show that the U.S. has been conducting more tests than any country in the world. Vice President Mike Pence announced that more than 552,000 tests have been conducted in the U.S. to date. The rate of positives for every coronavirus test administered is 14.9%, although that includes some people who have had the virus and needed subsequent tests to be cleared of infection.\n\nThe U.S. death total of 1,177 is the sixth-highest in the world, suggesting the U.S. healthcare system is helping keep Americans alive at a higher rate than European countries. The U.S. confirmed-case death rate is just 1.4%, while the other most-infected countries are far less effective in keeping their infected citizens alive.\n\nAt the White House task force's daily news conference on Thursday, officials identified Chicago and Detroit areas as potential new hot spots for the virus in the U.S. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus response, told reporters that officials are concerned about rapid increases in cases in Cook County, Ill., and Wayne County, Mich. The two counties encapsulate the cities and surrounding communities of Chicago and Detroit, respectively.\n\nThe Seattle area, where many early cases centered around an adult care facility, also remains a hot spot. Rising fast in infections is New Orleans, in part because of last month's Carnival festivities there offering a ripe opportunity for the virus to spread widely. New Orleans has the world's highest growth rate for virus cases, with the metro area accounting for some 70% of the roughly 1,800 cases in Louisiana.\n\nU.S. Army leaders said Thursday that two field hospitals are on their way to New York City and will be able to begin treating patients at the Javits Center on Monday. The Army combat units from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, will include as many as 700 personnel and almost 300 beds. Those medical personnel will also be able to help staff additional beds and medical equipment that are being brought in by state and local authorities.\n\nAn Army combat hospital from Fort Carson, Colorado, will also be heading to Seattle. McConville said advance staff are already there, and are working with local officials to review several potential locations to set up the unit.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",
    " Title: U.S. Senate Negotiators Make Progress on Immigration Overhaul, but Remain Divided on Visa Program and Path to Citizenship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over U.S. immigration policy, a significant development has emerged as a bipartisan group of eight senators continues to make progress towards an overall deal. The focus of the negotiations remains on addressing the need for a system that caters to businesses' demand for lower-skilled labor while safeguarding American workers.\n\nOne of the main points of contention is the visa program for year-round, temporary workers. In February, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reached a compromise, acknowledging the need for a system that balances business demands with worker protection. However, the two groups remain divided on the number of visas the new program should offer.\n\nRandel K. Johnson, the chamber's lead negotiator on immigration, stated that the chamber seeks 400,000 visas, while the A.F.L.-C.I.O. prefers a number in the \"very, very low five figures.\" Ana Avenda\u00f1o, the director of immigration for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., declined to discuss a specific number but emphasized the need for a system that responds to economic needs.\n\nAnother contentious issue is the improvement of E-Verify, the system employers use to check the immigration status of their workers. The group is considering an enhanced E-Verify system that would allow employers to use photographs to identify job applicants and would let workers provide answers to security questions to help prove their legal work status. A high-tech, biometric identification card was deemed too costly.\n\nDespite the remaining differences, the eight senators in negotiations are reportedly making steady progress. President Obama, who has threatened to push forward with his own legislation if Senate efforts stall, is satisfied with the current pace of talks, according to White House officials.\n\nHowever, even if the Senate passes an immigration overhaul later this spring or summer, it still faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House. A group of House Republicans has indicated that they are close to releasing a set of principles to guide their own legislation.\n\nHouse Republicans prefer to tackle an immigration overhaul in several smaller bills rather than one comprehensive bill. Additionally, many House Republicans want to offer illegal immigrants a legal status that falls short of a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe most evident momentum appears to be in the progress among senators on the path to citizenship. The question of whether and how illegal immigrants eventually become citizens has been the most contentious aspect of the immigration debate over the years.",
    " Title: Trump Kicks Off 2020 Presidential Re-election Campaign in Orlando, Florida\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated event on Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump officially commenced his 2020 re-election campaign in Orlando, Florida. The event, held in a 20,000-seat arena, served as a trial run for Trump's pitch to the American people for another four years, showcasing his policies, achievements, and the connection he maintains with his supporters.\n\nTrump's speech, lasting 78 minutes, was a mix of economic boasts, policy discussions, and a strong emphasis on his attitude and ability to connect with his supporters. The American economy, regulation-cutting, military spending, trade negotiations, tax reform, border security, and judicial appointments were among the topics discussed, all of which received a warm response from the audience.\n\nRobert Adamson, an insurance salesman from Merritt Island, Florida, expressed his support for Trump, stating, \"This is the only platform he really gets where he gets a fair shake at being able to divulge his achievements.\"\n\nThe Trump phenomenon extends beyond policies, as Vice-President Mike Pence noted in his introductory speech. Trump's success is rooted in his attitude and his ability to make his supporters feel a part of his movement. Paul Barka, a maintenance worker for a college in Tampa, Florida, echoed this sentiment, saying, \"He doesn't talk like a polished politician. It doesn't matter if he comes across as being rash or harsh or even ignorant at times.\"\n\nThe president also polled the audience on whether he should keep \"Make America Great Again\" as his 2020 campaign slogan or opt for \"Keep America Great.\" The audience's response to the latter option was deafening, surprising even Trump himself.\n\nThe president's re-election campaign is expected to focus on vindication, as indicated by the themes presented in the Orlando rally. Trump framed this vindication as a victory for his supporters, reminding them that they were once labeled \"deplorables\" by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe president also made dark warnings of what could happen if Democrats defeat him in 2020, stating, \"They are trying to erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of the country.\"\n\nOutside the arena, a handful of anti-Trump protesters voiced their opposition, but inside, the president's base showed their support, with enthusiasm for his rhetoric and pugilistic attitude remaining strong despite polls indicating an uphill road ahead for the president. The 2020 election could come down to a battle of turnout and passion, fueled by equal parts dedication to the cause and antipathy toward the opposition.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Increased Tariffs on Chinese Imports: A Shift in U.S.-China Trade Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the U.S. will impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports, signaling a shift in the ongoing trade negotiations between the two economic powerhouses. Trump's decision underscores the end of an era where China could negotiate with weak counterparts, as he aims to protect U.S. national security and economy in the long term.\n\nThe new tariffs, effective this Friday, will increase the rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. This will result in a 25 percent tariff rate on a combined total of $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, representing 46 percent of the $540 billion in goods imported from China in 2018. Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on the remaining half of imports yet to face higher levies.\n\nChina's ability to retaliate is limited due to the lopsided nature of the trade relationship, with the U.S. exporting only $120 billion in goods to China last year, less than a quarter of what was imported. The Trump administration's move comes as China is reportedly stalling in trade talks, a pattern that has been ingrained over decades, with Chinese negotiators expecting American negotiators to cave in on contentious points.\n\nRecent comments by former Vice President Joe Biden, who described China as \"not competition for us\" and \"not bad folks,\" have been criticized by the Trump administration. Trump's team is negotiating on a range of issues, including cyber intrusions, market-distorting subsidies, state-owned enterprises, forced transfer of U.S. business technology, intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and the export of deadly fentanyl.\n\nThe Trump administration is also aware of China's history of violating agreements, citing examples such as China's reneging on promises not to militarize the South China Sea and to stop cyber attacks against the U.S., as well as its broken promises to Great Britain regarding the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong.\n\nTrump's negotiators have insisted that U.S. tariffs remain on Chinese goods until China demonstrates changed behavior, not just promises of change. This approach has been a sticking point in talks with China's diplomats, who are accustomed to western leaders accepting a deal for the photo opportunity it produces, and then overlooking Chinese noncompliance.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated last week that the trade team would soon \"either recommend to the president we have a deal or make a recommendation that we don't.\" With Chinese intransigence and duplicity, it appears that the latter conclusion may be the outcome. Rather than caving in or walking away, Trump has increased the pressure on China with the new tariffs, giving Beijing another chance to understand that the old days are over for good. Either China shapes up or faces the consequences of more economic pain, as it contributes to the U.S. Treasury through higher tariffs.\n\nChristian Whiton, a senior advisor in the Donald Trump and George W. Bush administrations, commented on the situation, stating, \"Trump is well aware of the high probability that Beijing will cheat on any deal. That is why his negotiators have insisted that U.S. tariffs remain on Chinese goods until they demonstrate changed behavior\u2014not just promise to change as they have in the past.\"",
    " Title: Income Inequality in the U.S. Reaches Record High, Top 1% Captures Over Half of National Income Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis by economist Emmanuel Saez reveals that the income growth in the United States in 2015 was significant, with the bottom 99% of the country's income distribution experiencing a 3.9% increase, the best increase in 17 years. However, the top 1% of the country far outpaced this growth, with their income increasing by 7.7% last year, reaching a new high.\n\nDespite two years of income growth for the majority of Americans, they have yet to fully recover from the recession. The bottom 99% saw their incomes fall 11.6% during the height of the recession from 2007 to 2009. Afterward, they grew just 7.6% between 2009 and 2015, not enough to make up for the downturn. Incomes for the 99% have only recovered about 60% of what they lost.\n\nOn the other hand, the incomes of the 1% grew 37% between 2009 and 2015, capturing more than half of all the income growth in the country over that period, leaving just 48% to spread out among the bottom 99% of families.\n\nThe top 10% of American earners took home more than half of all income last year, the highest share ever except for 2012. Income inequality is now at the highest level the country has ever recorded in its entire history.\n\nWhile most data only goes back to the turn of the 20th century, economists Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson used tax records, directories, and historical accounts to go back even further. They found that in the country's earliest post-colonial history, inequality was quite low and much lower than countries across the Atlantic.\n\nAs the country's economy rapidly expanded in the 1800s, inequality rose alongside it. Even so, at the heights of that era's inequality, it never reached the levels we see today.\n\n\"We went from one of the most egalitarian places in the world to one of the least,\" Williamson told the Washington Post. \"What happened?\"\n\nMany factors have contributed to growing income inequality, but a lot of them have to do with taxes. Since the late 1990s, income inequality has been driven by the rich getting more and more of their money from returns on investments, something the less well-off are less likely to benefit from, and that money is taxed at a lower rate. Overall, taxes and public programs are doing much less than they used to to mitigate the growth of income inequality as taxes have been lowered on the rich while lawmakers have withered the social safety net.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Rebounds in March, Easing Concerns of Slowing Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market rebounded strongly in March, with employers adding 196,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8%. The job gains for January and February were revised up by a modest 14,000.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated 175,000 jobs were added last month. The robust job growth in March alleviated concerns that payroll growth was slowing sharply amid a cooling economy.\n\nThe February job growth was paltry, with just 33,000 additions, largely due to severe weather conditions. However, the February showing raised concerns that hiring was tapering off more than anticipated as the benefits of federal tax cuts and spending increases fade and the low unemployment rate makes it harder for employers to find workers.\n\nThe global economy, particularly Europe and China, has been sputtering, hurting manufacturers. The average monthly job growth in 2018 was 223,000, but analysts expect employment growth to throttle back this year amid the slowing economy and worker shortages.\n\nHealth care and social assistance led the job gains with 61,000. Professional and business services added 37,000; leisure and hospitality, 33,000; and construction, 16,000. Manufacturing cut 6,000 jobs, a second straight anemic showing after strong gains last year, indicating the struggling global economy and U.S. trade fight with China are taking a bigger toll. Retail, which is shrinking as shoppers shift their purchases online, cut 12,000 jobs after shedding 20,000 in February.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $27.70, lowering the annual gain from a 10-year high of 3.4% to 3.2%. Wage growth has picked up as employers compete for a dwindling supply of available workers. The faster pay increases haven't yet prompted most companies to pass their rising labor costs onto consumers through higher prices, keeping inflation subdued.\n\nHowever, further earnings gains could lead to stronger inflation, posing a dilemma for the Federal Reserve that has vowed to remain patient and forecast no interest rate hikes this year. The March jobs report helps keep the Fed in its market-friendly wait-and-see mode.\n\nThe share of American adults working or looking for jobs fell to 63% from 63.2%. From September to February, the figure had climbed fairly steadily as a healthy labor market offering more jobs and higher wages attracted discouraged workers, seniors, disabled people, and others on the sidelines. March's drop could indicate that labor force participation is resuming its longer-term decline as baby boomers retire. A lower participation rate means a smaller labor supply for employers, which could push up wages and inflation further, possibly prompting the Fed to eventually raise rates.\n\nOverall, the March jobs report offers no reason for the Fed to consider cutting rates, as President Trump has urged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 20 points, or less than 0.1%, in mid-day trading.",
    " Title: Rep. Kevin Brady Defends GOP Tax Overhaul Plan, Disputes Middle-Class Tax Hike Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a defense against criticism that the Republican tax overhaul plan could result in higher taxes for many middle-class Americans, Rep. Kevin Brady, the House's top tax-code writer, has asserted that the plan offers tax relief for families across various income levels.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News Sunday, Brady, R-Texas, and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated, \"I strongly disagree. I believe there is tax relief all up and down the income level for families, regardless of what they earn.\"\n\nThe lawmaker's comments come in response to criticisms from congressional Democrats and two analyses, including one in The New York Times that suggested one-third of middle-class families would face a tax increase. Brady dismissed these analyses, stating, \"They're describing an America that doesn't exist\u2014one where the economy never grows and one where your paycheck stays stagnant no matter what happens. I strongly disagree.\"\n\nSenate Democrats have also expressed concerns about the elimination of state and local tax deductions, warning that this could lead to voter backlash, particularly for Republican representatives in suburban districts. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told Fox on Sunday, \"The reality is many middle-class families are going to end up paying more.\"\n\nThe GOP-controlled House and Senate have each introduced separate plans, which must pass in both chambers before leaders can craft a compromise bill that gets passed by the entire Congress and put on President Trump's desk before the end of the year. The major differences between the plans include the Senate's decision to delay a corporate tax cut by one year and the elimination of all state and local tax deductions.\n\nBrady emphasized the common ground between the two plans, stating, \"There are some [differences], but there is far more common ground.\" He also expressed optimism about the House Ways and Means Committee voting on the plan in the coming days and meeting the self-imposed Thanksgiving deadline for final passage.\n\nFurthermore, Brady disputed analyses suggesting the GOP plan would increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion, arguing that critics do not take into account the tax cuts' stimulating effect on economic growth.\n\nBrady's comments echo those of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other GOP leaders, who have maintained that the plan increases paychecks and allows Americans to decide what to do with their money before the IRS gets its hands on it.",
    " Title: George Washington University Law Professor Warns of Dangerous Precedent as Obama Prepares to Issue Executive Order on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama prepares to issue an executive order that could potentially legalize five million illegal immigrants, a heated debate has ensued, with critics from both sides of the political spectrum voicing their concerns.\n\nOn Friday, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, who identifies as a liberal, appeared on The Kelly File to discuss the issue. Turley expressed his concern that the President's actions could potentially violate the separation of powers, a constitutional principle that divides the government into distinct branches to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power.\n\n\"What I'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate the separation of powers,\" Turley said. \"No president can take on the power of all three branches, and that's what he seems to be doing. He certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. He is not being particularly coy about this, you know he says 'this is what I wanted to get out of legislation and I'm going to do it on my own,' and that does become a government of one.\"\n\nTurley also cautioned the President against ignoring the results of the 2014 midterm elections, in which the Republican Party gained control of both the House and the Senate, by going around Congress on this issue despite partisan disagreements.\n\n\"It's a very sad moment, but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward, particularly after this election, to defy the will of Congress yet again,\" Turley continued. \"I can understand the frustration, these are two political parties that can't get along, but as you said, we have a democratic process, and a Congress that's coming in with the full voice of the American people behind them, that's what an election is, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.\"\n\n\"What the President is suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the Constitution,\" Turley added. \"We have a separation of powers that gives us balance, and that doesn't protect the branches. It's not there to protect the executive branch or the legislative branch, it's there to protect liberty. It's there to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty.\"\n\nTurley concluded by warning of the dangers of creating an \"uber presidency\" that could potentially wield too much power and disregard the will of Congress. \"I always tell my friends on the Democratic side, we will rue the day when we helped create this uber presidency,\" he said. \"What the Democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. They're creating a president who can go at it alone, and to go at it alone is something that is a very dangerous thing that the framers sought to avoid in our Constitution.\"",
    " Title: After DOMA Overturn, Uncertainty Surrounds Federal Benefits for Same-Sex Couples\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on Wednesday marks a significant victory for advocates of same-sex marriage. However, the question remains: what happens now that the 1996 federal law that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman has been declared unconstitutional?\n\nThe court's decision does not establish a national constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it does make married gay couples living in states where their unions are legal eligible for federal benefits already enjoyed by married heterosexual Americans. These benefits range from public employee benefits and bankruptcy to estate taxes and immigration.\n\nHowever, complications arise for same-sex spouses who are legally married but living in states that ban such unions. Twelve states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage, with the Supreme Court's decision on Wednesday effectively making California the 13th state with legal same-sex marriage by rejecting a high court challenge to a lower court-ordered right.\n\nThe tricky part in the fall of DOMA involves how states and federal agencies currently recognize marriage. Some federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, adhere to what is known as a \"place of celebration\" standard, meaning no matter where a couple is legally married anywhere in the world, the union is recognized for the purpose of federal benefits. However, other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration, hew to a \"place of residence\" standard, meaning marriage has to be recognized in the place the couple is living for them to be eligible for those federal spousal benefits.\n\nCrucial roles can be played by both the Obama administration and Congress in resolving these marriage definition disparities. Same-sex marriage advocates predict that with a Republican-dominated House, congressional action to resolve these disparities baked into law is unlikely. Congressional Democrats have written legislation that would uniformly apply a place of celebration standard, but it's unlikely to move beyond the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe task will fall to the Obama administration to implement the court's decision and decide how and whether to apply a uniform, federal agency-wide marriage definition. President Obama, in a statement issued after the ruling, said the following: \"So we welcome today's decision, and I've directed the Attorney General to work with other members of my Cabinet to review all relevant federal statutes to ensure this decision, including its implications for federal benefits and obligations, is implemented swiftly and smoothly.\"\n\n\"The administration can and should adopt a universal regulation that marriages, for federal purposes, are recognized under a state of celebration standard,\" says Ari Ezra Waldman, legal editor at Towleroad and associate director of the Institute for Information Law and Policy at New York Law School. \"Administrations have had the power to do that since the New Deal.\"\n\n\"If someone has a problem with that, then it should be up to them to challenge the changes,\" he said. \"It's a great day, but we have more litigation, more rule-making, and more work to do.\"",
    " Title: Media Scrutinizes List of Generals and Admirals Supporting Donald Trump, Raises Questions About Signatories' Past Actions and Associations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to bolster his support within the military leadership, Donald Trump, during his major policy speech on the state of the U.S. military on Wednesday, was backed by a letter signed by 88 former generals and admirals. The letter portrayed Trump as a commander in chief capable of handling \"enemies of this country [who] have been emboldened\" by perceived weakness in Washington.\n\nThe letter, which stated, \"We support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically,\" has, however, become a target for media scrutiny.\n\nOne of the signatories, retired Lt. Gen. William G. \"Jerry\" Boykin, has been under the spotlight due to his past actions. Boykin, a co-founder and former commander of the elite Delta Force, was reprimanded for disclosing classified information in his 2008 memoir, \"Never Surrender: A Soldier's Journey to the Crossroads of Faith and Freedom.\"\n\nBoykin, who is also known for his controversial remarks, such as his 2003 statement, \"I knew that my God was a real God, and his was an idol,\" has long maintained that the disclosures were permitted and suggested that the investigation was politically motivated.\n\nThe list of generals and admirals was compiled by Army Maj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow, a Holocaust survivor, and Rear Adm. Charles Williams of the Navy.\n\nThe Daily Beast, in a story titled \"The Disgraced and Little-Known Generals Backing Donald Trump,\" reported that four signatories were involved in the 1991 Tailhook Association scandal, where more than 100 Navy and Marine Corps aviation officers were alleged to have sexually assaulted 90 people at the 35th Annual Tailhook Association Symposium in Las Vegas. None of the signatories were charged, although one later served as a Navy lawyer in the case.\n\nThe Washington Post, in an attempt to create a divide between Trump and his military backers, noted that retired four-star Army Gen. Burwell Bell III was once a top NATO commander, and then pointed out that Trump has questioned NATO's usefulness.\n\nThree other four-star generals supporting Trump \"all retired more than 20 years ago,\" the Post wrote.\n\nCNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who dismissed the names on Trump's list, stating, \"I didn't recognize many of those names as being there in the fight with me over the last 16 years. There are not a whole lot of names in the fight against Al Qaeda or several of the other forces.\"\n\nHillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the November presidential race, also seemed to downplay the significance of Trump's military support, stating, \"Compare where Trump is with where both Romney and McCain were. They had between 300 and 500. I am doing better than any Democrat. He is doing worse than recent Republicans.\"\n\nFor his part, Trump thanked the military brass for their support. \"I thank each of them for their service and their confidence in me to serve as commander in chief,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Keeping our nation safe and leading our armed forces is the most important responsibility of the presidency.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Federal Workers' Data Breach: 4 Million Records Compromised, Suspected Chinese Hackers Implicated\n\nArticle:\n\nChina-based hackers are suspected of breaching the computer networks of the U.S. government's personnel office, stealing the identifying information of at least 4 million federal workers, American officials confirmed on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated in a statement that data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Interior Department had been compromised.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the incident to determine how and why it occurred, according to the DHS statement. The breach is believed to have been orchestrated by hackers based in China, as per Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and member of the Senate intelligence committee.\n\nCollins described the breach as \"yet another indication of a foreign power probing successfully and focusing on what appears to be data that would identify people with security clearances.\" A U.S. official, who chose to remain anonymous, suggested that the data breach could potentially affect every federal agency. One key question is whether intelligence agency employee information was stolen, and if former government employees are also affected.\n\nKen Ammon, chief strategy officer of Xceedium, stated that the attack fits the pattern of those carried out by nation states for the purpose of espionage. The stolen information could be used to impersonate or blackmail federal employees with access to sensitive information, he added.\n\nThe OPM is the human resources department for the federal government and conducts background checks for security clearances. The agency stated it is offering credit monitoring and identity theft insurance for 18 months to individuals potentially affected. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents workers in 31 federal agencies, is encouraging members to sign up for the monitoring as soon as possible.\n\nIn November, another cyberbreach compromised the private files of more than 25,000 DHS workers and thousands of other federal employees. DHS's intrusion detection system, known as EINSTEIN, identified the hack of OPM's systems and the Interior Department's data center, which is shared by other federal agencies. It remains unclear why the EINSTEIN system did not detect the breach until after so many records had been copied and removed.\n\nDHS is continuing to monitor federal networks for any suspicious activity and is working aggressively with the affected agencies to conduct investigative analysis to assess the extent of this alleged intrusion, according to the statement. Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the hack \"shocking,\" as Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defenses.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., stated that the government must overhaul its cybersecurity defenses. \"Our response to these attacks can no longer simply be notifying people after their personal information has been stolen,\" he said. \"We must start to prevent these breaches in the first place.\" Federal agencies are reportedly rushing to install two-factor authentication with smart cards, a system designed to make it harder for intruders to access networks. However, implementing that technology takes time.",
    " Title: Analysis: The Impact of Jim Clyburn's Endorsement on the Democratic Primary and the Future of Social Welfare Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the ongoing Democratic primary race, South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. According to exit polls, 61% of voters said Clyburn's endorsement was an \"important factor\" in their decision, and 27% said it was the \"most important factor.\"\n\nClyburn, a longtime friend of Biden, has argued that the former Vice President has been a reliable vote for government programs that benefit the black community. He also suggested that a Biden presidency would improve reelection prospects for congressmen and congresswomen running for election down-ticket.\n\nHowever, the endorsement has sparked debate about the role of government and the future of social welfare programs. The question remains: will a President Biden or Bernie Sanders, should either win the primary, significantly alter the current trajectory of social welfare programs?\n\nIn a recent column, political analyst Star Parker argued that the differences between the two candidates are minimal, with the realities of their administrations being \"barely distinguishable.\" Parker's view is that the United States is already well on its way to socialism, and without major reforms, the trend will continue.\n\nParker's argument is supported by data from the American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry, who shows that transfer payments, which make up a significant portion of the federal budget, have increased dramatically over the past few decades. In 1950, transfer payments accounted for less than 20% of the federal budget, but by 2012, they were 70%.\n\nFurthermore, according to a recent Wall Street Journal opinion column by former Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm and former Bureau of Labor Statistics assistant commissioner John Early, more than 80% of all taxes are paid by households with incomes in the top 40%, while more than 70% of government transfer payments go to households with incomes in the bottom 40%.\n\nThe implications of these statistics are significant, as they suggest that a large portion of the population is reliant on government programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps. The average household income in the bottom 20% is $4,908, but these households receive $45,389 in government transfers, according to Gramm and Early.\n\nThe unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare are around $50 trillion, which is more than twice the annual GDP. This means that government will need to take more taxes to keep these programs running, leading to an increase in socialism.\n\nThe question remains: will President Biden or Bernie Sanders, should either win the primary, introduce reforms to bring more market forces into the picture? Parker argues that the chances are zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the endorsement of Joe Biden by Jim Clyburn has sparked debate about the role of government and the future of social welfare programs. While the differences between Biden and Sanders may be minimal, the long-term implications of their administrations could have significant consequences for the future of social welfare programs and the overall direction of the country.",
    " Title: South Korea's Successful Response to COVID-19: A Closer Look at the Factors That Slowed the Spread\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, South Korea stands out as a beacon of success, with a significantly lower number of cases and deaths compared to other major countries. As of April 2, South Korea had fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases and 169 deaths, while the United States had more than 240,000 cases and more than 5,800 deaths on the same day.\n\nThe difference between the two countries can be attributed to several factors. South Korea's rapid and aggressive response to the virus, which included early mass testing, contact tracing, and isolation, has been instrumental in limiting the spread of the disease. The South Korean government began developing and stockpiling test kits in early January, even before the first case was reported in the country.\n\nThe experience of a 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea exposed vulnerabilities and forced an overhaul of the country's epidemic response. A single patient infected with MERS, caused by a different coronavirus, brought the disease from the Middle East, was treated at three hospitals, and sparked outbreaks in each one, infecting 186 people and killing 38. The epidemic was quashed in two months by quarantining nearly 17,000 people, but the experience badly damaged the popularity of then-President Park Geun-hye.\n\nIn response, Seoul drew up new rules for health crises, empowering the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to take full authority to direct local responses. Social norms established during MERS made the population willingly adopt mask wearing in public. South Koreans learned that because any new virus can spread exponentially, stamping out each new outbreak quickly is the key to avoiding catastrophic growth.\n\nJust three days after news broke on Dec. 31 of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan, China, the KCDC set up a response team to study the virus. Once the first case appeared, authorities started tracking the health of some 3,000 people who had traveled to Wuhan over the previous two weeks. The KCDC assembled a vast public-private network to produce and administer tests, including drive-through centers, and established labs to process them.\n\nHowever, in mid-February, a \"super-spreader\" was identified in Daegu, the third-biggest city, who had infected hundreds of people at several services at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Over 10 days, cases soared from fewer than 50 to more than 5,000. South Korea quickly surged its testing to some 20,000 people a day, but it also took more extreme measures.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in allowed the use of invasive surveillance tactics to track worshippers at Shincheonji churches across the country. South Korea's phone companies have each user's national ID number. So authorities were able to follow the movements of infected people and identify those they had interacted with over the past 14 days. Those contacts were then told to self-isolate and report their temperatures daily. Their compliance was voluntary, but South Koreans know the government can monitor their movements through phone data and an extensive CCTV network of 8 million cameras. Anyone who tested positive was sent to one of the quarantine centers set up in hotels and company dorms.\n\nThe other Asian countries with effective responses to the pandemic are Singapore, Vietnam, and Taiwan. All were previously hit by the 2003 epidemic of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a terrifying 10 percent fatality rate. Because of swift measures in affected areas, it killed just 774 people. In the aftermath, all three countries adopted new health policies involving mask wearing, testing, and tracking. When COVID-19 hit, populations in those countries had masks at home, and high enough levels of social trust to quickly obey government orders to report for testing and stay at home. Taiwan has had just five deaths from COVID-19; Singapore has had six.\n\nIn contrast, the Trump administration's failure to test and impose distancing rules for two months let the virus gain a foothold and led to the current exponential increase in cases. But it's not too late to implement much wider testing. South Korea has tested 1 in every 119 of its people. The U.S. says it has performed 1.2 million tests, but since each patient is given at least two tests, that works out to fewer than 1 in 500 Americans. Most Americans who suspected they were infected have not been able to get tested. At this point, with more than 300,000 known infections and probably far more, tracking contacts will be impossible.\n\n\"To try to do contact tracing on thousands on thousands of people is like trying to do the census in a couple of hours,\" says Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. And the U.S.'s culture of individualism and states' rights make it unsuited to extensive contact tracing, surveillance of infected people, and other extreme measures. Governors in eight states were still resisting pleas this week by federal health officials that they issue mandatory stay-at-home orders, citing fears of infringing on \"personal liberty.\" Even when he finally surrendered to pressure, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2014who earlier allowed spring breakers to party on beaches for weeks\u2014exempted religious services. \"I do not think that the government has the authority to close a church,\" DeSantis said.",
    " Title: Pelosi Leaves Door Open for Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump, Addresses Government Shutdown and Border Wall Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will officially take office on Thursday, did not rule out the possibility of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, stating that the decision would depend on the findings of the special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPelosi, who has previously called impeachment a \"divisive activity,\" emphasized that Democrats would not initiate impeachment proceedings for political reasons, but nor would they avoid it for the same reason. The Constitution stipulates that impeachment proceedings must begin in the House, where Democrats will now hold a majority.\n\nRegarding the ongoing investigation led by Robert Mueller into contacts between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, Pelosi stated, \"We should not be impeaching for a political reason, and we should not avoid impeachment for a political reason.\"\n\nPelosi also addressed the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its 19th day, with Trump insisting that it will continue until he receives funding for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Pelosi told NBC's Savannah Guthrie, \"How many more times can we say no?\" She added, \"There is no amount of persuasion he can use.\"\n\nPelosi also commented on the difficulty of negotiating with Trump, stating, \"He resists science, evidence, data, truth.\" She added, \"It's hard to pin the president down on the facts.\"\n\nIn response to criticism from Trump regarding her holiday trip to Hawaii, Pelosi stated, \"The president may not know this, but Hawaii is part of the United States of America.\" She also noted that she was available on 24-hour notice.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the campaign or with his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations. It remains unclear whether a sitting president can be indicted, with Justice Department guidelines suggesting that he cannot. Pelosi referred to the potential for a president to be indicted after leaving office as an \"open discussion.\" She added, \"Everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department's Acting Attorney General Indicates Special Counsel's Russia Investigation is Near Completion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare statement, the acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, indicated on Monday that the Special Counsel's Russia investigation is nearing completion. This is the first official statement from the Department of Justice regarding the status of the investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nWhitaker, who took over the Department of Justice after the resignation of Jeff Sessions, stated, \"The investigation is, I think, close to being completed.\" He provided no timeline for the conclusion of the nearly two-year investigation that has cast a shadow over Trump's presidency.\n\nSo far, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has charged 34 individuals, including several close to the president. However, no one close to the Trump campaign has been accused of conspiring with the Kremlin to influence the election.\n\nWhitaker's comments mark a departure from the Department of Justice's usual policy of not commenting on the state of the investigation. His appointment as acting attorney general and his oversight of the Mueller probe have been met with criticism, as he has not recused himself from the Russia investigation despite his past public criticisms of it.\n\nAccording to Department of Justice regulations, Mueller is required to provide a report to the attorney general at the conclusion of his investigation detailing his prosecution decisions. The form and public release of this report are uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether it will be delivered to Whitaker or his successor, William Barr, who has been nominated to serve as the next attorney general.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denounced the Russia investigation as a \"witch-hunt\" and maintains there was no collusion. The evidence to date suggests that a broad range of Trump associates had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 campaign and transition period, and several have been found to have lied about these communications.\n\nOn Friday, longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone became the sixth Trump associate to be charged by Mueller. Stone is expected to plead not guilty to charges of lying to lawmakers, engaging in witness tampering, and obstructing a congressional investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a departure from the usual behavior of defendants facing charges, Stone has been vocal since his pre-dawn arrest, holding an impromptu news conference, appearing on weekend television interviews, and posting on Instagram.\n\nAdditionally, on Monday, a judge delayed the sentencing of Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in Virginia, as a judge in Washington decides whether Manafort intentionally lied to investigators. Manafort was convicted of eight financial crimes last year.",
    " Title: Stagnant Wages: A Persistent Challenge for the Next U.S. President\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, NPR examines four major issues the next president will face from day one in office, with a focus on the issue of stagnant wages.\n\nMichael Hall, a 30-year-old elevator operator at Seattle's Space Needle, has been a witness to the ups and downs of American paychecks for seven years. He initially shared in the success of the popular attraction, receiving regular raises due to a union contract. However, the contract expired, and Hall's pay has remained stagnant for the past four years.\n\n\"I could put some money into savings every check. Still go out, grab a beer. But after about two or three years, suddenly it was like there's seven of us in a house. And then finally I started to find myself, about a year ago, living paycheck to paycheck,\" Hall said.\n\nThis story is not unique. Most Americans are not seeing significant wage increases, despite a slowly recovering job market. In April, the official unemployment rate dropped below 5.5 percent for the first time in seven years. However, the problem of stagnant wages goes back much further, with average wages barely keeping pace with inflation since 1979.\n\nJohn Pallaoro, a self-employed truck driver, recalls his paychecks stretching further four decades ago. \"I was able to purchase a suburban house in the mid-'70s for the price of barely one year of wages, two years at the most,\" Pallaoro said. \"My standard of living is probably reduced by 50 percent from 40 years ago.\"\n\nStagnant wages are not just a problem for individuals. When workers like Hall and Pallaoro do not have money to spend, it impacts the entire economy. Experts point to a variety of causes for wage stagnation, including sluggish productivity growth. In the first decades after World War II, American productivity climbed steadily, nearly 3 percent every year. However, in the mid-'70s, that growth downshifted to less than 2 percent.\n\nJames Pethokoukis, an economic policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, suggests that boosting economic growth through reduced taxes and spending could help address wage stagnation. \"The default Republican position would be you need to reduce taxes, you need to reduce spending so more of America's economic resources are being run by the private sector,\" he said. \"And that would boost economic growth.\"\n\nOther proposals, such as education reform and increased investment in public works, are also intended to boost productivity. However, there is also a disconnect between productivity and wages, with workers not necessarily seeing the benefits even as they produce more.\n\nLarry Mishel, president of the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute, argues that policymakers need to focus more on shaping the rules of the economic game so that average workers can command higher pretax wages. \"The problems with people's paychecks is not what the federal government is taking out in taxes. It's what employers are not putting in,\" Mishel said.\n\nElevator operator Hall agrees, complaining that while his paycheck has remained stagnant for the past four years, business at the Space Needle has been booming. \"We're busier than we ever were,\" Hall said. \"One full elevator, that pays most of us working for the day. And we'll do that 100 times. It's sort of insulting that they can't afford to keep paying us enough to live in the city.\"\n\nThere is one period in the past 35 years that offers a glimmer of hope for struggling workers: the late 1990s, a time when not only was the economy growing fast but the gains were widely shared, with workers on every rung of the economic ladder climbing together. \"What was distinct about that period can be summarized in two words: full employment,\" said economist Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Or maybe three words: very full employment.\"\n\nUnemployment in the late '90s was below 5 percent. Some months it fell below 4 percent. This gave workers everywhere leverage to demand higher wages. Short of full employment, Bernstein says, there are other policies that could boost workers' bargaining power, including a higher minimum wage, steps to make it easier for unions to organize, and immigration policies that limit the growth of a shadow workforce.\n\nMany of these policies will be debated over the next year and a half by those who seek to occupy the White House. As the U.S. economic elevator starts to climb again, a central challenge for the next president will be ensuring more American families are not stuck on the bottom floor.",
    " Title: Federal Grand Jury Indicts Individual in Russia Investigation, Stirring Political Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal grand jury has indicted an individual in the ongoing Russia investigation, a move that is expected to send shockwaves throughout the Trump administration and Washington D.C. The indictment, while not revealing the identity of the individual, marks a significant escalation in the investigation that has loomed over President Trump's first year in office.\n\nThe development comes after a week of intensifying criticism from conservative circles towards Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Trump-aligned media figures have seized upon a CNN report suggesting that Clinton campaign officials funded the creation of the Steele dossier, an intelligence document detailing Trump's Russian ties, to discredit the overall Russia investigation. However, it is important to note that the FBI's inquiry predates the dossier, and officials have reportedly stated that it played no role in the intelligence assessment of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPresident Trump himself has joined the chorus of criticism, claiming on Twitter that former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should be the focus of scrutiny. This tweet was a response to the common consensus, reached after many months, that there was no collusion between Russia and Trump.\n\nThe indictment represents a major step forward for the Russia investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Justice Department's investigation on May 17, 2017, following a two-week political firestorm triggered by President Trump's dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey on May 9. The selection of Mueller was a response to the controversial firing of Comey, who was dismissed amidst a series of political controversies.\n\nIn the days following Comey's dismissal, Trump undermined his initial justification for the firing on multiple occasions. He told NBC News' Lester Holt that Comey's firing was related to the Russia investigation, and that he would have fired Comey regardless of the Justice Department's recommendations. He also warned Comey on Twitter that the former director should hope there were no tapes of their White House conversations. In response, Comey released a series of contemporaneous memos detailing his meetings with Trump earlier in the year.\n\nThe memos collectively depicted a president who had little regard for the traditional firewall between the White House's political operations and the Justice Department's criminal investigations. In one instance, Comey wrote that Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn shortly after Flynn's departure as national-security adviser. Trump had fired Flynn, a close but controversial political ally, in February for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe identity of the individual indicted remains unknown, and the specific charges have not been disclosed. The development, however, underscores the ongoing nature of the Russia investigation and its potential impact on the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA Test Results Spark Controversy and Questioning of Ancestry Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing President Donald Trump's derisive nickname of \"Pocahontas,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released the results of a DNA study this week, revealing potential Native American ancestry in her family tree. However, the results, which showed a Native American ancestor in Warren's family tree \"in the range of 6\u201310 generations ago,\" have sparked controversy and questions about the authenticity and significance of her ancestry claims.\n\nThe DNA test results, conducted by Professor Carlos Bustamante of Stanford University, indicate that Warren is between 1/64th and 1/1024th Native American. This revelation has led to a backlash, with some critics arguing that the results do little to substantiate Warren's long-held claims of Native American ancestry.\n\nFor years, Warren has identified as Native American, a fact that has been a point of contention in her political career. She has been criticized for using her Native American heritage to gain an advantage in her professional life, particularly in her academic career. The Boston Globe reported just six weeks ago that Warren's Native American status was not a factor in her hiring at Harvard Law School.\n\nHowever, the issue of Warren's ancestry claims has taken on new significance in the context of the ongoing debate about identity politics and the role of minority status in American society. Critics argue that Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, even if they are true, are of minimal significance, given the remote nature of the connection.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked criticism from Native American communities, with the Cherokee Nation releasing a statement this week blasting Warren for her \"inappropriate and wrong\" use of their history and culture for personal gain.\n\nThe question remains: why did Warren choose to make these claims, and why did she release the DNA test results now? Some argue that Warren's claims of Native American ancestry have been politically useful, allowing her to position herself as a member of a historically disadvantaged minority and appealing to the intersectional logic of the Left.\n\nWhether or not Warren's claims of Native American ancestry are accurate, the controversy surrounding her DNA test results has raised questions about the role of identity politics in American society and the potential for political gain through the use of ancestry claims.",

She stated, \"You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems and I'm committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.\"\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website was down Wednesday morning, creating a split-screen moment on cable TV that showed the website's \"system down\" message and Sebelius under fire. This moment marked a significant point in the public perception of the first month of the Obamacare rollout.\n\nSebelius tried to take responsibility for the debacle, while sending a message to the American people that the landmark health care law isn't a total disaster. She acknowledged that the messy rollout has hurt the administration's credibility, but assured the public that the Obamacare website should be running smoothly for most users by Nov. 30.\n\nSebelius also revealed that she won't release signup numbers until mid-November and won't allow contractors to speak about them until she knows the information is confirmed and reliable. She admitted that even the insurers aren't getting accurate and complete data about their new customers due to the system's malfunctions.\n\nDespite a growing chorus of Republicans calling for Sebelius to resign, no one during the three-and-a-half-hour hearing demanded that she quit. Only Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) requested that Sebelius call for the resignation of Gary Cohen, the administration official heading the federal exchange office within HHS. Sebelius declined.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, however, wasted no time ripping into Sebelius during the hearing, her first congressional appearance in months. They criticized her and her colleagues at HHS for repeatedly testifying that everything was on track, only to find out that the situation was far worse than anticipated.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, offered their confidence in Sebelius. Rep. Henry Waxman and others stated that the problems with HealthCare.gov are unfortunate and should be investigated, but will be fixed.\n\nSebelius's testimony comes after Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, received a more polite treatment during her testimony before a separate House panel on Tuesday. HealthCare.gov experienced problems on Wednesday due to an outage at a data center hosted by Verizon Terremark, just days after a similar outage took down the system on Sunday night. HealthCare.gov is the main portal for coverage in the 36 states that are not running their own health insurance exchanges, and the system also provides key information to the state-run exchanges.",
    " Title: Manchin Pursues Bipartisan Gun Control Measures, Aims to Win Over NRA-Backed Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to bridge the political divide and push for gun control measures, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association (NRA), is reportedly making significant efforts to secure bipartisan support. Manchin, along with Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has been attempting to negotiate with Republican senators, including Tom Coburn (R-OK), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Dean Heller (R-NV), but progress has been slow.\n\nAs the gun control debate heats up in the Senate, with the Senate Judiciary Committee approving an assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity ammunition magazines, Manchin is leading a group of senators in crafting legislation to expand background checks on firearm purchasers. The group is hoping to attract at least one pro-NRA Republican, with the belief that this could open the door for more support.\n\nThe support of Republican senators will be crucial in determining the level of backing the effort receives from red-state Democrats, who have so far shown lukewarm interest. In an effort to broaden the coalition, Manchin has proposed combining his background check plan with a proposal from pro-NRA Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) that modifies gun restrictions for the mentally ill.\n\nSenator Begich, in response, suggested that Manchin needs to win over more Republican senators than just moderate Illinois Senator Mark Kirk. \"I know he would like to get a criminal background check completed,\" Begich said of Manchin. \"His challenge is, and I wait for him to finish off his discussions, he needs to bring one or two A-rated NRA Republicans on board. With all due respect to Sen. Kirk, he\u2019s an F-rated. You need an A-rated.\"\n\nThe central issue in the debate is whether retailers should be required to retain records of gun sales or purchases. Manchin, the self-proclaimed \"eternal optimist,\" is working diligently to win over Republicans and believes he is making steady progress before officially proposing a new bill, either with a small group of senators or with a bipartisan coalition. When the bill is unveiled and reaches the floor, Manchin is confident that pro-gun senators will vote for it, even if they decline to sign on at the moment.",
    " Title: Alabama Republican Party Accepts Defeat in Senate Race, Calls for Bipartisan Cooperation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released late Tuesday, Alabama Republican Party Chairman Terry Lathan acknowledged the conclusion of the state's contentious Senate race, with Democrat Doug Jones emerging victorious over GOP candidate Roy Moore. Lathan expressed the party's disappointment in the close race, marked by allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore.\n\nLathan emphasized the party's respect for the democratic process, stating, \"While these issues weren\u2019t discussed and no other Democratic Senator has worked with the Republicans, all eyes will be on his votes.\" She also noted Jones' campaign rhetoric of reaching across the aisle to collaborate with Republicans.\n\nLathan further commented on the conservative nature of Alabama voters, stating, \"Alabamians are conservative and have no intentions of moving toward the policies of the Democrat Party.\" She added, \"If Mr. Jones aligns himself with the liberal Democrats in Washington, Alabama voters will remember his choices in the 2020 U.S. Senate election.\"\n\nDespite the tight margin, with Jones holding 49.9 percent of the vote compared to Moore's 48.4 percent, Moore's campaign has yet to concede the special election. Alabama state law mandates an automatic recount when election results are within 0.5 percentage points.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday night, Moore did not concede, stating, \"When the vote is this close, it is not over.\" Meanwhile, Jones delivered an exuberant speech in Birmingham, emphasizing unity and finding common ground. Jones is the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama since 1992.",
    " Title: Uncertainty Over Sequester Cuts Threatens Job Creation and Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nLawmakers are expected to take their time deciding how to replace the sequester of automatic cuts scheduled for next year, a move that experts say could lead to hiring slowdowns and possible layoffs this fall. The so-called sequester, which no one in Congress likes but can't agree on how to replace, would total about $110 billion next year alone, with half the cuts coming from defense and the other half from non-defense spending on domestic programs.\n\nThe prolonged uncertainty over future funding levels is causing concern among businesses and federal agencies, which need to plan for the year ahead but can't due to the lack of clarity on how many contracts will be funded and which programs will be cut back on.\n\nDemocrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the uncertainty created by the specter of sequestration is a real threat to the economy. \"That uncertainty, which is created by... the specter of sequestration... is a real threat to this economy,\" he said at a National Press luncheon.\n\nThose in the defense industry say the sequester is already having a chilling effect. Samuel Strickland, CFO of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, said during a recent investor call, \"In the past we'd add head count [in summer] to prepare for new work. This year, we'll clearly take a more conservative approach until we see what's going to shake out.\"\n\nAt Lockheed Martin, the largest U.S. defense contractor, the story is similar. \"We are already taking action by not hiring and training new workers, not investing in new plants and equipment and not investing in new R&D,\" said company chairman and CEO Robert Stevens during a Senate caucus lunch in March.\n\nStevens also warned that if he doesn't get clarity soon, he may be forced to issue notice this fall of possible layoffs in 2013. The federal WARN Act requires businesses with more than 100 employees to notify workers at least 60 days in advance of a mass layoff or plant closing.\n\nLayoff notices are likely to be a measure of last resort for both federal agencies and private sector contractors, said government contracts expert Dan Gordon, who used to run the White House Office of Procurement. Instead, he expects a \"dramatic slowdown in hiring\" this fall.\n\nGordon also expects federal agencies over the next seven months to be very reluctant to enter into new commitments with contractors, even though government has become more heavily reliant on contractors to do everything from guarding office buildings to running IT departments.\n\n\"Why make a commitment that might end up being costly to you?\" said Joseph Minarik, senior vice president of the Committee for Economic Development.\n\nLike Gordon, Minarik believes hiring freezes are the greatest risk on the jobs front this fall. But more than anything, he said, for everyone in the public and the private sector, \"all the time being spent on planning for this situation is pure economic waste.\"",
    " Title: \"Democratic Establishment Rallies Behind Biden Amid Sanders Momentum: A Closer Look at the 2020 Primary Race\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Democratic Party establishment has rallied behind Joe Biden following his strong performance in the Super Tuesday primaries. After a close race with Bernie Sanders, who won Utah, Colorado, Vermont, and is projected to win California, the race for the Democratic nomination is set to be a grueling contest that will likely go on until the convention.\n\nThe sudden surge in support for Biden, who was previously struggling in the polls and had little money or campaign organization, can be attributed to one factor: the establishment's fear of a Sanders presidency. The argument is that Biden, despite his perceived flaws, is a more electable candidate who can unite the party and defeat Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nThe establishment's support for Biden was sparked by his victory in the South Carolina primary, which was largely due to the endorsement of House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Following this win, several Democratic candidates, including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O'Rourke, dropped out and endorsed Biden, as did several other Democratic officials.\n\nHowever, the establishment's support for Biden is not based on his policies or his temperament, but rather on the fact that he is not Bernie Sanders. Sanders, who openly identifies as a socialist and is considered the most left-wing candidate in the race, has consistently polled well against Trump and has an army of dedicated activists and a strong fundraising machine.\n\nWhile Sanders' policies may be more progressive, Biden's record is also a cause for concern. He has a long history of voting for policies that are at odds with the modern Democratic Party's branding, such as the Iraq War, the bankruptcy bill, and various crime and war on drugs bills. Additionally, Biden has a history of making up fake stories and has been criticized for his handling of women and his cognitive abilities.\n\nThe Democratic establishment's support for Biden risks deflating the activist energy that has built up around Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Younger voters, who are flocking to Sanders in large numbers, may decide not to vote in November if they feel the fix is in.\n\nIn conclusion, the Democratic establishment's support for Joe Biden is a gamble that could very easily backfire. While the establishment may fear a Sanders nomination, nominating Biden could lead to a weak and unsteady candidate who may not be able to defeat Trump in the general election. Democratic voters should carefully consider their choices and listen to their hearts when making their decision.",
    " Title: An Analysis of the Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate and Its Impact on the U.S. Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, questioning whether Powell or Chinese President Xi Jinping is America's bigger enemy. The President has also accused the Federal Reserve of being the root cause of economic problems, calling for interest rates to be reduced to zero or less.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's dual mandate, established by Congress in 1977, requires the institution to maintain price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The first part aims to control the money supply and create financial system stability, while the second mandate is to boost employment.\n\nHowever, the implementation of this dual mandate has been met with criticism. The goal of controlling the money supply is ludicrous, as the Fed has no more ability to determine the correct supply of money than an agency set up to determine the correct amount of bread or steel. Determining the right supply of money should be left to competitive markets, as argued by economists such as F.A. Hayek, Larry White, and George Selgin.\n\nThe Fed's second mandate of boosting employment is also questionable, as it reflects the belief that the government should create, control, and maximize the number of jobs. This expectation is unrealistic, and the Fed's reliance on the now academically debunked idea of a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment (the so-called \"Phillips curve\") has led to contradictory policies that have prolonged recessions.\n\nQuantitative easing, a policy pursued by the Fed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, has led to higher inflation, reducing the spending power of retirees and others living on fixed incomes. The Fed has also pursued policies that discourage saving and investment, leading to reduced capital expenditures and slowing the growth of labor productivity and real output after the recession.\n\nThe politicization of the Fed, as noted by the late Fed historian Allan Meltzer, has led it to pursue policies that go against the objective of price stabilization and financial stability. Milton Friedman once said, \"Money is much too serious a matter to be left to the central bankers.\" Given the existence of the Fed, it is crucial to ensure it is not being swayed by political interests.",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Satisfaction with Removal of FBI Officials Involved in Trump-Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement made on Tuesday, President Donald Trump expressed his satisfaction with the removal of FBI officials who were involved in the Trump-Russia probe, referring to it as one of his \"greatest achievements\" during his tenure.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago, where he is currently on Christmas vacation, Trump stated, \"These were dirty people. These were bad people. These were evil people, and I hope that someday I'm going to consider it my greatest, or one of my greatest achievements, getting rid of them.\"\n\nThe President's comments came in response to a question about a potential pardon for Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who was indicted in the special counsel's investigation on charges of making false statements to Congress. Stone, who worked briefly on the Trump campaign and has known Trump for decades, was convicted on Nov. 15.\n\nWhen asked about a potential pardon for Stone, Trump said, \"I haven't thought of it. I think it's very tough what they did to Roger Stone, compared to what they do to other people on their side.\"\n\nThe President also expressed his belief that Stone was treated \"very unfairly\" in the special counsel's case. He added, \"Now they're finding out it was a big hoax. They're finding out it was a horrible thing. We were spied on, my campaign was spied on.\"\n\nPresident Trump did not specifically identify whom at the FBI he is glad to have ousted. Notable departures include former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired on May 9, 2017, and Andrew McCabe, who served as FBI deputy director and was fired on March 16, 2018, after the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility and the Justice Department's inspector general found that he lacked candor during interviews about the authorization of media leaks in October 2016.\n\nPeter Strzok, the former deputy chief of counterintelligence, was fired on Aug. 10, 2018, over anti-Trump text messages he exchanged with FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Page resigned from the bureau on May 4, 2018. Strzok was the lead investigator on Crossfire Hurricane, the counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign. Comey and McCabe were also directly involved in the investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general found that the FBI made \"significant inaccuracies\" in applications for surveillance warrants against Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The FBI relied heavily on the Steele dossier to obtain the warrants, even though investigators had evidence that undermined dossier author Christopher Steele's credibility.",
    " Title: Married Women's Shift in Voting Preferences: A Potential Trend in the 2020 U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming 2020 U.S. elections, a potential shift in voting patterns among married women is emerging, with a growing number of these women leaning towards the Democratic Party. This trend, if it continues, could significantly impact the outcome of the elections, particularly in suburban districts.\n\nChristine Garcia, a 37-year-old stay-at-home mom in Birmingham, Michigan, is one such example. While she identifies as a fiscal conservative, Garcia finds President Trump's demeanor unpresidential and has stated that she would not vote for him in the 2020 elections.\n\nThis shift among married women, according to Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg, is a significant change, with 57 percent of married women disapproving of President Trump's job performance, a number that has increased significantly in the last year and a half. In contrast, in March 2017, the president's disapproval rating was at 40 percent among married women, according to Greenberg.\n\nThe possible shift in voting patterns among married women is a topic of debate, with some suggesting it may be a response to President Trump's administration, while others see it as a permanent realignment.\n\nIn Michigan's 11th Congressional District, two women, both in their 30s, are vying for an open seat in Congress. The race between Republican Lena Epstein and Democrat Haley Stevens, who worked on the Obama administration's auto bailout, highlights the ideological divide among female voters.\n\nRepublican women, married or single, consistently tout the health of the economy as a key factor in their voting decisions. Deb O'Hagan, a 60-year-old member of the Bloomfield Republican Women's Club, emphasized the economic growth since the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, this economic argument does not seem to resonate with all women, particularly younger ones. Fewer than 50 percent of American women are married, according to data from the Census Bureau. Single women tend to be younger, more racially diverse, and less educated. Young women, regardless of marital status, tend to lean Democratic.\n\nBridget O'Connor, a 25-year-old marketing professional, expressed her priority as getting the president out of office. Around Michigan's 11th Congressional District, NPR met many married women who, despite not traditionally engaging in Democratic Party politics, are now actively campaigning for candidates.\n\nLouri Jouppi, a married woman from Canton, Michigan, stated that the 2016 election was the time she decided she might never vote for a Republican again. Jouppi and her friend Sonia Patel, a stay-at-home mom, both agreed that they are willing to pay more taxes if it means upholding their moral values, particularly in relation to immigration policies.\n\nPatel, who used to vote for a mix of Democrats and Republicans, joined the board of the local Canton Democratic Club after the 2016 election, stating that motherhood and age have turned her from a moderate into a Democrat.\n\nThis shift in voting patterns among married women, if it continues, could have a significant impact on the 2020 elections, particularly in suburban districts. The question remains, however, whether this shift is a temporary response to President Trump's administration or a permanent realignment in the political landscape.",
    " Title: Pew Research Center Study Reveals Deepening Partisan Divide in U.S. Ahead of Election 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 Presidential Election approaches, the winning candidate will inherit a deeply divided American electorate, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center. The study indicates that the two major political parties are drifting further apart on key demographic measures, a trend that is likely to persist in the coming years.\n\nThe report, titled \"Election 2016: A Deepening Divide,\" highlights the significant changes in the makeup of the two parties, with the Republican Party becoming whiter, older, and more religious, while the Democratic Party is becoming more diverse, younger, and less religious.\n\nThe divide is not merely superficial, as the parties hold contrasting views on a range of issues, from affirmative action and education funding to abortion and immigration. The report suggests that these differences are not merely a matter of degree but of kind, creating a chasm that the next administration will find challenging to bridge unless a concerted effort is made to promote national reconciliation.\n\nThe report notes that the Republican Party is becoming increasingly white, with the proportion of whites in the GOP coalition dropping from 88% in 2008 to 86% in 2016. Conversely, the proportion of whites in the Democratic coalition has decreased from 64% in 2008 to 57% in 2016.\n\nSimilarly, the report shows that the Republican Party is becoming older, with college-educated voters decreasing as a percentage of the GOP and increasing as a percentage of the Democratic vote. The report also reveals a growing religious divide, with 29% of the Democratic coalition identifying as atheist, agnostic, or having no religious affiliation, compared to 12% of the GOP.\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, writes in the report that the deepening divide is likely to exacerbate the crisis of governance that has plagued the United States for years. He warns that the campaign is not helping to reduce partisan polarization but is instead making it worse.\n\nGalston's report concludes that the winning candidate will face a daunting task in bridging the divide between the two parties, urging a focus on an agenda of national reconciliation starting on Day 1 of the transition. The report serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead for the next administration, regardless of which candidate emerges victorious on Election Day.",

Either they are going to have to really tighten their belt and keep tightening, because it's going to get worse.\" He further added, \"There are going to be further screws tightening down in the maximum pressure campaign and try to grit their teeth and get to November 2020 in hopes that their desired outcome emerges.\"\n\nPetraeus also cautioned Iran against overplaying their hand and provoking a response that could be \"quite punitive.\"\n\nThe current tension between Tehran and Washington is fueled by reports of bombings and attacks across the region that have been linked to Iranian-backed terror groups, as well as the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord with Iran over a year ago.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which the President has criticized as \"the worst deal in history,\" has led to the reimposition of crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In response, Iran has threatened to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has also stopped its sale of excess uranium and heavy water, as required under the deal.\n\nThe Trump administration's recent deployment of an aircraft carrier and other military resources to the Persian Gulf region, as well as the withdrawal of nonessential personnel from Iraq, has raised concerns among Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill over the possibility of a confrontation with Iran. However, President Trump has downplayed any potential for conflict.\n\nThe ongoing tension between the two nations remains a topic of debate and concern, with many lawmakers demanding more information about the administration's actions and intentions.",

The event, hosted by the New Hampshire Republican State Senate Political Action Committee, is taking place in Manchester, with ticket prices ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nSteven Duprey, a member of the Republican National Committee from New Hampshire, emphasized the significance of the Granite State, home to the first primary in the nation, as a platform for presidential aspirants. He stated, \"For candidates who might not have as much money as some others, or who aren't yet nationally known, this is a great time to come to New Hampshire to start to introduce themselves and to listen to what New Hampshire voters are concerned about.\"\n\nDuprey, who managed Sen. John McCain's campaign during the Arizona Republican's 2008 bid for the White House, highlighted the importance of intimate interactions with voters, as opposed to formal speeches, for success in New Hampshire. He cited McCain's victory in the state after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucus as an example.\n\nIn the past, both President Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney have won the New Hampshire primary. The University of Virginia's Center for Politics recently ranked potential 2016 candidates, placing Jindal, an Indian-American, in the second tier of candidates for the GOP nomination. The center identified Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as frontrunners, with Jindal and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky considered as strong contenders.\n\nThe 2016 presidential race is still in its early stages, and many potential candidates have yet to formally announce their intentions. However, Jindal's appearance in New Hampshire, following his term in Congress, is being closely watched by political observers as a potential sign of his presidential ambitions.",
    " Title: Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore Suspended Over Same-Sex Marriage License Order\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roy Moore, was suspended on Friday following allegations of violating the state's judicial ethics laws for ordering state probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite federal and U.S. Supreme Court rulings to the contrary.\n\nAccording to news website AL.com, the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission has charged Moore with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, an allegation that could potentially lead to his removal from office. The legality of gay marriage had been a contentious issue for years, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, marking a historic victory for the American gay rights movement.\n\nIn January, Moore issued an administrative order to state probate judges, directing them not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents. The complaint states that Moore \"flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority,\" and \"knowingly ordered [probate judges] to commit violations...knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office.\"\n\nMoore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, contends that the commission has no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. In a statement, he said, \"We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail.\"\n\nIn his order, Moore argued that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The conflicting opinions led to \"confusion and uncertainty,\" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so.\n\nUntil the Alabama Supreme Court decides the matter, probate judges \"have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license,\" Moore said. The complaint, however, asserts that Moore's order \"was contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no confusion or unsettled question.\"\n\nMoore, a Republican, has been a prominent figure in conservative causes. In 2003, he was removed from office after a federal judge ruled he was placing himself above the law by refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He regained the chief justice job in 2012, vowing not to create further friction with the federal courts.",

The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York on Tuesday provide more detailed accounts of Cohen's financial relationships than previously known.\n\nThe requests for emails were made six months into Trump's presidency, with the emails sought dating back as far as June 2015. Mueller is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members.\n\nSince pleading guilty, Cohen has publicly turned on Trump, testifying before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform that his former boss was a \"racist,\" \"con man,\" and \"cheat.\" Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison term on May 6.\n\nThe released documents show how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen's Apple iCloud account, allowing him to coordinate his work across devices such as an iPhone, iPad Mini, and laptop. The bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen's dealings unrelated to Trump, and suggest that his financial situation was dire.\n\nAccording to the documents, Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than $20 million in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned. The FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to.\n\nAmong the payments Cohen was believed to have received was $600,000 from AT&T Inc for consulting about \"political issues,\" including net neutrality, the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, and tax reform. Another $583,333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg, the documents showed.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have criticized Cohen's consulting work, arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures. The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws.\n\nCohen also used Essential Consultants to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, the porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with the two women.\n\nMoscow has denied meddling in the 2016 election, though U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that it interfered to help Trump win. Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, and described the Mueller probe as a political witch hunt.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Swift Action on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Outlines Key Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, President Barack Obama called on Congress to move forward with a comprehensive immigration reform bill, stating that the \"time is now\" to address the issue of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. During a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, the President outlined key principles he believes should be included in any reform bill, such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe President emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to immigration reform, stating that Congress must deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently residing in the country. He also indicated that if Congress does not act swiftly, he will send his own bill to Capitol Hill and insist that they vote on it immediately.\n\nThe President's speech comes on the heels of a bipartisan group of senators, known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" unveiling their own outline for comprehensive reform on Monday. The Senate framework includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased border security, crackdowns on businesses that employ undocumented immigrants, and the bringing in of skilled immigrant workers to the United States.\n\nThe President praised the Senate's plan, stating that it is \"very much in line with the principles I've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.\" He expressed optimism about lawmakers' efforts to craft their own proposals, but warned that \"action must follow.\"\n\nRepublicans have reacted cautiously to the President's speech. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the Gang of Eight, noted that there are \"some differences\" between him and the President. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed concern about the President's unwillingness to accept significant enforcement triggers before current undocumented immigrants can apply for a green card.\n\nThe President's speech also addressed other issues, such as the ability for gays and lesbians to \"seek a visa on the basis of a permanent relationship with a same-sex partner\" who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and the need for a guest-worker program for agricultural industries and other companies that rely on low-skilled immigrant labor.\n\nThe President's stance on a path to citizenship did not satisfy all Republicans working on an immigration reform plan. However, the President's speech was received warmly by the crowd inside Del Sol High School's gymnasium, with chants of \"s\u00ed se puede\" echoing throughout the speech. The changing political landscape has sparked momentum for comprehensive immigration reform, with seven in 10 Latino voters backing President Obama over Republican Mitt Romney in last November's election.",
    " Title: Former ICE Director Thomas Homan's Outburst at Congressional Hearing Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated congressional hearing on Thursday, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Thomas Homan, displayed a contentious and defiant demeanor, drawing criticism for his behavior and raising concerns about the agency's conduct and policies under his leadership.\n\nThe hearing, held by the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, focused on the conditions in ICE detention centers, which have been the subject of numerous reports of human rights abuses. More than 50,000 immigrants are currently being held in ICE custody, with private, for-profit prisons housing nearly three-fourths of them. Reports issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General in June 2019 and September 2018 found that ICE facilities are filthy, brutal, and dangerous. Immigrants, including children, are routinely denied access to medical care, live in filthy conditions, are given expired and unsafe food, denied hygiene items, and denied recreation and visitation. Detainees are illegally placed in solitary confinement and strip-searched. At one facility, inspectors found nooses in 15 different cells. At least 24 immigrants have died in ICE detention under Trump.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chaired the subcommittee on Thursday, is the sponsor of a bill, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2019, that seeks to address these problems. The measure would heighten standards for ICE facilities, increase inspections, grant more robust rights to detainees, and phase out ICE's use of private prisons. It has 130 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, all Democrats. Jayapal sought to use the hearing to explore the cruelty inflicted on ICE's victims. Witnesses included Selene Saavedra Roman, a Dreamer wrongfully detained by ICE for six weeks; Denis Davydov, a gay HIV-positive immigrant wrongfully detained by ICE while seeking asylum from Russia; and Blanche Engochan, a Cameroon refugee subjected to horrific mistreatment in ICE detention.\n\nThese survivors had important and heartbreaking stories to tell about the trauma they suffered at the hands of ICE officers. Yet Homan repeatedly hijacked the hearing to express his outrage about the real victims of all this, himself and the agency he used to lead. He shrieked at congressional Democrats, accusing them of making \"inaccurate and disgusting\" attacks on his agency. He praised ICE detention facilities, insisting that they \"have the highest standards in the industry\" and the \"best facilities in the world.\" In fact, Homan suggested that the U.S. spends too much money taking care of ICE detainees, declaring: \"I think a lot of taxpayers would be insulted on the amount of money we spend on such a high standards.\" And he charged Democrats with \"grandstanding political theater to attack our president and this administration and the men and women who serve in this administration.\"\n\nThe most indelible moment arrived when Homan's time expired\u2014and he refused to stop speaking. Jayapal attempted to gavel him down, but he continued to insult her. His rant ended with a moment of rage as he lectured Jayapal: \"I'm a taxpayer, you work for me!\"\n\nThis was not Homan's first blowup at the prospect of having to answer to criticism. Earlier this month, Homan engaged in a similar performance, attempting to shout down Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after his time expired. Like Jayapal, Ocasio-Cortez had to gavel him down.\n\nIt was hard to miss the symbolism of Homan training his rage and condescension on two women of color. When he took over ICE, he instilled a culture that emboldened agents to disregard the rights of minority populations. Multiple ICE officers infamously lied repeatedly to a federal court in an effort to deport a Dreamer, falsely accusing him of gang affiliation. A federal judge also ruled that ICE officials had made \"demonstrably false statements to the Court\" and concealed key facts in its quest to deport 100 Iraqi immigrants. ICE agents arrested a victim of domestic violence at a courthouse where she had sought a protective order, allegedly acting on a tip from her abuser. The agents then appear to have lied about the incident on an affidavit, claiming they approached her after she exited when surveillance footage showed them accosting her inside the courthouse.\n\nThese incidents demonstrate how ICE operated under Homan's watch. Agents felt free to illegally detain immigrants, then deceive courts to secure their deportation. They treated their targets as legal non-persons, in a crusade to detain and deport as many as possible. ICE has gone after lawful immigrants, too, attempting to revoke their green cards for no good reason. Homan claimed he simply sought to enforce the laws on the books. But when state legislators began to limit local law enforcement's ability to cooperate with ICE, Homan announced on Fox News that those lawmakers should be charged with crimes.\n\nThe first wave of coverage of Homan's outburst Thursday came from right-wing media, praising his defiance. It was pure Trumpism, the elevation of culture war over the basic constitutional order. Thomas Homan does not recognize the authority of Pramila Jayapal or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He does not think he has to follow their rules. He does not believe that two women of color have any right to hold power over him. \"You work for me!\" the former government employee screamed at an elected member of the government. He is a man who is used to wielding power against people who look like Jayapal and Ocasio-Cortez. He is the embodiment of ICE under Trump, certain\u2014as so many ICE officers are\u2014that he answers to no one.",
    " Title: Russian President Vladimir Putin Emerges from 11-Day Absence Amid Health and Location Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made a public appearance on Monday in St. Petersburg, ending an 11-day absence that sparked a flurry of speculation regarding his health and whereabouts. Putin's last public appearance was on March 5, when he was seen with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\n\nOver the past week, the Kremlin released undated photo and video footage of Putin, 62, which only fueled the rumors about his health, control of the government, and even his personal life. The Kremlin has not commented on these rumors.\n\nDuring a press conference in Russia's second city, Putin joked about the health rumors, saying, \"It would be boring without gossip.\" Images published on social media did not indicate any unusual changes in his appearance.\n\nIndependent Russian TV channel Dozhd reported that Putin may have been absent due to a bout of the flu and self-isolation at his residence in the Novgorod region. Meanwhile, Austrian newspaper Kurier suggested that he was receiving treatment in Moscow from an Austrian orthopedist for back problems. The Kremlin has not confirmed or denied these reports.\n\nAlexei Makarkin, vice president of the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies, stated, \"Discussing the president's health is the same thing as aiding the enemy.\" Makarkin attributed this secrecy to the legacy of the former Soviet Union.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin's absence added to the speculation when he ordered a surprise inspection of parts of the nation's military but did not show up for the drill. The unscheduled inspection of Russia's Northern Fleet, which includes 38,000 military personnel and 3,360 pieces of military hardware, was confirmed by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, according to the Interfax news service.\n\nFurther fueling the speculation, a planned visit by Putin to Kazakhstan was rescheduled for March 20. Moscow has expressed concern about an increase in NATO exercises held near the Russian border. The recent events have brought renewed attention to the annexation of the Black Sea Peninsula, which occurred one year ago, marking the annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.",
    " Title: President Trump's UNGA Debut: A Week of Diplomacy, Reforms, and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) appearance on Monday marks a new chapter in U.S. foreign policy, as the President seeks to assert his \"America First\" agenda on the global stage. The four-day event in New York will see Trump pushing for UN reforms, rethinking America's financial contributions, brokering economic deals, and addressing global threats such as North Korea, Iran, and Islamic State.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, described the event as a \"new day\" at the UN, emphasizing action over talk. However, the unpredictable nature of Trump's presidency has left many world leaders uncertain about the U.S.'s role and their relationship with the new leader of the free world.\n\nIn the eight months since Trump took office, he has demonstrated a willingness to use American military and economic power, with missile strikes on Syria, get-tough trade measures on China, and threats against North Korea. This unpredictability has left world leaders questioning Trump's next move.\n\nJon Alterman, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted, \"The world is still trying to take the measure of this president. World leaders still wake up in the morning if they happen to be a friend of the president of the United States, [and] they also wonder what does it mean to be a friend of the president.\"\n\nThe grueling schedule, which includes a highly anticipated speech to the assembled delegations on Tuesday, will test Trump's skills and endurance, particularly given his propensity for going off script and disregarding convention.\n\nTrump's schedule includes discussions on UN reforms, meetings with leaders of France, Israel, and several South American countries, and a working dinner at Trump Tower. He will also deliver his first address to the assembly, emphasizing the need for peace and prosperity while upholding sovereignty and accountability.\n\nThe President's focus on sovereignty is seen as a signal of his pledge to more aggressively defend U.S. national interests, a departure from the more \"globalist\" foreign policy of his predecessor, President Obama.\n\nTrump may also face uncomfortable moments over his sharp criticism of the Iran nuclear deal and the North Korea crisis, with resistance expected from U.S. partners in the deal and the North Korea problem potentially escalating to a Pentagon-led resolution.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, U.S. Ambassador Haley suggested that the UN Security Council has run out of options on containing North Korea's nuclear program, hinting at a possible military solution.\n\nThe UNGA will provide a significant test of Trump's diplomatic skills, as he navigates a complex web of global challenges and seeks to assert his vision for America's role in the world.",
    " Title: James Comey's Petty Descriptions of President Trump Draws Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent excerpt from his new book, former FBI Director James Comey's descriptions of President Donald Trump have raised eyebrows and criticism. The passages, released Thursday, appear to be petty in nature, with Comey describing Trump's appearance in a manner that some find unbecoming of a former FBI director.\n\nThe excerpts describe Trump's face as slightly orange with bright white half-moons under his eyes, where Comey assumes he placed small tanning goggles, and his impressively coifed, bright blond hair. The passage also mentions the size of Trump's hand, stating that it was smaller than Comey's, but not unusually so.\n\nCritics argue that these descriptions are unnecessary and unprofessional, especially given the serious nature of the allegations that Comey makes elsewhere in the book. Some argue that these descriptions make Comey look childish and petty, rather than an unbiased narrator.\n\nOne particular passage that has drawn criticism is where Comey refers to the \"soft white pouches\" under Trump's \"expressionless blue eyes.\" This passage is followed by a statement that suggests Trump does not understand the FBI's role in American life. This serious charge is preceded by unnecessary attacks on Trump's appearance, which some argue undermines Comey's credibility as a witness.\n\nPresident Trump himself has responded to the book's release, tweeting that Comey is a \"proven leaker & liar\" and that he should be prosecuted for leaking classified information and lying to Congress under oath.\n\nSome argue that Comey's descriptions of Trump's appearance are intended to get a rise out of the president, given that Trump has been sensitive about his hand size in the past. However, others argue that these descriptions are hack and overdone, with the hand and tan skin jokes being made millions of times before.\n\nIn response to Comey's book, President Trump tweeted a series of messages that some argue made him look unhinged. Trump's tweet storm was intended to be self-defense, but it wound up drawing attention away from the serious allegations made in the book and instead focused on the president's reaction to the book's release.\n\nIn the end, some argue that it would be best for all parties involved to act more adult and focus on the serious allegations made in the book, rather than engaging in petty attacks on each other's appearance.",
    " Title: Third-Party Candidates Face Tight Race to Qualify for Presidential Debate Stage\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., approaches, third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are racing against time to meet the 15 percent national polling threshold to qualify for the debate stage. The candidates have a unique opportunity this year, as both major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have high disapproval ratings, according to GOP pollster David Winston.\n\nJohnson, the Libertarian Party nominee and former Republican governor of New Mexico, has come close to the 15 percent mark in several surveys, reaching as high as 12 percent in a Fox News poll released this week. Johnson's campaign has relied heavily on digital content and media coverage to get his message out, but is now looking to traditional campaign activities such as rallies and advertising. Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, will hold their first rallies of the cycle this weekend in Nevada and Utah, with additional rallies in Colorado and New Mexico expected later.\n\nStein, the Green Party nominee, is making a concerted push to attract supporters of former Democratic contender Bernie Sanders. She has grabbed headlines for her criticism of Clinton, but in a new television ad, she savages both major party candidates. Stein will get her own CNN town hall on Aug. 17, a significant moment for her campaign.\n\nHowever, both candidates have faced setbacks in their legal challenges against the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). A district court judge threw out a case brought by the third-party candidates challenging the polling threshold, and Johnson still has a separate legal challenge against the commission outstanding. The CPD could come under pressure as the debates near if Johnson or Stein are climbing in the polls.\n\nPollsters interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 are doubtful either candidate will make the debate stage. \"I think it's unlikely, unless both major party candidates start leaching base support,\" said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. \"While third-party candidates are set to do better this year than in most cycles, the 15 percent threshold is too high a hurdle.\" If they miss out on the first round, there will be a vice presidential match-up in October and two more presidential debates that month.",
    " Title: Florida Reports Record-Breaking COVID-19 Cases Amidst Ongoing Debate on School Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida reported a staggering 15,000 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, surpassing the daily record set by any single state, casting a spotlight on a state that has become one of the global hotspots for the virus. The Florida Department of Health reported 135,992 results from people who have never been tested before, and 15,299 of those tests came back positive for Covid-19. The positivity rate of new infections was 11.25 percent, marking a two-week low and a significant decrease since the state's record high of 18 percent reported on Wednesday.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis' administration has continued to present the new numbers in a positive light, a strategy that has faced increasing criticism as Florida has emerged as one of the biggest virus hotspots in the world. In response to the new numbers, DeSantis' communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, tweeted, \"Florida COVID positive cases decline for a third day in a row to 11.25 % despite a record 142,981 tests results returned in a single day.\" The tweet, however, includes figures that include those who have been tested multiple times.\n\nThe administration has also faced criticism for its handling of hospitalization data. For months, the administration refused to disclose the information, but relented after continued pressure by the Miami Herald and other media outlets. On Friday, the DeSantis administration released current hospitalization numbers, which showed 6,974 patients hospitalized with coronavirus as their primary diagnosis, a number that jumped to 7,507 on Sunday.\n\nThe increased daily case counts and continued double-digit positivity rate come as the issue of reopening Florida's schools becomes the newest politicized coronavirus battlefield. Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, a DeSantis appointee and former Republican speaker of the Florida House, issued an order last week telling school districts they must open classrooms for five days a week beginning next month. Corcoran must approve a district's reopening plan before they can get their cut of state funding.\n\nThe demand to reopen the state's schools coincided almost to the day with President Donald Trump's beginning a forceful push to get the nation's schools back open, an effort the administration is making as Trump's poll numbers slump less than four months ahead of Election Day. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told Fox News on Sunday, \"There has to be a posture of doing something, of action, of getting things going, putting a plan together for your specific school, for your specific district or for your classroom that ensures that kids are going to start learning against this fall.\"\n\nPublic health experts note that the spread in younger populations increases the likelihood of people in at-risk populations, like seniors, getting sick. Young \"survivors are reporting significant remaining health issues (fatigue, inability to return to normal levels of exercise) and significant financial burden (loss of work, medical costs),\" Jill Roberts of the University of South Florida College of Public Health told a news outlet last week.\n\nThe increased number of deaths and hospitalizations, as well as the continued high positivity rate, has sparked criticism of the administration's handling of the pandemic. \"The fact that the governor's office seems to think that 93 dead Floridians is an accomplishment is heartless and disturbing,\" Kayser Enneking, an anesthesiologist and Democrat running for a Gainesville-area Florida House seat, tweeted in response to Ferr\u00e9's tweet. \"Also, a 12.75% positivity rate means we still have uncontrolled community spread.\"",
    " Title: Romney Delivers Scathing Critique of Trump in Speech Aimed at Derailing GOP Front-Runner\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated speech on Thursday, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner, labeling him a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" The speech, delivered at the University of Utah, marked a significant escalation in the ongoing feud between the two men and represented Romney's most robust effort yet to rally the party and primary voters against Trump.\n\nRomney, who lost the 2012 presidential race to President Barack Obama, criticized Trump's business record, his policies, and his character. He mocked Trump's record of building companies, referencing lesser-known ventures like Trump Mortgage, and warned that a Trump presidency would lead to recession and make America and the world less safe.\n\n\"I understand the anger Americans feel today,\" Romney said, \"but here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing... the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.\"\n\nRomney also claimed that if Trump were to be nominated, it would enable Hillary Clinton to be elected president. The speech comes ahead of the Republican primary debate Thursday night in Detroit, the candidates' first showdown since Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump swiftly responded to Romney's criticism, taking to Twitter to claim he's the \"only one who can beat Hillary Clinton\" and recalling Romney's record in the presidential elections so far. He also refused to rule out mounting an independent bid.\n\nSen. John McCain, the party's 2008 nominee, and 2016 candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich both expressed concerns about Trump in statements and tweets following Romney's speech. Romney has not yet endorsed a candidate in the race, and there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested Republican convention as a last-ditch effort to derail Trump.\n\nThe speech comes after Trump racked up a string of Super Tuesday wins, building a wide, though not insurmountable, delegate lead over closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Romney has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul, and last week, he called for Trump to release his tax returns as soon as possible and criticized him for not immediately disavowing the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. Although Trump did later disavow Duke, Romney called his response \"disqualifying and disgusting.\"",
    " Title: Ryan's Email Campaign Sparks Speculation Among Republican Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan has been sending a series of emails to select Republican leaders, causing some recipients to question the speaker's intentions. Some view the emails as self-advertisements, while others interpret them as campaign materials for a potential presidential run.\n\nRyan, who has publicly stated his disinterest in the presidency, has been sending these emails since his appointment as Speaker in October. One email reads, \"no matter the outcome of this year\u2019s crucial presidential election, your Republican House majority will continue to fight for conservative values.\" The email also includes a \"Leadership Priority Survey\" to collect input and guide the party's agenda.\n\nOne prominent RNC member, who requested anonymity, shared with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they have received over ten emails from Ryan in the past week, a frequency they had not experienced before. They asked, \"What do you think is up?\"\n\nA state GOP chairman attending the four-day meeting in Florida, who also requested anonymity, believed the emails were self-promotional for Ryan.\n\nRyan's emails come at a time when the RNC is debating whether to adopt rules for the party's national presidential nominating convention that would make it more difficult to bring in a \"white knight\" to take the nomination from Ted Cruz or Donald Trump. The speaker's emails are, therefore, particularly relevant to the RNC meeting.\n\nRyan's relationship with conservatives has been strained due to his promise that a Republican-controlled Senate and House would curb President Obama's liberal policies. The speaker's email campaign is, thus, a topic of interest and speculation among Republican leaders.",
    " Title: Koch Brothers Launch Multi-Million Dollar Campaign Against Trump's Trade Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, US billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch are funding a multi-million dollar campaign against President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Three political groups backed by the brothers, including Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity, and the LIBRE Initiative, will employ advertising, lobbying, and grassroots campaigns to advocate for free trade.\n\nThe Koch brothers, who run Koch Industries, one of the world's largest privately owned firms, are urging the president to lift the recent tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, as well as proposed tariffs on other imports from China. The campaign comes in response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nDavid Koch, 78, stepped down from the company due to health reasons, as announced on Tuesday. In a letter, Charles Koch, 82, expressed his sadness about his brother's departure, stating, \"David has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way.\"\n\nThe Koch-backed groups' campaign against Trump's tariffs is a reflection of business groups' concerns about the impact of the tariffs. Leaders from the EU, Canada, and Mexico have criticized the move and threatened retaliation, sparking fears of a trade war. On Tuesday, Mexico imposed a wide range of new tariffs on US goods, including steel, pork, and bourbon.\n\nTrump has defended the steel tariffs, stating they will protect US steelmakers, which he considers vital to national security. However, the Koch network of political organizations, traditionally a reliable cash machine for Republicans, has expressed concerns about the tariffs' potential negative effects on the economy.\n\nThe Koch brothers' company, the second-largest privately owned business in the US, has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels. Despite their political activism and significant financial contributions to conservative causes, they have also supported criminal justice reform and donated large sums to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn 1980, David Koch ran as a vice-presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party. The brothers are known more for their political activism than their corporate brands, having spent millions of dollars on supporting conservative policies, particularly those seeking to roll back regulations. Last November, the brothers helped fund Meredith Corporation's deal to buy US magazine publisher Time Inc.",
    " Title: CBO Estimates: Obama's Executive Amnesty to Cost Taxpayers $10.2 Billion in Tax Credits Over a Decade\n\nIn a recent letter to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that President Obama's unilateral executive amnesty will cost U.S. taxpayers $10.2 billion in Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credits (ACTC) over the next ten years.\n\nThe CBO's assessment is based on the House of Representatives Department of Homeland Security funding bill, which aims to repeal both of Obama's executive amnesty programs: the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the 2014 Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program. The bill is projected to decrease on-budget deficits by $8.8 billion over ten years due to billions in tax credit spending cuts.\n\nAccording to the letter, the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit are refundable tax credits, which reduce a taxpayer's overall income tax liability. If the credits exceed the tax liability, the excess may be refunded to the taxpayer, resulting in outlays in the federal budget. The CBO estimates that the decrease in outlays for refundable credits projected for the 2015\u20132025 period would be primarily due to decreases in EITC.\n\nThe letter further explains that H.R. 240 would decrease the amount of EITC by decreasing the number of people with Social Security numbers, which are required for taxpayers and dependents to qualify for EITC. In essence, since Obama's amnesty grants millions of illegal immigrants Social Security numbers, it will result in billions of new spending on those same illegal immigrants.\n\nThis CBO letter contradicts Obama's promise to the American people that illegal immigrants granted amnesty under his program would not be offered \"the same benefits that citizens receive.\" The CBO letter also estimates that amnestied immigrants will pay $22 billion in Social Security payroll taxes over the next ten years. However, like all Social Security recipients, unless they are deported, amnestied immigrants will eventually be a net drain on the Social Security system, taking out far more in benefits than they paid in.",
    " Title: Tea Party Shifts Strategy: Moderate Candidates Gain Support Over Hardline Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from their hardline conservative stance, members of the Tea Party Patriots and Tea Party Express have expressed a new priority: winning the Senate rather than electing hardcore conservatives. This change in strategy has led to the endorsement of moderate candidates such as Sen. Pat Roberts and Sen. Scott Brown, according to The Hill.\n\nThe shift is also evident in the support for South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds for a Senate seat, as reported by The Hill. This \"hold your nose and vote\" attitude, as described by Adam Brandon, Executive Vice President of FreedomWorks, is based on the growing realization among tea party supporters that a moderate win is better than no win at all.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, president of the Tea Party Patriots, echoes this sentiment, stating that their members prioritize a Republican-controlled Senate and ousting Majority Leader Harry Reid as their top priority.\n\nThis new approach marks a near 180-degree turn from the tea party's 2010 election strategy, when the focus was on making a statement and challenging the establishment, regardless of potential GOP losses. The change comes after the tea party failed to win key battles in the latest primary fight.\n\nTea Party Express founder Sal Russo explained this change, stating, \"In 2010, we thought it was very important to get people's attention and so we had to make that statement and challenge the establishment. 2014 was the time to take back the Senate \u2014 it wasn't a time to purify the party.\"\n\nThis shift in strategy also follows declarations from Republican Party figures like Karl Rove and Sen. Mitch McConnell that tea party influence is harmful to the GOP. This rift, yet to be fully repaired, has been a point of contention in recent months.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group yet to join the moderate-leaning tea party bandwagon, noted the ongoing rift, stating, \"Conservatives didn't take out a hatchet. Mitch McConnell and the establishment Republicans did. There is no evidence they have buried that hatchet, and the grassroots is very, very aware of the establishment-induced rift in the party.\"",
    " Title: Investigation Launched into $400 Million Border Wall Contract Awarded to Fox News-Favored Firm\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Defense's internal watchdog has launched an investigation into a $400 million border wall contract awarded to North Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel Co., following concerns over the firm's lack of operational requirements, late and over-budget prototypes, and potential influence from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Pentagon's inspector general sent a letter to House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson on Thursday, announcing an audit of the contract awarded to Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. Thompson, D-Miss., had requested the review last week, citing these concerns.\n\nTommy Fisher, the head of the family business, said Thursday that there would be \"nothing to find\" in an audit. \"We were told we were the lowest price and the best value,\" he said. \"We look forward to working with the Army Corps of Engineers.\"\n\nThe border wall is one of Trump's top priorities. He campaigned on a promise to build a \"big beautiful wall\" between the U.S. and Mexico, with Mexico paying for it, and promised to build 450 to 500 miles by the end of 2020. As of Nov. 1, Trump had built 78 miles.\n\nTrump's effort to push through funding, using money from the Pentagon after Congress refused to fund the wall, has been met with resistance and lawsuits. A federal judge this week blocked the administration from spending some Defense Department money on the barrier, including the contract for Fisher.\n\nFisher Sand and Gravel Co. was awarded a contract on Dec. 2 to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona, part of a series of contracts to increase mileage. Fisher had made a number of appearances on Trump's favorite cable news channel \u2014 Fox News \u2014 talking about his desire to win a contract. However, the firm has little experience with such construction, and a previous proposal was rejected.\n\nFisher said his company could do the work for $13 million a mile. He said the next closest bid was $20 million a mile. A letter from the Army Corps when Fisher was awarded the contract said the company's proposal was both technically acceptable and the best priced.\n\nTwo administration officials familiar with the matter told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 this year that Trump aggressively pushed the Fisher firm's bid with the heads of Homeland Security and the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages wall contracts. The interference in federal contracting by a president concerned some overseeing the process, but the officials said Trump insisted Fisher could get the wall up faster and cheaper than other bidders. The officials weren't authorized to speak about internal discussions and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThompson had said one of his concerns was that officials from Homeland Security, the department managing border security, had toured a private barrier built by the company shortly before the contract was awarded.\n\nThe Pentagon watchdog said it was assessing how to complete the audit and would formally announce it soon. \"The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget,\" he said in a statement. \"Given the President's multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence on the Army Corps' contracting decision.\"\n\nThe award was the second-largest contract in the company's history. Previously, Fisher built highways, sold heavy equipment, and did excavation work. The company unsuccessfully sued the government in April when it was not awarded a similar contract.",
    " Title: Pre-Election Day Political Rhetoric Heats Up as Candidates Make Final Push\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 presidential election approaches, the political landscape is filled with intense campaigning and heated debates. This last Sunday before the election, political surrogates from both the Republican and Democratic parties appeared on various news programs to discuss the upcoming election.\n\nDavid Plouffe, a White House adviser who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, expressed confidence on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Obama would be re-elected on Tuesday. On Fox News Sunday, Rich Beeson, Mitt Romney's campaign manager, predicted a significant victory for Romney, stating that he would win 300 electoral votes, far exceeding the 270 necessary to secure the presidency.\n\nDavid Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, dismissed GOP claims that Pennsylvania had become a competitive state on Fox News. He stated, \"They understand that they're in deep trouble. They understand that the traditional, or the battleground, states that we've been focusing are not working out for them. Now they're looking for somewhere, desperately looking for somewhere.\"\n\nIn the crucial battleground state of Ohio, the Real Clear Politics polling average shows Obama ahead by nearly three percentage points. However, US Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a prominent Romney campaign surrogate, told CNN's Candy Crowley he believes the GOP candidate has a good chance of taking the state.\n\nLast-minute polls show a race that is virtually tied. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of likely voters published Sunday finds Obama leading Romney by a narrow margin of 48 percent to 47 percent. Another new poll, Politico/George Washington University's battleground tracking poll of 1,000 likely voters, shows the two candidates tied at 48 percent. The Real Clear Politics national polling average has Obama ahead by a minuscule margin of 2/10ths of 1 percent.\n\nAs the candidates make their final push toward Election Day, the race is expected to be determined by which candidate can turn out more of their supporters in the 10 or so competitive states. Both candidates are focusing their efforts on these states, with Obama campaigning in New Hampshire, Florida, and Colorado, and Romney in Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\n\nHurricane Sandy, this year's \"October Surprise,\" appears to have helped Obama, as he divides his time between campaigning, meeting with federal emergency management officials, and staying in close touch with state and local officials in states affected by the superstorm. In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, nearly 70 percent approved of how Obama has handled the storm.\n\nSome Republicans have criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his focus on the storm response instead of the campaign, with former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour stating on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the hurricane had \"broken Romney's momentum.\" Speaking after former President Bill Clinton in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night, Obama said that at this point in the campaign, he was largely \"a prop\" and the race was in the voters' hands. \"The power is not with us anymore,\" he told the estimated crowd of 24,000 gathered on a cold night. \"It's all up to you.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Media Accountability Amidst Nationwide Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump accused the media of being the \"true Enemy of the People,\" citing inaccurate and fraudulent reporting as a cause of the nation's current unrest. The president's comments come in the wake of a violent week that saw a spate of mail bombs and a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead and six injured.\n\nTrump's tweets read, \"There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly.\" He added, \"That will do much to put out the flame of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony.\"\n\nThe president's tweets were part of a series of messages he sent on Monday, including criticisms of Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who is black, and comments on the caravan of immigrants heading towards the U.S. border, which he described as an \"invasion.\"\n\nThe president's rhetoric has been a topic of discussion in the heated contest between Gillum and his opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, in Florida's governor race. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Florida on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's comments on Monday were met with criticism from Democrats and other critics, who have suggested that the president's rhetoric has further inflamed the nation's divisions. The president has repeatedly lashed out at the media and his critics in recent days, undercutting his own calls for unity following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the package bombings.\n\nAuthorities have charged Cesar Sayoc Jr. with addressing more than a dozen explosive devices to former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Rep. Maxine Waters, among others. The next day, Robert Gregory Bowers was arrested after police said he opened fire in the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 people and wounding six.\n\nTrump has condemned both attacks and vowed that he will not allow political violence to take root in the country. However, his critics argue that his rhetoric has contributed to the nation's current state of unrest.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Inaction on CAATSA Raises Concerns Over Russian Interference in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the warning from the CIA Director Mike Pompeo about potential Russian interference in the midterm elections, the Trump administration has opted not to impose new sanctions against foreign companies doing business with blacklisted Russian defense and intelligence bodies, as per the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\n\nDuring an interview this week, Pompeo expressed concerns about Russian intelligence agencies spreading misinformation in the U.S. and Europe, aiming to subvert politics in the West. He assured that efforts would be made to counter these attempts effectively. However, the Trump administration's actions seem to contradict this stance.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration announced that it would not be imposing any new sanctions, despite the CAATSA requirement. This decision came at a time when Pompeo's interview was airing, leading some to question the administration's commitment to enforcing the law.\n\nThe Trump administration did, however, comply with a CAATSA requirement by publishing a list of 114 Russian politicians and 196 oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more. The timing of the list's release, just before a midnight deadline, has been criticized as dilatory, further highlighting the administration's apparent antipathy towards the law.\n\nThe administration's decision not to impose sanctions on anyone on the list has angered critics, with Rep. Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stating, \"I'm fed up waiting for this administration to protect our country and our elections. They chose instead to let Russia off the hook yet again.\"\n\nCAATSA requires sanctions against large purchasers of Russian arms, but it grants exceptions for various reasons. The exception cited Monday was that the mere existence of the legislation was deterring such dealings, according to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision not to impose new sanctions has raised concerns, particularly given that several American allies, including India and Turkey, still buy military equipment from Russia. This presents a challenging situation for the administration, as noted by The New York Times.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, who helped write the CAATSA, has expressed confidence that additional sanctions may yet be announced. \"This is when sanctions season begins, and so they'll be rolling them out,\" he assured reporters Monday. \"We feel pretty good about the process.\"\n\nThe lack of immediate action on CAATSA, coupled with Pompeo's warning about Russian interference, has led to questions about the Trump administration's approach to countering Russian influence in the upcoming midterm elections.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Balance Focus on ObamaCare with Broader Campaign Themes Ahead of 2014 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2014 election approaches, the Republican Party finds itself in a favorable position, with a competitive slate of candidates, a inviting electoral map, and a strong anti-ObamaCare message. However, some within the party are urging candidates to move beyond a single-issue focus on the Affordable Care Act and present a broader critique of Democratic policies and their own positive ideas.\n\nThe Republican-leaning group Americans for Prosperity has spent approximately $27 million on ads this election cycle, nearly all of which has targeted Democratic incumbents' support for ObamaCare. In a special House election in Florida, both parties are contesting a swing district near St. Petersburg, with ads repeatedly targeting the Democratic nominee's support for the health care law.\n\nWhile ObamaCare remains a potent political issue, some within the party are concerned that a single issue may not be enough to sway enough voters. They argue that the party should turn its criticism of ObamaCare into a broader critique of Democratic policies and the failures of big-government liberalism.\n\n\"What we need to do is to convince voters that we have the wherewithal and the ideas to fix issues, to put forward those solutions that can address those concerns,\" said Republican strategist Danny Diaz. \"That is the core component of the argument, and one I think you're going to see candidates across [the] country do to a greater degree than they have before.\"\n\nSome House Republicans are already taking this advice to heart, publicly discussing their own proposals on immigration and health care. These proposals are still in the early stages, but they are part of a concerted effort from GOP leadership to define what the party stands for.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon us, as an alternative party, not just an opposition party, to have ideas that we put forward that are grounded in market principles that will work,\" said Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"The point is, you need something positive to run on.\"\n\nOther GOP campaigns have already broadened their messages. For example, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is criticizing his Democratic opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes for her position on coal, an issue of particular resonance in Kentucky's race. And attacks on ObamaCare can offer GOP candidates an opening to make a broader point about their opponent.\n\n\"Just because we're talking about ObamaCare, and that's a huge issue, doesn't mean we're going to erase decades of how Republicans run campaigns on taxes and spending,\" one GOP strategist said.\n\nNot every Republican is concerned about the party focusing too much on ObamaCare. The issue touches on so many concerns for voters - their own health care, the country's debt, and the economy - that it is inherently a broad-spectrum attack. This was bolstered this week when the Congressional Budget Office predicted the economy will lose the equivalent of 2.5 million workers by 2024 due to the health law.\n\n\"If James Carville were a Republican, there'd be a sign hanging in his office that said, 'It's ObamaCare, stupid,'\" said GOP pollster Glen Bolger. He argued that Republicans shouldn't be worried about dwelling too much on ObamaCare; they should be worried about not talking about it enough.\n\n\"Yes, we do need more than just ObamaCare,\" he said. \"But we don't need a lot more.\"\n\nIn a close race, however, the \"more\" that Bolger is talking about could make the difference between winning and losing. And it's why many Republicans, as thrilled with the political gift of ObamaCare as they are, aren't ready to bet the house on it just yet.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at U.S.-China Trade Tensions: Misconceptions and Remedies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, there has been a surge of criticism against China, with allegations of overproduction, intellectual property theft, and economic dominance by 2025. However, a closer examination of these claims reveals a complex web of misconceptions and ineffective remedies.\n\nFor instance, the notion that a centrally planned communist economy like China's can successfully drive economic growth is questionable. This is particularly puzzling given that free market advocates, who typically oppose trade barriers, are now supporting them due to concerns about China's 2025 plan.\n\nGeorge Mason University economist Don Boudreaux aptly pointed out this inconsistency, stating that those on the political right who usually believe in markets \"correctly understand that the U.S. government can not out-perform the market at 'picking' winners, but they\u2026 nevertheless believe that foreign governments, especially those governments with authoritarian histories and that currently possess authoritarian powers, are invested with uncanny abilities to improve the performance of their economies with subsidies, trade restraints, and industrial policies.\"\n\nThe argument about China's overproduction is also problematic. While it may benefit China, it is a tragedy for the Chinese people as their government's subsidization of steel production diverts resources from other areas of the Chinese economy. Contrary to popular belief, this \"overproduction\" is not a concern for Americans and Europeans, as they are not complaining about the goods China is not producing due to government intervention.\n\nAnother common argument is the loss of American steel jobs due to trade. However, the reality is that the U.S. has been importing between 25 and 30 percent of its steel for decades, leaving domestic steel with a healthy 70 to 75 percent of the market. The job losses are more likely due to labor-saving innovations (technology) implemented by American steel executives, which made individual steel workers more productive and raised their wages.\n\nThe issue of intellectual property theft is also a contentious one. While it is true that some American intellectual property is stolen in China, imposing import taxes (tariffs) is not the best solution. Such protectionist measures penalize millions of American consumers and put thousands of other American jobs at risk. A more effective approach would be to use international organizations to challenge China's actions and form alliances with like-minded allies.\n\nIt is essential to remember that new U.S. trade and investment restrictions will not make China more like the U.S., but rather, more government control over the U.S. economy will make us more like China. This article is not intended as a defense of the Chinese regime, but rather, a call to reevaluate the arguments used against China in the context of trade and to seek more effective and fair remedies.",
    " Title: President Trump's Stock Market Claims Face Challenges Amid Market Volatility and Economic Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,500 points today, marking a significant downturn in the stock market. Despite a slight recovery, the market closed with a loss of approximately 1,000 points. This volatility is likely to continue, as the President's repeated claims of credit for the market's performance may have set unrealistic expectations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been touting the stock market's performance under his administration, but the market's recent decline serves as a reminder that uninterrupted booms over four or eight years are not the norm. During last week's State of the Union address, the President boasted about the stock market's record-breaking gains, stating, \"The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.\"\n\nHowever, in response to today's market drop, unnamed White House spokespeople have stated, \"We're always concerned when the market loses any value, but we're also confident in the economy's fundamentals.\" If the afternoon's rally continues, expect the President to resume his boasting. However, it is advisable for him to exercise caution.\n\nThe market's reaction to two significant pieces of news out of Washington today may have contributed to the downturn. The first is the new debt figures, which have increased due to the tax cuts that are now in effect without any offsetting cuts in spending. This decision will push the deficit even higher and bring the debate over the debt ceiling back into focus.\n\nThe second piece of news is the concern that the Federal Reserve will adjust interest rates in response to signs that the economy is heating up, including new wage data released on Friday. These factors have caused investors to become somewhat anxious.\n\nIt is essential to note that Presidents do not control the markets. While markets can respond to politics, taking credit for the ups comes with the responsibility of grappling with the downs as well. President Trump's tendency to claim credit for factors outside of his control, such as low airline fatalities and the incidence of Christmas wishes, has been a point of contention.\n\nAnother area where the President's claims may have been overstated is in the context of unemployment rates. Black unemployment, which previously reached a low that prompted the President to boast, has spiked back up. As with the stock market, the President neither gets all the credit nor all the blame for these economic indicators.",
    " Title: EPA Announces Temporary Easing of Environmental Regulations for Industries Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to requests from various industries, including the oil sector, for regulatory relief during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a temporary easing of enforcement for certain environmental regulations.\n\nThe decision, announced on Thursday, aims to help industries cope with the challenges posed by the pandemic, which has affected millions worldwide. The EPA stated that the move is intended to alleviate the burden on regulated facilities as they strive to protect workers and the public from the virus.\n\nIn a press release, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler emphasized the agency's commitment to protecting human health and the environment. However, he acknowledged that the current situation may impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements.\n\nThe EPA's memo outlines changes that include not imposing fines for violations of certain monitoring and reporting requirements during the outbreak. The agency will instead focus its resources on situations that pose an acute risk or imminent threat to public health or the environment.\n\nThe EPA also stated that it does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that COVID-19 was the cause.\n\nThe EPA will also work with the Department of Justice to exercise enforcement discretion related to penalties previously assessed on polluting companies. The changes are retroactive to March 13.\n\nLast week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) requested temporary relief from regulatory requirements on the oil and gas industry to ensure steady fuel supplies during the coronavirus outbreak. The API expressed concerns about the impact of the virus on its ability to comply with federal environmental and safety requirements.\n\nThe oil industry has also requested waivers allowing the sale of winter-grade gasoline deep into spring and summer to manage a supply glut due to the coronavirus outbreak's impact on demand for motor fuels. The EPA memo did not address fuel waivers in Thursday's announcement.\n\nCriticism of the EPA's decision has come from more than a dozen environmental groups, who argue that the easing of environmental protections during a respiratory illness pandemic is irresponsible from a public health perspective. The groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and Wild Earth Guardians, expressed concern about the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty, and cardiovascular problems.",
    " Title: Walmart Urged to Release Surveillance Tape in John Crawford III Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the fatal shooting of John Crawford III, a 22-year-old black man, at a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio, there is growing pressure on the retail giant to release the surveillance tape of the incident. The family of Crawford, along with thousands of supporters, have signed a petition through Color of Change, urging Walmart to make the video public.\n\nCrawford and his girlfriend had gone to the Walmart last month to purchase ingredients for a family cookout. While browsing the store, Crawford picked up an unpackaged BB gun from a shelf, which was later determined to be a toy and was unloaded. A man named Ronald Ritchie, who saw Crawford with the gun, called 911, reporting a black man \"walking around with a gun in the store\" and \"pointing it at people.\"\n\nMinutes later, Crawford was shot by police, with his last words being \"It's not real.\" The gun was a toy, and it was unloaded. The incident has sparked controversy and calls for transparency, with many questioning whether Ritchie's actions and the police response were influenced by implicit bias.\n\nImplicit bias, also known as unconscious bias, is a term used to describe the subtle prejudices that people may have, even if they are not consciously aware of them. Research has shown that these biases can influence people's perceptions and actions, even among those who believe themselves to be racially equal.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine has argued that releasing the tape to the public would bias the jury. However, DeWine has shown no concern for the rampant media speculation that Crawford had a criminal record, despite the charges being dropped.\n\nWalmart is the largest employer of black people in the country, and black Americans make up a significant portion of their customers. The retail giant has an obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees and customers, particularly in light of recent incidents involving black men and the police.\n\nReleasing the tape could help shed light on what happened and bring some closure to the Crawford family. It could also serve as a catalyst for a broader conversation about implicit bias and racial inequality in America.\n\nThe shooting of John Crawford III is a tragic reminder of the lingering realities of racial bias in America. Releasing the tape could be a step towards overcoming this virus and moving towards a more just and equitable society.",
    " Title: Major Broadcast Networks Omit Hillary Clinton's Anti-Business Job Creation Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the major English and Spanish broadcast networks have omitted any mention of Hillary Clinton's remarks on Friday at a campaign event for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley, where she stated that businesses and corporations do not create jobs.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign event, Clinton told the audience, \"Don't let anybody tell you that, you know \u2013 it's corporations and businesses that create jobs. That old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried, that has failed.\"\n\nSince then, English-language networks ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, have ignored this story in both their morning and evening newscasts. This is a stark contrast to what would typically be the case if similar remarks were made by a Republican figure or future presidential hopeful.\n\nAs reported by Jeffrey Meyer of the \u2588\u2588\u2588, ABC, CBS, and NBC also omitted any mention of Clinton's comments on their Sunday morning talk shows. On the Fox News Channel's (FNC) evening news program, Special Report with Bret Baier, senior political analyst Brit Hume devoted his commentary segment to the subject following an introduction from Baier in the show's first half hour.\n\nAfter supporters spent the weekend attempting to explain Clinton's remarks, she walked back her statements during a campaign event in New York on Monday. Clinton clarified her stance by channeling some standard Democratic Party rhetoric, stating:\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades: Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out \u2013 not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.\"\n\nDespite Clinton's clarification, her original remarks and her so-called walk back have received no on-air coverage from the networks. With the 2014 midterms just a week away, coverage of Clinton's anti-business statements remains to be seen.\n\nThe full transcript of the segment that aired on FNC's Special Report with Bret Baier on October 27 can be found below.",
    " Title: Capitol Hill Republicans Threaten to Block Climate Funding for Paris Summit, Citing Lack of Senate Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nCapitol Hill Republicans are seeking to undermine President Obama's push for a global climate agreement at next week's international summit in Paris, warning they will withhold crucial funding if the president attempts to bypass Congress. The two-week U.N. conference, starting Monday under heightened security following the Paris terror attacks, aims to address climate change and foster global unity.\n\nAt a press conference alongside French President Francois Hollande, President Obama emphasized the importance of the climate summit as a symbol of global solidarity. \"What a powerful rebuke to the terrorists it will be when the world stands as one and shows that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children,\" Obama said earlier this week.\n\nHowever, at home, the country and Congress remain deeply divided over the president's plans for cutting emissions. Lawmakers are concerned that the president may etch an international pact without seeking Senate approval.\n\nCritics of the president's climate agenda have zeroed in on the president's goal of directing $3 billion \u2013 including $500 million in the near-term \u2013 for the U.N. Green Climate Fund, which would help developing nations deal with climate change. Ahead of the president's trip, dozens of lawmakers warned the president: \"No vote, no money.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) stated at a hearing last week, \"Without Senate approval, there will be no money \u2013 period.\" He and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, sent a letter to Obama signed by more than three-dozen senators, urging the president to have his special envoy relay to developing nations' representatives that Congress \"will not be forthcoming\" with the Green Climate Fund money absent a Senate vote.\n\nIn addition, Inhofe joined Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri in introducing a resolution calling for the Senate to have a say in any climate agreement.\n\nRepublicans generally argue that any deal with legally binding elements should be handled like a treaty, and subject to Senate ratification. The Obama administration, however, has given varying statements on how it views any potential pact. Secretary of State John Kerry rattled European officials when he was quoted earlier this month in the Financial Times saying any agreement was \"definitively not going to be a treaty.\" French President Hollande bristled at the notion that a deal would not be legally binding and was quoted saying if that's the case, \"there won't be an agreement.\"\n\nThe State Department clarified that the U.S. wants binding and non-binding components. An official told Politico: \"The FT interview with Secretary Kerry may have been read to suggest that the U.S. supports a completely non-binding approach. That is not the case and that is not Secretary Kerry's position. Our position has not changed: the U.S. is pressing for an agreement that contains provisions both legally binding and non-legally binding.\"\n\nHouse Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said at a recent hearing that the president doesn't want to come to Congress with a Paris agreement because \"he knows the Senate will not ratify it.\" Smith also warned a centerpiece of the U.S. commitment that Obama will bring to the table in Paris \u2013 the Clean Power Plan, regulations on power plant emissions \u2013 \"represents massive costs without significant benefits.\"\n\nAs lawmakers threaten to block U.S. support for the U.N. climate fund, The Wall Street Journal reports that the House next week also plans to vote on measures to repeal those EPA rules for power plants, on the heels of the Senate doing the same. It's doubtful Republicans could overcome a presidential veto, but the vote is a reminder of the resistance facing those regulations, which are the subject of a massive federal court case brought by mostly Republican-led states.\n\nThe administration suggests it has high hopes for the summit. Obama struck a climate deal with China before the Paris talks and plans to meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 in Paris next week. Ahead of the summit, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told FoxNews.com a historic deal will be reached. \"Everyone has actually realized that there is more risk in not addressing climate change and there is more opportunity in addressing it,\" she said.",
    " Title: \"Obama's Legislative Struggles: A Comparison with Reagan's Tax Reform Battle\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a striking parallel to President Ronald Reagan's tax reform battle during his second term, President Barack Obama is currently grappling with a significant setback in the House of Representatives, as his own party failed to secure a majority in a crucial vote on a top priority of his second term. The odds of a reversal are slim, but there is a possibility that Obama could sway enough votes to change the outcome.\n\nIn the 1980s, as Reagan worked with the Democratic majority to overhaul the tax code, House Republicans felt increasingly marginalized, believing that the president was excluding them from the process and favoring the opposition. This led to a coalition between GOP leaders and a group of disgruntled Democrats who orchestrated a plan to defeat the procedural rule for considering the tax reform bill.\n\nHowever, Reagan managed to turn the tide by making an unusual visit to Capitol Hill and appealing to his fellow Republicans. He followed up with a letter promising to work for changes in the Senate and vetoing any final bill that did not meet his objectives. The bill eventually passed the House and became law in 1986.\n\nThe current situation for President Obama differs from Reagan's in several ways that work against him. In December 1985, Reagan enjoyed a 63% approval rating, while Obama's approval rating currently hovers around 43%. Even pro-Obama Democrats express disappointment. The artist who created the iconic \"Hope\" poster recently stated that Obama had not lived up to the hope he represented.\n\nIn 1985, Republicans held a majority in the Senate, allowing Reagan's promise to work for changes in the bill to carry some weight. Obama, on the other hand, does not have this advantage, as the Democrats have lost their majorities in both chambers. Since the GOP controlled the Senate in 1985, Reagan could emulate the man who personified Republican conservatism to secure legislative victories.\n\nTime is running out for Obama, and he may need to adopt a similar strategy to secure a legislative victory with Democratic liberals. His recent meeting with House Democrats, during which he suggested that opponents of the bill were not playing straight, backfired and cost him votes. If Obama is to achieve a legislative miracle, he may need to emulate the tactics of the man who, despite political differences, managed to secure a significant legislative victory in the face of adversity.",
    " Title: Pew Research Center Reveals Increased Political Polarization Among Americans Over Past Two Decades\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Pew Research Center has revealed a significant increase in political polarization among Americans over the past 20 years. The survey aimed to understand the extent of political polarization in the United States and its impact on government, society, and personal lives.\n\nThe survey found that the percentage of Americans who hold either consistently conservative or consistently liberal positions on major issues has doubled over the past decade, accounting for 20 percent of all Americans. While 39 percent hold equally liberal and conservative positions on issues, the most politically active have become increasingly partisan and entrenched in their positions.\n\nAccording to the survey, many Americans who view themselves as consistently conservative or consistently liberal are on the extreme ends of the political spectrum, making their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process. The survey found that these intense partisans are less likely to see the parties meeting each other halfway, amplifying the voices that are least willing to compromise.\n\nThe survey also found that Americans who view themselves as consistently conservative or consistently liberal is at a 20-year peak, with 92 percent of Republicans being to the right of the median Democrat, compared with 64 percent twenty years ago. Similarly, 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican, up from 70 percent in 1994.\n\nThe study also found that these Americans' views are so polarized that most of these intense partisans believe the opposing party's policies are so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being. Political views spill over into virtually every area of partisan Americans' lives, including where they prefer to live and with whom they associate.\n\nSixty-three percent of consistent conservatives and 49 percent of consistent liberals \u2013 compared with 25 percent of those with mixed ideological views \u2013 told Pew that most of their close friends share their political views. The study surveyed 10,013 people.",
    " Title: Facebook's Free Speech Standoff: A Tale of Censorship and Corporate Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg found himself at the center of a heated debate on free speech and censorship, testifying before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C., on October 23, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nThe founder of Facebook, who once championed the value of free expression, now faces criticism for allegedly running a hate-speech machine. In a speech at Georgetown University last fall, Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of upholding free speech, citing its role in the worldwide fight for democracy and the strengthening of First Amendment protections.\n\nHowever, the response to Zuckerberg's stance has been far from positive. Instead of praise for adhering to traditional American values, the reaction has been one of condemnation. The current Facebook controversy is not just about drawing the line between permissible and impermissible content, but a battle between activists and a social media giant.\n\nInternet companies are always faced with the challenge of defining acceptable content, but the Facebook controversy is more significant. The company is under attack by left-wing activists who, with the support of corporate America, are attempting to mold Facebook to their ideals.\n\nThe Georgetown speech led to accusations that Zuckerberg believed in free expression \"deep in his bones.\" One flashpoint was Zuckerberg's reference to the importance of the First Amendment to the cause of civil rights, a point that activists found offensive. Another was Zuckerberg's stance on not censoring politicians or fact-checking political ads.\n\nThe final straw was Facebook's refusal to act against President Donald Trump's controversial post about looting and shooting. While the post was inflammatory, it was not an incitement to violence. Facebook's decision to keep the post up was an invitation to debate, a stance that activists aim to suppress.\n\nActivists have pursued two strategies in their attack on Facebook. One has been to pressure companies to stop advertising with Facebook, with many corporations willingly joining the trendy campaign of intimidation. The other has been to associate Facebook with racism and hate, creating the misimpression that the platform profits from neo-Nazi posts rather than ordinary users.\n\nDespite the criticism, Facebook's stance on free speech is commendable. A robust debate online allows the public to make informed decisions about the statements of political figures like Trump or Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The stakes are high, as Facebook is an institution too big to cancel. The advertising boycott is merely a minor setback for the company's revenue. If Zuckerberg can withstand the pressure and maintain his support for free speech, it will serve as a significant beacon in a time filled with portentous omens.",
    " Title: Federal Lawsuit Filed Against University of California, Berkeley Over Alleged Suppression of Conservative Speakers\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal lawsuit filed on Monday by the Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) and Young America's Foundation (YAF) has highlighted the University of California, Berkeley's alleged inhospitality towards conservative speakers, an issue that previously prompted a rebuke from President Trump. The lawsuit alleges that the university's vague, unwritten policy regarding \"high-profile speakers\" unconstitutionally discriminates against unpopular viewpoints.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from the university's cancellation of conservative commentator Ann Coulter's scheduled speech on campus this Thursday evening. The BCR, which invited Coulter, and YAF, which underwrote her visit, argue that the policy, adopted after violent protests forced the university to cancel a February 1 appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, unlawfully suppresses free speech.\n\nThe university had initially offered to reschedule Coulter's speech for next Tuesday afternoon, in the middle of the \"dead week\" between classes and exams. However, the BCR felt compelled to cancel an April 12 talk by another conservative journalist, David Horowitz, after the university insisted that it take place at an inconvenient location and end by 3 p.m., a time when most students would be in class.\n\nBCR and YAF claim that the restrictions imposed by Berkeley in the name of public safety have not been applied equally to left-leaning speakers, amounting to an \"unlawful heckler's veto\" that marginalizes conservative voices.\n\nIn February, President Trump tweeted that Berkeley risks losing federal funds if it \"does not allow free speech.\" If the president were to issue similar warnings to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Justice Department, he would be urging these agencies to protect First Amendment rights more vigorously.\n\nRecently, DHS demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of a DHS gadfly, a move that was seen as a blatant attempt to intimidate critics. The Justice Department is also considering criminal charges against people who share classified information leaked by others.\n\nLast month, a special agent in charge at Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of DHS, issued a summons to Twitter seeking records that would unmask the person or persons behind the @ ALT_USCIS account, which regularly criticizes the Trump administration's immigration policies. There did not seem to be any legal justification for the summons.\n\nDHS dropped the summons the day after Twitter filed a lawsuit arguing that it threatened the First Amendment right to engage in pseudonymous political speech. Last week, in response to inquiries by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), DHS Inspector General John Roth revealed that his office is investigating whether the CBP summons was \"improper.\"\n\nThe day before Roth expressed concern about government inquiries that might have \"a chilling effect on individuals' free speech rights,\" CNN and The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department is once again considering prosecuting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for sharing classified documents with the public. The Obama administration abandoned this project after concluding that charging Assange with violating the Espionage Act would create a precedent that could be used against any news organization that publishes stories based on \"defense information\" from sources who obtained or divulged it illegally\u2014a very common journalistic practice.\n\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo argues that Assange is not a real journalist, a debatable and constitutionally irrelevant point. The \"freedom of the press\" guaranteed by the First Amendment is not the freedom of people who work for officially recognized news outlets; it is the freedom to use technologies of mass communication. This freedom extends to everyone in the United States, whether or not they are professional journalists or American citizens. If Assange broke the Espionage Act by distributing classified material within the U.S., that means he used \"the press\" there.\n\nTrump, who once declared \"I love WikiLeaks!\" when it was revealing embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, has since changed his tune, now that he perceives a threat to his government's secrets. When asked about a potential criminal case against Assange last Friday, Trump said, \"It's OK with me.\"",
    " Title: Chris Rock's Insight on Inequality and the American Dream: A New Perspective on Perception and Reality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Frank Rich, comedian Chris Rock made a statement that, at first glance, may seem casual, but upon closer examination, reveals a profound insight about the perception of American society and the American Dream. Rock's comments, which focused on the disparity between the reality of inequality and the public's perception of it, have sparked a new discussion about the American Dream and its role in shaping American politics and society.\n\nDuring the interview, Rock stated, \"If poor people knew how rich rich people are, there would be riots in the streets.\" This comment, while it could be interpreted as a comment on the politics of envy or the scale of inequality today, is, in fact, a reflection on the public's perception of American society and how it influences politics.\n\nRock expanded on this idea by stating that not only the poor, but also the \"average person\" would be outraged and bewildered by the lifestyle of the 1 percent. He used the example of the Virgin Airlines first-class lounge, suggesting that the average person would be shocked by the luxuries available in such a setting.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that Americans significantly underestimate the degree of inequality in the U.S. economy. For instance, in one test, subjects estimated that the top 20 percent of U.S. households owned about 59 percent of the country's net worth, when in truth the number is closer to 84 percent. Moreover, the same study shows that even if the wealth of the U.S. economy was distributed according to the subjects' beliefs, most Americans would still consider it too unequal.\n\nThe discrepancy between perception and reality is not unique to Americans, but what sets the U.S. apart is its faith in the American Dream. The American Dream, a belief that anyone, regardless of their starting point, can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination, has been a powerful force in American society for over a century. However, a recent study by Gregory Clark, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, suggests that the American Dream is no longer operational today.\n\nClark's research indicates that social mobility in the U.S. is no better than in medieval England or pre-industrial Sweden. In fact, while Clark joins many other experts in finding that social mobility today does not make good on the American Dream's promises, he goes a step further and argues that it never did.\n\nThe American Dream, with its promise of upward mobility, has long served as a buffer between the reality of inequality and the public's perception of it. As more Americans come to terms with the fact that the American Dream is an empty promise, the 1 percent and the stewards of government will likely face increased scrutiny and pressure to address the issue of inequality more effectively. However, bridging the gap between perception and reality will not be an easy task, and the consequences could be significant.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Hold First Post-Election Meeting at the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant post-election development, President Barack Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney held their first meeting since the November 6 election at the White House. The lunch, which took place in the White House's private dining room, marked the fulfillment of a promise Obama made in his victory speech on the night of the election.\n\nThe conversation between the two leaders, spanning over an hour, primarily focused on America's global leadership and the importance of maintaining this position. The White House reported that Romney congratulated the president on his successful campaign and wished him well for the upcoming four years.\n\nThe lunch menu consisted of white turkey chili and Southwestern grilled chicken salad. This meeting, according to the White House, was their most extensive private talk to date, with their interactions during the 2012 election campaign being limited to a handful of brief exchanges and the three presidential debates.\n\nPrior to the lunch, Romney and his former running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, had a meeting to discuss the economic challenges facing Washington. Details about this meeting were not disclosed, with a Ryan aide speaking on the condition of anonymity because the aide was not authorized to discuss the private discussions.\n\nThe economic debate during the campaign centered on the expiring tax cuts first enacted during the George W. Bush administration. Obama and Romney had differing views on this matter, with Romney advocating for the extension of the cuts for all income earners and Obama running on a pledge to let the cuts expire for families earning more than $250,000 a year.\n\nThe White House views Obama's victory as a sign of American support for his tax proposals. Since his election loss, Romney has largely remained out of the political limelight, spending the past three weeks in seclusion at his family's California home. He has made no public appearances, drawing media attention only after being photographed at Disneyland, as well as visits to the movies and the gym with his wife, Ann.",
    " Title: Boko Haram Releases Video Showing Over 100 Kidnapped Schoolgirls, Demands Prisoner Exchange\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling development, a new video believed to be from the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram shows more than 100 kidnapped Christian schoolgirls praying to Allah and announcing their conversion to Islam. The video, obtained by the Associated Press, features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who is reportedly in negotiations with the Nigerian government, stating that he will hold the girls until imprisoned militants are freed.\n\nThe video, which is 27 minutes long, shows the girls wearing black and gray hijabs and reciting the Koran in Arabic. Many of the girls, who range in age from 15 to 18, are barefoot. Some appear fearful, while others seem desolate. One girl in the video stated that they had not been harmed, according to the BBC.\n\nThree of the girls are shown speaking in the video. Two of them say they were Christian and have converted to Islam, while the other says she is Muslim. Shekau is also seen in the video, announcing that the girls have been liberated and have converted to Islam.\n\nThe majority of the abducted girls are believed to be Christians, although there are also some Muslims among them. Shekau also states in the video that he would release the girls in exchange for prisoners. There is no indication of when or where the video was recorded, but the location appears to be rural.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of trading the girls for imprisoned militants, U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Monday that this is up to Nigeria. \"As you know, Nigeria is in the lead. We are simply supporting their efforts. As you know also, the United States' policy is to deny kidnappers the benefits of their criminal acts, including ransoms or concessions,\" Psaki said at a press briefing.\n\nThe video received by the AP on Monday came through channels that have provided previous messages from Boko Haram leader Shekau. He is shown in military fatigues cradling an assault rifle on the video, which is imprinted with the Boko Haram insignia of a Koran resting on two crossed assault rifles and below the black Jihadi flag.\n\nThe United States put a $7 million bounty on Shekau's head last year. The video is the first sighting of the abducted girls since more than 300 were taken on April 14 from their school in the northern town of Chibok by Islamist militants. Although more than 50 girls have escaped their captors and are now safe, at least 276 remain missing.\n\nThe search for the missing girls has centered on the Sambisa forest, with Nigerian troops being aided by advisers from the U.S., Britain, and France. Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren clarified the U.S. presence in Nigeria for reporters on Monday, stating that there are more than 50 U.S. military personnel and advisors based at the Nigerian Embassy to help \"advise and assist\" in the search for the missing girls. The teams have expertise in \"communications, logistics, civil affairs, and intelligence.\"\n\nCol. Warren added that there are no plans to put additional U.S. military forces on the ground in Nigeria. When asked about the video, Psaki said U.S. intelligence agents are hoping to use it to help rescue the girls. \"We have no reason to question its authenticity. Our intelligence experts are combing through every detail of the video for clues that might help in ongoing efforts to secure the release of the girls,\" Psaki said.\n\nThe video emerged on Monday as the Nigerian government reportedly made \"indirect contact\" with the terrorist group. The report from Sky News did not specify how the two sides got in touch, but a special adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told Sky News that Nigeria would not pay to secure the girls' release, \"because the sale of human beings is a crime against humanity.\"\n\nThe Nigerian government has been heavily criticized for how it has conducted its search for the missing girls, who were taken after taking final exams. On Friday, the group Amnesty International claimed that Nigerian security forces were aware that a convoy of fighters from Boko Haram was approaching the town of Chibok four hours before the kidnapping, but did nothing to stop the kidnappings.\n\nIt is believed that 53 girls were able to escape the kidnappers. One of them, 19-year-old Sarah Lawan, told the Associated Press that her ordeal was \"too terrifying for words,\" and added that she was afraid to go back to school.\n\nBoko Haram, whose name, loosely translated, means \"Western education is forbidden,\" is believed to have killed approximately 1,500 people in Nigeria so far this year, and has been waging an insurgency in the country for the past five years. Shekau claimed credit for the abductions in a video last week, stating, \"I abducted your girls! By Allah, I will sell them in the marketplace!\"\n\nFormer Vice President of Nigeria Atiku Abubakar told Sky News, \"This is a clear case of mismanagement of a small group of bandits who have been allowed to really grow into a monstrous terrorist organization that we now have.\" The search has been made more difficult by the lack of information regarding the girls' possible whereabouts, with speculation suggesting that they have been split into four groups, with some believed to have been taken across Nigeria's border.\n\nMilitants have likely laid booby traps and landmines to prevent searchers from finding the girls. In addition, two bridges crossing Nigeria's borders with Chad and Cameroon have reportedly been destroyed in the past week.",
    " Title: Pro-Life Movement Shifts Focus as Pro-Choice Majority Takes Over U.S. House of Representatives\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As the U.S. Senate saw a growth in pro-life lawmakers on election night, pro-choice voters celebrated the transformation of the House of Representatives into a pro-choice majority. Mallory Quigley, a pro-life advocate with the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA), expressed her disappointment, stating, \"We can't get around the fact that this is certainly a loss for the pro-life movement, that the House, which has been a vanguard, is now going to be back in the hands of someone like Nancy Pelosi who is absolutely an abortion radical.\"\n\nWith the pro-life movement facing a setback in the House, pro-life activists like Quigley are refocusing their efforts on preventing tax dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. \"This is a fight that we have to take up, a mantle that we have to pick up every day,\" she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News during a recent interview at SBA headquarters just outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nSBA teams began door-to-door canvassing as early as July, making millions of visits to convince voters to support a pro-life Senate. \"What we wanted was not just a Republican Senate but a pro-life Senate. The Senate is ground zero for Supreme Court justices. We saw that with the fight to confirm Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh,\" Quigley said.\n\nWith a pro-choice majority in the House and a pro-life Senate, the confirmation of Supreme Court justices no longer hinges on the votes of pro-choice Republicans like Sens. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Susan Collins (ME).\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who remains the most pro-life president in American history, is still in office. In 2018, he spoke to tens of thousands of activists at the March for Life, stating, \"Every child is a precious gift from God.\" During his campaign, he sent a letter to pro-life voters outlining his actions to protect life if elected, and he has been keeping his word.\n\nIn the coming days, the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to finalize the \"Protect Life Rule,\" which will cut off $60 million in funding for Planned Parenthood, their second-largest source of funding. \"If they continue to do abortions, they won't get Title X money,\" Quigley explained.\n\nDespite the loss of a pro-life majority in the House, Quigley remains optimistic, stating, \"It's a very encouraging time to be pro-life.\" SBA teams across the country will soon begin door-to-door canvassing once again to rally the pro-life vote in 2020.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee's Impeachment Inquiry: A Divisive and Unpopular Move Amidst 2020 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing impeachment process of a president, often shrouded in parliamentary intricacies, consists of three straightforward steps. First, the House authorizes the Judiciary Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry. Next, the committee conducts an investigation to determine if the president has committed any offense warranting removal from office. Finally, if such evidence is discovered, the full House votes to approve one or more articles of impeachment.\n\nHowever, the Democrats, despite their accusations of wrongdoing at the White House, have been unable to garner enough votes in the House to initiate the first step toward impeaching President Trump. Consequently, Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has decided to conduct what some perceive as a \"fake\" impeachment inquiry.\n\nOver the weekend, CNN reported that the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to vote on a resolution outlining the procedures for its investigation. The vote, expected to occur on Wednesday, will establish the ground rules for conducting hearings now that the committee has publicly announced it is considering recommending articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nNadler's decision to bypass centuries of congressional precedent for impeachment is met with opposition from nearly half of the Democratic House caucus. Only 134 of the 235 Democratic representatives support the move, and many adamantly oppose it. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a presidential candidate, voiced her opposition, stating, \"I don't support impeachment... continuing to pursue impeachment is something that I think will only further tear our country apart.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's rules exclude Gabbard from the next presidential debate, reflecting her divergence from the far-left faction that is rapidly gaining influence within the party. However, she aligns with moderate Democrats, who are likely to bear the brunt of Nadler's plan to cater to the radical Left. Vulnerable Democrats and cautious consultants, aware that the GOP needs to flip only 18 seats in 2020 to regain control of the House, are wary of Nadler's \"inquiry\" potentially jeopardizing their re-election bids.\n\nLongtime Democratic consultant Douglas Schoen warns, \"It would be a profound mistake for Democrats to be goaded into pursuing impeachment... Getting distracted by impeachment will only impede our chances of developing a narrative that can defeat President Trump in 2020.\"\n\nMoreover, the electorate seems uninterested in the impeachment inquiry Nadler is pursuing. Since the Russia conspiracy theory's collapse, public opinion has shifted. Even dragging Robert Mueller before Congress failed to reignite public interest in that implausible tale. Every poll conducted since that spectacle has indicated that a majority of voters are against impeachment.\n\nThe latest Monmouth University Poll found little support for investigations and less for impeachment. Just over a third (35%) of Americans feel that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, while a clear majority (59%) disagree with this course of action. Furthermore, 41% of Americans view it as a good idea for the House Judiciary Committee to conduct an inquiry that may or may not lead to impeachment, but more (51%) consider this initial step a bad idea.\n\nThe question remains: what is Nadler's true intention? With a congressional career spanning three decades, is Nadler so consumed by his antipathy for President Trump that he disregards centuries of congressional precedent on impeachment, the risk of his party being perceived as beholden to a radical Left intent on undoing the 2016 election, and the will of the voters? Or is it that his decades-long sojourn in the Swamp has taught him the necessity of desperate measures, that something\u2014anything\u2014must be done to prevent Trump from being reelected while the GOP recaptures the few seats it needs to deprive the Democrats of their House majority?\n\nSen. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, expressed sympathy for Nadler, stating on Fox News that this is \"really pathetic... Nothing like this has ever happened in the House before.\" Collins suggested that the impeachment inquiry is a publicity stunt driven in part by Nadler's desire to avoid a primary challenge next year from the Left. Nadler knows his committee's recommendations will never reach the House floor for a vote. Perhaps his fake impeachment inquiry is about nothing more than defending his soft congressional seat.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Sharing Sensitive Information with Russian Officials, National Security Advisor Disputes Washington Post Report\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended his decision to share sensitive information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during a White House meeting last week. The president stated that he had the \"absolute right\" to reveal \"facts\" pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety for \"humanitarian reasons.\"\n\nIn his tweets, Trump wrote, \"As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's statement is in contrast to the one offered by his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, to reporters outside the West Wing on Monday night. McMaster denied that the president disclosed \"intelligence sources or methods,\" a claim that was not made in the Washington Post story.\n\n\"The story that came out tonight, as reported, is false,\" McMaster said. \"The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time \u2014 at no time \u2014 were intelligence sources or methods discussed.\"\n\nDina Powell, who serves as the deputy national security adviser for strategy, also denied the story in a statement, saying, \"This story is false. The president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Washington Post reported that in his meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump \"went off script and began describing details about an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.\"\n\n\"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,\" Trump said, according to the Washington Post report. Officials told the Post that the information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Accuses President Obama of Lying Over Tax Cut Claims Ahead of Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on ABC's \"This Week,\" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie accused President Barack Obama of lying regarding Mitt Romney's economic plan and the former Massachusetts governor's alleged desire to cut taxes for the wealthy.\n\nDuring the interview, Christie was asked how he would respond if he were debating the president during Wednesday's first presidential debate.\n\n\"Stop lying, Mr. President...Governor Romney is not talking about more tax cuts for the wealthy. In fact, what he said is that the wealthy will pay just as much under a Romney administration as they pay today,\" Christie stated.\n\nChristie went on to criticize the Obama campaign's advertisement, which accused Romney of wanting to implement policies that led to the 2008 financial crisis and of supporting trickle-down economics.\n\nWhite House senior adviser David Plouffe, who was contacted after the interview, called the accusation that the president was lying \"not true.\"\n\n\"Strong words and not true. Listen, analysts have looked at this. Someone who makes over $3 million a year would get over a $250,000 tax cut if Governor Romney's plan were to be enacted,\" Plouffe said.\n\nPlouffe also emphasized that the Romney tax plan would result in an $8 trillion reduction in taxes, including a $2 trillion increase in defense spending and another $1 trillion to extend all the Bush tax cuts.\n\n\"The notion that somehow by closing loopholes for the wealthy that the middle class is going to be held harmless - you know, the middle class needs to understand, if - if Mitt Romney wins this presidential election, they're going to be paying the bill, not to reduce the deficit, not to reduce jobs, but to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy,\" Plouffe said.\n\nBoth Christie and Plouffe expressed confidence in their respective candidates' performances during the debate, with Christie predicting that Romney would \"come through\" and perform well, while Plouffe stated that the president would lay out his plan for the next four years.\n\nThe debate is set to take place on Wednesday, October 3.",
    " Title: Mueller's Statement on Trump Not Being a 'Criminal Target' Does Not Clear President of Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly informed President Trump's legal team in March that the president is not a \"criminal target\" of the Russia investigation but merely a \"subject\" in the probe. However, legal experts emphasize that this does not mean Trump is out of the woods regarding the Russia investigation.\n\nBeing labeled a \"subject\" indicates that Mueller is investigating Trump's conduct for evidence of a crime but has no immediate plans to bring charges. This is a less severe classification than a \"target,\" which refers to someone believed to have committed a crime and whom investigators are likely planning to bring charges against.\n\nAndrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, stated, \"Being a subject is better than being a target of a criminal investigation by a federal grand jury, but it is cold comfort. In effect, Robert Mueller told the Trump legal team that he is investigating the president's conduct but has not determined as yet whether the president has committed specific federal crimes.\"\n\nThe context of Mueller's \"criminal target\" comments is crucial, as they were made in relation to a potential Mueller interview of Trump under oath. Mueller's staff has expressed interest in questioning Trump about his reasons for firing FBI Director James Comey and his knowledge of contacts between his team and Russian officials.\n\nTrump himself reportedly wants to sit down with Mueller's staff, and his legal team is divided over whether it's a good idea. Saying that Trump isn't a target doesn't impede Mueller's investigation into his conduct, and might increase the chances of Trump agreeing to an interview.\n\nMiriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former federal prosecutor, explained, \"It's important to stress the fluidity between categories. Depending on the prosecutor's case, a subject can very quickly become a target (and although less likely, a target might for some reason morph back into a subject).\"\n\nMueller's reported insistence on interviewing Trump before he can finish his investigation, combined with Trump's history of exaggerating and lying during testimony, raises concerns about Trump's credibility under oath. In 2007, Trump was forced to sit for a deposition in a lawsuit brought by journalist Timothy O'Brien, who claimed Trump was only worth about $250 million. Trump disputed the number, but O'Brien's lawyers caught Trump lying 30 times during the deposition.\n\nThis history of dishonesty could make it challenging for Trump to avoid exaggerations or lies during testimony for the Russia investigation. Mueller has already charged five people with lying during interviews with the FBI, including Alex van der Zwaan, who received a one-month sentence for lying on Tuesday. Even if Mueller can't charge Trump criminally, lying under oath is what led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.",
    " Title: House to Discontinue NSA Phone Data Collection Program as Perceived by Lawmaker Who Authored USA Patriot Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the House of Representatives is expected to discontinue the National Security Agency (NSA) phone data collection program, as per the statements made by Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who authored the USA Patriot Act in 2001. Sensenbrenner indicated that the House will not renew the provisions of the act that allow the government to collect data from businesses without a warrant, effectively ending the program by the end of 2015.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, both Democrats and Republicans expressed their rejection of President Obama's claim that the law allows the intelligence community to collect phone numbers, time, date, and duration of calls made by Americans. They urged the president to change the way the program operates if he wants to keep it intact.\n\nSensenbrenner stated that Congress specifically tried to limit the law's uses when it renewed the provisions under Section 215 of the act. However, he argued that the intelligence community has expanded, not limited, its data-gathering efforts after Congress tried to rein them in.\n\n\"Section 215 expires at the end of 2015, and unless you realize you've got a problem, that is not going to be renewed,\" Sensenbrenner said. \"It's got to be changed, and you have to change how you operate Section 215. Otherwise, in a year or a year and a half, you're not going to have it anymore.\"\n\nThe revelation of the NSA's phone data collection program, following former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden's leak of details last month, has sparked a major debate in Congress. Administration officials who testified during Wednesday's hearing did little to assuage concerns, acknowledging that they had the technology to track ATM transactions and the ability to track the locations of cellphones on which they're already gathering metadata.\n\nLawmakers expressed their concerns about the administration's handling of the program, with some accusing the administration of trying to hide it. The administration officials, however, maintained that they were not trying to hide the program and are working to provide Congress with the secret court opinions that underpin the program, as well as reports on how the data collection is performed and how it is used.\n\nIn a letter to Sensenbrenner this week, Peter J. Kadzik, principal deputy assistant attorney general, outlined the administration's reasoning for the program's justification. Kadzik argued that the bulk collection of telephony metadata is necessary to identify the smaller subset of terrorist-related telephony metadata records contained within the data, and to make connections related to terrorist activities over time.\n\nUnder the terms of the program, phone companies turn over the data, which the government stores for five years. However, officials said they can query the data to look for specific numbers only if they have a \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" that someone is involved with terrorism.\n\nThe administration officials also stated that they involve all three branches of government by regularly briefing some congressional committees about the program, going through rigorous review within the executive branch, and seeking approval for collecting the data from the special secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court every 90 days.\n\nHowever, members of Congress expressed their preference for judges to sign off before anyone goes digging through all of the information, rather than leaving that decision to 22 employees at the NSA. The debate over the NSA's phone data collection program is expected to continue in the coming months as the end of 2015 approaches.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Raise Concerns Over Marijuana Legalization and International Obligations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Attorney General Eric Holder, Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) have expressed their concerns over the Obama administration's decision to allow states like Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia to legalize recreational marijuana. The senators argue that this decision violates federal law and U.S. obligations under the United Nations Convention on Narcotics.\n\nIn the letter, sent on Jan. 6, the senators stated that the Department of Justice's decision to defer its right to challenge legalization laws to the states has put the United States in a difficult position regarding its compliance with international treaties. They believe that the nation's position as a global leader against drugs has been weakened by this decision.\n\nThe senators have set a deadline of Feb. 1 for Kerry to clarify the State Department's interpretation of the treaties. Their concerns are shared by United Nations officials, who have spoken out after Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield called for a \"flexible interpretation\" of UN Drug Control Conventions last October.\n\nIn 2013, the Justice Department issued a clarification of federal drug policy, stating that it would defer its right to challenge legalization laws to the states. Sen. Grassley said in a press release about the letters that this approach \"threatens to weaken U.S. standing as an international leader on drug control issues and may undermine the international treaties the United States and other countries have signed.\"\n\nAfter the November elections, Yury Fedotov, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, stated that he did not \"see how [the new laws] can be compatible with existing conventions.\"\n\nTom Angell, founder of the Marijuana Majority, agrees with the senators that there is an inconsistency. He told The Washington Post, \"When the U.S. has legal marijuana, it makes it difficult for U.S. officials to go around the world and say they should continue to prohibit marijuana.\" Angell also agrees with the senators' request for the Justice Department to put together, by Feb. 15, a plan to compile information on the impact of legalization \"disaggregated by state and comparable over time, so that data before and after the legalization of marijuana can be compared.\"\n\nFeinstein and Grassley, who serve as co-chairs of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, have worked together before on anti-drug efforts and released a report in December outlining recommendations on ways to counter illicit activities and corruption surrounding the Afghan drug trade.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda's Resurgence: Experts Warn of Persistent Threat Despite US Embassy Closures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and the absence of Al Qaeda-orchestrated terrorist attacks on US soil since 9/11, some Americans may have been lulled into believing that Al Qaeda is no longer a significant threat. However, the recent extension of US embassy and consulate closures across the Middle East and Africa, as well as the increasing focus on Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, has led many terrorism experts to caution that claims of Al Qaeda's retreat or even demise may have been premature.\n\nFactors such as the post-Arab Spring chaos in the Middle East and the Obama administration's drone-strike wars in Pakistan and Yemen have contributed to a different but no less lethal Al Qaeda than the one that attacked the US on its soil 12 years ago. Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal, which tracks and analyzes the \"global war on terror,\" states, \"Those who have been claiming Al Qaeda has been defeated or is on its death bed either have bad analysis or have been dishonest with the American people.\"\n\nRoggio cites the regions where Al Qaeda has active affiliates, many of which the US government says are expanding in size and reach, and asks, \"How can you have a group that's expanding its footprint and is adding fighters where it's established, and say it's being defeated?\"\n\nTerrorism analyst Bruce Riedel, director of the Brookings Institution's Intelligence Project, agrees that the \"old\" Al Qaeda with its core leadership in Pakistan has been \"depleted\" in recent years. However, he adds that the setbacks the group has suffered at its center have been largely offset by the opportunities that opened up elsewhere as a result of upheaval across the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nRiedel points to the recent large jailbreaks by Al Qaeda prisoners in Iraq, Pakistan, and Libya, and adds that such actions in rapid succession, coming on top of the past month's spike in Al Qaeda-originating violence in Iraq and successes in Syria, can't help but suggest Al Qaeda's resurgence.\n\nSome terrorism experts argue that the new Al Qaeda affiliates are focused on local insurgencies and local goals, such as establishing strict Islamist states in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. However, Riedel and others caution against drawing that conclusion. Riedel states, \"I think we have to take Al Qaeda's leadership and the leaders of the affiliates at their word, and reading what they say, they say they have a global agenda.\"\n\nRiedel also cites last January's deadly attack by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) on an Algerian gas plant, one of AQIM's reasons for attacking the plant being the large number of Western workers there. The Long War Journal's Roggio notes that it was less than four years ago that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) dispatched a terrorist who attempted to detonate a bomb in his underwear on a flight over Detroit. \"Had that bomb gone off over Detroit,\" Roggio says, \"would we even be having this conversation about whether or not Al Qaeda still wants to attack the US?\"\n\nSome terrorism experts point to the closings of US diplomatic facilities across the Middle East and parts of Africa and cite that as evidence that a weakened Al Qaeda has of necessity pulled back to attempting to hit targets in the region where it remains active. However, Roggio responds to such arguments by citing Al Qaeda's track record, in particular between the group's first attempt at a strike on the World Trade Center in 1993 and the attack of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nRoggio cautions that a similar \"if-at-first-you-don't-succeed\" motivation could be part of efforts by a Saudi citizen thought to be AQAP's chief bomb maker to devise ingenious new ways to get bombs (and suicide bombers) past the best security to the heart of key US interests. The Saudi, Ibrahim al-Asiri, whose fingerprints were found on the \"underwear bomb\" that failed to detonate over Detroit, is thought to be experimenting with new failsafe bombs\u2014to be surgically implanted in the suicide bomber, for example\u2014and to be training a class of bomb makers to take over for him should the US succeed in taking him out with a drone strike.\n\nBrookings' Riedel sounds another cautionary note for Americans who might have thought Al Qaeda was a threat of the past. He notes that much of the success at \"depleting\" Al Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan is a result of US pressure, but he notes that whatever success the US has had could quickly be reversed if that pressure subsides as a result of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from next-door Afghanistan at the end of 2014. Reduce the US presence and focus, Riedel says, and we can expect a rapid regeneration of Al Qaeda in Pakistan. And no one has much doubt about where Al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan would like to carry out a successful attack.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support for CARES Act Highlights Lack of Ideological Differences in U.S. Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the $2 trillion CARES Act, the largest spending bill in U.S. history, passed with unanimous support in the Senate, and near-unanimous support in the House of Representatives. The bill, aimed at providing relief to families and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, was passed on a voice vote in the House, shielding members from having to go on record supporting it.\n\nOne of the few dissenters was Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan independent who left the Republican Party last summer due to philosophical differences. Amash, who consistently criticized the CARES Act for favoring corporations over individuals, officially submitted a no vote on Friday.\n\nIn response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) tweeted, \"Congressman Justin Amash officially submitted his 'no' vote in the congressional record on the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that puts # FamiliesFirst amid the COVID-19 pandemic. # MI03. 'During a national crisis, it's unfortunate that Congressman Justin Amash would once again adhere to an extreme, out-of-touch ideology, even when it means risking the health, well-being, and economic security of thousands of # MI03.'\"\n\nThirty minutes later, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) tweeted, \"Congressman Justin Amash officially submitted his 'no' vote in the congressional record on the bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that puts # FamiliesFirst amid the COVID-19 pandemic. # MI03. 'During a national crisis, it's unfortunate that Congressman Justin Amash would once again work against President Trump, even when it means risking the health, well-being, and economic security of thousands of # MI03.'\"\n\nIn response to the tweets, Amash replied, \"There's about as much independent thinking here as there is in Congress.\"\n\nThe response to Amash's dissent highlights a striking lack of ideological differences between the two major parties, as both the DCCC and NRCC criticized Amash for his vote, despite their political differences. This trend of bipartisan spending, which has been consistent since the turn of the century, raises questions about the level of polarization in U.S. politics.\n\nIn an interview, Rep. Thomas Massie, who attempted to force a recorded vote on the CARES Act, discussed the bipartisan anger directed his way, \"We're constantly being told that we live in increasingly and uniquely polarized times, when the differences between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, have never been more pronounced or stark. And yet by the most basic measure of government\u2014spending\u2014we have effectively been living under one-party rule for the entire 21st century.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirms William Barr as Attorney General, Setting Stage for Oversight of Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general on Thursday, installing a seasoned lawyer with decades of Washington experience to head the Justice Department and oversee Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-running probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Senate voted 54 to 45, largely along party lines. A Justice Department spokeswoman said Barr will be sworn in at 4:45 PM ET in the Oval Office of the White House by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe confirmation comes amid concerns from many Democrats that Barr might not make Mueller's findings fully public. However, with the Senate controlled by President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans, Barr's confirmation was virtually assured.\n\n\"Today is a great day for the Department of Justice with the confirmation of William Barr to be the next Attorney General,\" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. \"He is a steady hand at a time of turmoil and he will bring much-needed reform to the Department of Justice.\"\n\nPreviously attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush, Barr has won praise from lawmakers in both parties for his expertise and grasp of the workings of the Justice Department.\n\nBarr will be the third man to occupy that post in barely two years, replacing acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who replaced Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump ousted Sessions last November after criticizing him repeatedly.\n\nMueller is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and whether Moscow colluded with Trump's campaign to try to tilt the election in Trump's favor, as well as possible obstruction of justice.\n\nBefore being nominated, Barr wrote a 19-page legal memo, in which he called part of Mueller's probe into whether the president obstructed justice \"fatally flawed.\" He shared it with Trump's legal team and Justice Department officials.\n\nBarr has said he will not let himself be bullied by Trump and will protect the integrity of Mueller's investigation and make public as many of its findings as he can. Barr has not promised to release Mueller's report in its entirety. He has warned he may not be allowed to reveal the identities of people who escape prosecution. That stance troubles many Democrats, who say Barr's expansive views of executive power might lead him to suppress parts of the report.\n\n\"The Justice Department needs a leader who will be independent of the White House and who is able to stand up to President Trump,\" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a statement. \"Bill Barr hasn't demonstrated that he would be that independent leader.\"\n\nDespite Democrats' opposition, many were anxious to have Barr installed quickly so he would replace Whitaker, whose tenure has been fraught with controversy since Trump appointed him in November. Critics have alleged Whitaker's appointment was unlawful. Democrats fear Trump installed Whitaker to undermine Mueller's probe because Whitaker had criticized it when he was a conservative pundit.\n\nBarr is widely expected to back many of Trump's tough immigration policies. He will also be under the microscope for how he implements a new law that eases prison sentences for non-violent criminals, after he advocated for the opposite, tough-on-crime approach for decades.",

Six-week rookie Officer Aurash Zarkeshan remains in critical condition after also being shot in the head during the same incident.\n\nWhile CBS Evening News provided a brief 16-second news update on Monday, the incident was not mentioned again, even after the death of Sgt. Johnson and the critical condition of Officer Zarkeshan. NBC News did not report on the incident, and their website did not feature a written report, raising questions about their decision to withhold the news. ABC News, however, did report on the incident, with Christina Carrega providing a detailed account of the events leading up to the shooting in an online report.\n\nAccording to Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin, the incident occurred when the suspect refused to comply with officers' commands to step out of his car. Sgt. Johnson displayed a stun gun and asked the suspect to exit the car 12 times before firing. A struggle ensued, and the suspect pulled out a gun and fired \"several shots at close range,\" striking both officers in the head.\n\nSadly, Sgt. Johnson, who leaves behind a wife and two young sons, passed away on Tuesday afternoon. Officer Zarkeshan remains in critical condition.\n\nRetired Dallas police officer C' Mone Wingo, speaking on Wednesday morning's Fox and Friends, expressed her condolences for the slaying and lamented the increasing demonization of police officers in society. Wingo emphasized the hard work and dedication of officers who risk their lives to protect and serve their communities.\n\nMeanwhile, the networks have been promoting efforts to \"defund the police,\" and have criticized President Trump's support for the police. NBC News scoffed at the increasing targeting of police officers in attacks, and decried President Trump's continued defense of the police as an \"unusual step.\"\n\nCBS's brief news update and lack of follow-up coverage has raised questions about the network's decision to withhold more detailed information about the incident.

    " Title: Jared Kushner Fined for Late Financial Disclosure by U.S. Government\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been fined $200 by the U.S. government for failing to disclose recent financial transactions on time as required by federal law. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) ordered Mr. Kushner to pay the fine for failing to timely notify the government of transactions that occurred in February involving JCK Cadre LLC, a holding company in his name with a stake in a successful New York tech startup.\n\nAccording to a report by McClatchy, at least 18 members of the Trump administration filed late financial disclosure statements with the ethics office this year, with Mr. Kushner among them. The report also stated that former chief of staff Reince Priebus was four days late with his filing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was 23 days behind with her own paperwork, and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was more than a month tardy in filing his personal financial disclosure statement. Christopher Ford, a member of the president's National Security Council, filed his 46 days behind schedule, according to the report.\n\nHarrell Kirstein, a spokesperson for the Democratic opposition research firm American Bridge, which collected the data, told McClatchy, \"President Trump acts like the rules for the rest of us don't apply to him, and now his entire administration is doing the same.\"\n\nIndividuals required to file financial disclosure statements with the government are typically subject to fines if they are 30 days late in doing so, though fees are sometimes waived. Mr. Kushner, on his part, failed to disclose on time a pair of transactions from February 17 involving JCK Cadre each valued at between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nThe federal government assessed fees last year on just 3.6 percent of the 12,000 staffers who filed late periodic transaction reports, making Mr. Kushner's penalty a rare occurrence, McClatchy reported. The White House declined to comment on the record, but a Trump administration official familiar with the matter told McClatchy that Mr. Kushner will pay the fine.\n\nMr. Kushner, 36, married the president's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, in 2009. Combined, the couple disclosed assets valued at between $206 million and $760 million in separate disclosures filed with the OGE last month. In a statement following last month's filings, their attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said, \"Jared and Ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Grants Unprecedented Access to Bergdahl Family During Son's Captivity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration granted unprecedented access to the parents of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, allowing them to participate in a series of secure video conferences with senior military and government officials during their son's five-year captivity in Afghanistan. This level of involvement, according to a former government official, is unique in hostage recovery cases, and raises questions about the potential disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nThe Bergdahls, residents of Hailey, Idaho, were given access to secure video conferences with representatives from U.S. Central Command, the White House, the State Department, and intelligence agencies. These meetings, which occurred quarterly or up to 20 times over the five-year period, provided the Bergdahls with updates on the search for their missing son.\n\nRobert Bergdahl, Sgt. Bergdahl's father, has publicly expressed concern for prisoners at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In a controversial move, the U.S. released five senior Taliban commanders on May 31, 2014, in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl, who was held by the violent Haqqani Network, a Taliban ally.\n\nAir Force Col. Timothy Marsano, spokesman for Idaho's National Guard, confirmed that the Bergdahls participated in these video conferences. He stated, \"Mr. and Mrs. Bergdahl were regularly informed about what was happening throughout the duration using video teleconferencing [with] various military and other government agencies.\"\n\nThe Bergdahls' involvement in these discussions has raised concerns from some, including Larry Johnson, a former State Department official who worked on American hostage issues in the 1980s. Johnson stated, \"It's wrong... The Bergdahls shouldn't have been part of that for no other reason than on the off chance they may inadvertently divulge some tactic.\"\n\nCol. Marsano, who has served as the family's spokesman, denied any breach of sensitive information. He stated, \"I certainly don't know of anything like that happening.\" However, he declined to discuss whether classified matters arose or whether the couple had a security clearance.\n\nSgt. Bergdahl is currently undergoing the military's reintegration process, which includes debriefings on his captivity. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance in 2009 and his eventual release remain a subject of controversy, with some accusing him of desertion.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Engage in Budget Battle, as Ted Cruz Leads Conservative Faction Against Debt Limit Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is currently embroiled in a contentious budget battle, with a rift emerging between the old and new guard, the mainstream and the tea party, and Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz at the forefront. This internal conflict is causing a significant stir within the Republican Party, as the typically unified Republicans find themselves airing their dirty laundry in public rather than behind closed doors.\n\nSenator Cruz, along with a group of Senate conservatives, is refusing to engage in budget negotiations with the House, instead engaging in open combat with more senior Republicans like McCain who are perplexed by their hardball tactics. This unusual public discord has left Cruz increasingly isolated from many of his colleagues, and has placed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a precarious position.\n\nMcConnell must navigate between the conservative firebrands, who hold significant influence from the right and could potentially run for president in 2016, and ending the internal feud that is proving to be a distraction for the party. The current situation mirrors the tea party versus establishment fights that have disrupted Senate primaries in recent years, but this time, the battles are unfolding on the Senate floor.\n\nGOP leaders are currently in a state of uncertainty, unsure of how the situation will resolve itself. At present, it remains unclear who will emerge victorious, but more Republicans appear to favor initiating conference talks rather than blocking them, although the voices in favor of the latter may be more vocal.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican and Cruz's Texas colleague, stated, \"I'm just watching,\" even as Cornyn favors beginning conference talks. Cruz is not alone in his fight, which he describes as an effort to prevent a debt limit increase from being added to the budget talks. He has been leading the charge alongside fellow tea party Senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nThe ongoing budget battle also serves as a glimpse into the 2016 primary politics that are shaping the Senate, with Rubio, Cruz, and Paul all considered likely contenders for the presidential bid. On Wednesday, Cruz took the fight to his own party, stating that he does not \"trust\" Republicans to resolve the country's fiscal problems or avoid including an increase to the debt ceiling.\n\nThe controversy began after Senate Democrats passed a budget in March, their first such plan in four years. Following this, Democrats sought to initiate conference negotiations with House Republicans, who passed their own budget by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). A conference is part of the regular order that the GOP has long demanded. However, Senate conservatives objected to Majority Leader Harry Reid's attempt to begin the proceedings, demanding written assurances to exclude tax hikes and a debt limit increase from the negotiations.\n\nAs the budget battle continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how this internal conflict will impact the Republican Party and the ongoing budget negotiations.",
    " Title: Obama and Top Democrats Push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform as House Shifts Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Obama and his top Democrats on Capitol Hill are advocating for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform by the Republican-controlled House, rather than the piecemeal approach that had previously been suggested. This shift comes as lawmakers prepare to take a break for the Christmas holiday.\n\nDuring a year-end press conference on Friday, President Obama urged the House to support the bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate passed in the summer. This stance appears to be a departure from recent comments where Obama seemed to support the House's apparent piecemeal plan.\n\n\"The Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country,\" Obama said. \"So let's go ahead and get that done.\"\n\nIn contrast to his previous statements in November, where he expressed no issue with the House leaders dividing the immigration bill into several parts, Obama this week stated, \"As long as all five pieces get done, I don't care what it looks like. What we do not want to do is simply carve out one piece of it...but leave behind some of the tougher stuff that still needs to get done.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has consistently stated that he will not schedule a vote on the Senate bill nor negotiate with Senate Democrats on the upper chamber's legislation. \"We have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill,\" Boehner said last month.\n\nAlthough the House has yet to vote on any part of an immigration bill, the chamber seems to be primarily concerned with securing the U.S.-Mexico border and not including a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada, suggested this weekend that Boehner may negotiate on comprehensive reform next year. Reid also hinted that House members facing reelection in Democratic-leaning or middle-of-the-road districts might need to vote for immigration reform.\n\nHowever, any bill perceived by conservatives as too lenient on border security and too lenient on legalization is likely to face strong opposition from outspoken Republican Party members such as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Iowa Rep. Steve King, and South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.\n\nEven Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party-backed lawmaker who co-sponsored the bill, now appears to favor a more piecemeal approach. A Rubio spokesman stated this fall, \"The most realistic way to make progress on immigration would be through a series of individual bills.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Eye State-Level Races for Rebuilding and Rebranding Ahead of 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Party is looking to state-level races as a means to rebuild and rebrand ahead of the 2020 elections. With the Democrats facing a challenging congressional midterm landscape, they are focusing on state-level races to cultivate new leadership and policy ideas.\n\nThirty-eight governorships are up for election in the next two years, providing fertile ground for new Democratic faces and ideas to emerge. In 16 states, including the swing states of Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and Michigan, Republican governors will step down due to term limits or retirement, leaving open-seat races. New Mexico, Maine, and New Jersey \u2013 all blue states with Republican governors \u2013 will be electing new chief executives in the next two years.\n\nWinning a slew of governorships could bring a new generation of party leaders into the spotlight and help rebrand the Democratic Party. Governors can operate autonomously from Washington, and pursue new policy ideas that bolster a party image of innovation.\n\n\"In governors, people see a leader. They can pursue fresh policies that spread quickly around the country,\" says Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association (DGA). \"There is a lot of opportunity to be on the offense here [in 2018]\u2026 Governors quickly become the stars of their party.\"\n\nMany of America's recent presidents, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush, served first as governors. After the 2008 election, Republicans found themselves in the same position that Democrats now face. Barack Obama had won the presidency, and Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. But within the next two years, conservatives came back to take 11 governorships out of Democratic hands. And this year, Republicans won the presidency as well as majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n\"Republicans rebuilt after 2008 by electing new governors who pushed policies and had a story to tell,\" says Mr. Leopold. \"Governorships are the best way to quickly rebuild and inject fresh blood.\"\n\nRepublican governors elected to their first term in 2010 made a name for themselves in the conservative field. Ohio Gov. John Kasich took his state from a $6 billion deficit to a $2 billion surplus. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached an approval rating of 77 percent after helping his state through superstorm Sandy, before his reputation was tainted by the Bridgegate scandal. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker cut his state's unemployment rate by almost half \u2013 though that largely mirrored national trends.\n\nGovernorships are the perfect means to audition a new party message, says Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who chairs the DGA. This could be especially helpful in the Midwest, where many Democrats worry the Republican Party has found a new stronghold with the white working class.\n\n\"Gubernatorial campaigns by their very nature take that one on,\" Governor Malloy told Politico. \"If you're running for governor, you are going to get known and visit every community. It's very personal ownership, and people want to know you. That doesn't mean there won't be close elections, but it's different.\"\n\nGovernors Kasich, Christie, and Walker's successes also served the conservative cause in a more obvious way: They added to the party's list of credible presidential candidates in 2016.\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs some stars, some younger faces to advance their issues and to be potential national candidates in 2020 and beyond,\" says John Weingart, director of Rutgers University's Center on the American Governor in New Jersey.\n\nDuring Mr. Obama's tenure, Democrats have not only lost 12 governorships, dropping from 28 in January 2009 to 16 in January 2017; they have also lost more than 950 state legislative seats to Republicans since Obama took office, the largest net loss for either party since World War II.\n\n\"Obama paid no attention to party development as president, and the results have been disastrous,\" says William Crotty, an emeritus professor of political science at Northeastern University in Boston. \"His record in this regard is terrible.\"\n\nThe number of Democratic governors and state legislators over the next few years may be more important than ever. When the next census is held in 2020, state legislatures \u2013 and to some extent governors \u2013 will lead the subsequent redrawing of congressional districts. Success for Democrats at the state level is \"essential,\" adds Mr. Weingart.\n\nBut for Democrats to reap the rewards of state-level wins at the national level, party donors and voters need to invest in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"The trouble is that very few people find state politics compelling,\" writes The Week's Paul Waldman. \"It can be hard to care about what happens at the minor league ballpark when the World Series is going on... But it's necessary.\"",
    " Title: \" The State of the U.S. Economy: A Look at the Current Economic Expansion and Its Origins\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address last week, President Donald Trump highlighted the strength of the U.S. economy, stating that it is the best it has ever been. While some may question the boldness of this claim, there is no denying that, by certain metrics, the economy is indeed booming.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently in the midst of the longest expansion in American history, having continued to grow from the dark days of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the stock market has reached record levels.\n\nThe strong economy may be one of the most powerful arguments Trump has as he campaigns for a second term. Historically, voters tend to reward incumbents for a strong economy and punish them for a weak one. The last two presidents to lose reelection, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, were defeated during periods of economic decline.\n\nTrump's supporters credit his policies, including the trillion-dollar tax cut and trade battles with China, Mexico, and others, for boosting investment and creating jobs in the U.S. Trump's detractors, on the other hand, argue that the gains made in the past three years are merely an extension of the progress made by President Barack Obama. They point out that Obama prevented another depression and built a solid foundation on which the current economic expansion has grown. Some also argue that Trump's policies, such as tax cuts and increased spending, could ultimately destabilize the economy.\n\nAnother group contends that the economy is not doing as well as it may seem, with most of the gains being experienced by the wealthy while the working class falls further behind.\n\nThough the economy is still growing, the rate of that growth slowed last year to the lowest levels in the Trump presidency. Whether this is a sign that the economic upswing is reaching its peak is unclear. Economies can't grow forever, and another recession will come eventually.\n\nEconomists and political analysts offer a range of perspectives on the Trump administration's economic policies. Some, like Andy Puzder of the Washington Post, argue that Trump's policies have finally produced the economic benefits that American workers should have experienced coming out of the recession but did not. Others, such as Sasha Abramsky of The Nation, contend that poverty rates are falling not because of GOP tax cuts and deregulation, but because of Democratic-controlled cities and states raising the minimum wage and increasing access to health insurance.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic metrics Trump boasts about are, in large part, continuations of trends that started during the Obama administration, suggesting that the country has been climbing out of a recession for many years, not that Trump's policies were necessarily transformative. The debate over the impact of Trump's economic policies will likely continue as the 2020 election approaches.",
    " Title: Heroic Teacher Michael Landsberry Saves Lives in Deadly Shooting Incident at Sparks Middle School\n\nAuthorities have yet to reveal the identity of the shooter who took the life of popular math teacher Michael Landsberry and wounded two students at Sparks Middle School on Monday morning. Landsberry, a 45-year-old teacher, was hailed as a hero for his actions that saved numerous lives by confronting the gunman and allowing students to escape the scene.\n\nAccording to Michael Mieras, Chief of the Washoe County School District, Landsberry, a former Marine and member of the Army National Guard, began his teaching career in 2001 and joined Sparks Middle School in 2006. Landsberry was not only \"very respected by his peers\" but also held a significant influence among the students, serving as the coach for the boys' basketball and girls' volleyball teams.\n\nDuring a Tuesday afternoon press conference, Chief Mieras described Landsberry's actions as heroic. He \"calmly walked toward the shooter\" and \"put his hands up in a motion to stop [the shooter's] actions,\" preventing further harm to students. The shooter, who killed himself after shooting Landsberry and two students, was not identified by authorities.\n\nOne student was shot in the shoulder, while another was struck in the abdomen. Law enforcement did not fire any shots during the incident, authorities confirmed. The motive behind the shooting remains unclear as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA Facebook page, Remembering Mr. Michael Landsberry, has been created to honor the slain teacher. Tributes pour in from students and parents, expressing gratitude for Landsberry's selfless actions. Mari Cazares wrote, \"He is a true H.E.R.O in my book and always will be!\" while Stacey Bergman Mills added, \"Mr. Landsberry is a true American Hero!\"\n\nThe community mourns the loss of a dedicated teacher and a hero, as the investigation into the shooting continues.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Controversial Tweet on Kavanaugh and the Phenomenon of Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent tweet, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stirred controversy by claiming that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh referred to birth-control pills as \"abortion-inducing drugs\" during his confirmation hearings. This claim, however, has been widely debunked.\n\nClinton's tweet, which set off alarm bells for many, was met with criticism as it was seen as a deliberate distortion of Kavanaugh's words. The Washington Post's fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, gave Clinton four Pinocchios, the worst rating, stating that Kavanaugh was quoting the views of the plaintiffs in a specific case, not offering a personal view. Even PolitiFact, known for often bending its findings to fit a liberal narrative, ruled that the characterization was dishonest.\n\nThe question arises, why did Clinton make this claim, especially given that it had been widely debunked earlier? One plausible theory is that Clinton deliberately lied to pander to her base and further unfairly demonize Kavanaugh. Another theory is that Clinton may not have been paying attention, and her staff was incompetent, failing to do their due diligence.\n\nHowever, there may be another factor at play. In today's media climate, many people define themselves by what they hate. For many partisans, what motivates them the most isn't support for their side's policies but their hatred of the other party. This dynamic doesn't just apply to presidential candidates; it saturates both parties and both sides of the culture war.\n\nIn a media climate where every news outlet is essentially a niche product, appealing to a relatively small slice of the market, one of the best ways to get attention and support is to be attacked by the other side. This is the broader context for the often-lucrative vocation commonly known as \"trolling.\" Say or do something awful to get the other side to attack you, and your own side will rush to your support on the grounds that if you're making the right people angry, you're a hero.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska highlighted this phenomenon in a conversation with the author on his podcast, The Remnant. Sasse stated that cable-news producers and magazine editors have told him that there's \"no chance in hell that you're getting a 70 percent audience from anything anymore. What you want is a deep and sticky 1 percent audience.\" Sasse pointed out that one of the most effective ways to achieve this is by getting attacked, as it draws visibility to oneself.\n\nThis dynamic is everywhere today, particularly in the president's Twitter feed and in the Twitter feeds of various Democrats who'd like to replace him. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for Americans, according to Sasse. The ability to interpret objective data is distorted by political affiliation, as shown in a report by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The moment Democrats saw a Republican logo, the ability to interpret a chart went out the window for many of them, and vice-versa.\n\nIn conclusion, Clinton's tweet about Kavanaugh can be seen as an example of this phenomenon, where making a controversial statement to provoke the other side can lead to increased support from one's own side. This dynamic is a significant factor in today's political climate and is worth understanding for all Americans.",
    " Title: House Republicans Unveil Government Spending Bill, Aiming to Avoid Shutdown and Prioritize Defense and Veterans Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - House Republicans unveiled a government spending bill on Monday that aims to keep federal agencies funded through September and avoid a potential government shutdown. The bill, drafted by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Kentucky), lessens the impact of forced spending cuts for the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs, while federal agencies will run out of money on March 27.\n\nThe bill, known as a \"continuing resolution\" or \"CR,\" cuts roughly $10 billion from procurement and other areas to beef up the Defense Department's \"operations and maintenance\" account to ensure funding for military readiness and training programs. The bill also protects some other agencies from across-the-board budget cuts that took effect on Friday, keeping FBI and border security staffing at current levels and increasing funding for embassy security by $2 billion.\n\nThe bill, which keeps federal programs at last year's spending levels, will result in a drop in federal spending to $982 billion, down from the trillion-dollar level. \"The legislation will avoid a government shutdown on March 27, prioritize DoD and Veterans programs, and allow the Pentagon some leeway to do its best with the funding it has,\" Rogers said in a written statement.\n\nDemocrats are expected to try to amend the House bill to soften the impact of the spending cuts on some domestic programs. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland), who chairs the Appropriations Committee, has stated her priorities, including housing, education, health care, transportation, and infrastructure.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey (D-New York), the top Democrat on the House spending panel, supports the military spending plans but is disappointed that the bill \"would lock most of the federal government into outdated plans and spending levels.\" Lowey argues that non-defense agencies will be hurt by the bill and urged Senate Democrats to work on a spending bill that protects those programs.\n\nThe White House has yet to comment on the House GOP bill, with Chief White House spokesman Jay Carney stating that the administration wants to see a practical and nonpolitical bill consistent with the levels established in the Budget Control Act. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also declined to comment on the bill, but expressed hope that the Senate will consider and pass a 2013 funding package that better reflects the needs and priorities of the American people.\n\nIt remains unclear whether House GOP conservatives will go along with the proposal. During recent votes on stopgap spending measures, many Republicans have pushed for greater spending cuts or added restrictions on how funding could be used for government programs. Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp is again pushing to add language to the bill that would prevent federal agencies from using any of their money to implement the new health care law.\n\nThe new spending bill also extends the pay freeze in effect for federal employees, as well as Members of Congress. The Obama administration has urged that federal workers receive a small salary increase. The House is expected to begin debate on the spending bill on Wednesday and vote on it on Thursday.",
    " Title: \"The Debate Over Taxing the Rich: A Closer Look at the 'Tax the Rich' Movement and Its Claims\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, the 'Tax the Rich' movement has gained traction, with the slogan being a rallying cry for many who believe that the wealthy should contribute more to the nation's tax revenue. This movement was recently highlighted at the \"Tax the Rich!\" conference, organized by the group Patriotic Millionaires.\n\nThe movement's mission statement suggests that the solution to many of America's problems lies in taxing the rich more, implying that the current tax system is not sufficient. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a different story.\n\nIt is true that the rich do pay a significant portion of federal taxes. In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that 44 percent of Americans will not pay any federal income taxes for 2018. This doesn't mean they don't pay any taxes, of course. Payroll taxes eat up a big chunk of many Americans' paychecks. But the income tax is remarkably progressive, with Americans in the top 20 percent paying an estimated 87 percent of income taxes for 2018, up from 84 percent in 2017.\n\nThe 'Tax the Rich' movement, when it moves beyond sloganeering, often advocates for the rich to \"pay their fair share.\" However, the concept of fairness is subjective, and it's not preposterous to argue that the rich should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. But it's also not preposterous to say that when 1 percent of the people provide more than a third of income-tax revenue, they're already paying their fair share.\n\nAnother common argument for hiking income taxes for the wealthy or taxing wealth itself is that the rich don't deserve their money, or that the super-rich don't deserve their wealth. This argument, however, is based on subjective moral judgments and ignores the economic realities of wealth creation.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Tax the Rich' movement's claims should be viewed with a critical eye. While it's important to address income inequality, it's equally important to base policy decisions on facts and not on emotional appeals or subjective moral judgments. A balanced approach that considers the economic realities of wealth creation and taxation is necessary for a fair and sustainable tax system.",
    " Title: The Rise of the Imperial Presidency: A Conservative Perspective on the Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn November 2010, the election of a Republican majority in the House of Representatives marked a clear repudiation of President Obama's policies and agenda. Instead of seizing this opportunity to adjust course and rebuild trust with the American electorate, President Obama chose a different path: the path of an imperial presidency.\n\nAs a conservative freshman in Congress, one expects policy disagreements with a liberal president. However, what transpired was not a productive, albeit sometimes heated, exchange of ideas between the legislative and executive branches. Rather, it was an all-out executive power play, a rejection of substantive, democratic dialogue with his colleagues in the other side of the aisle in a co-equal branch of government.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this executive power play was President Obama's decision to cease enforcing important policies against illegal immigration. Arizona's immigration law, S.B. 1070, aimed to compensate for the Obama administration's long-standing failure to comply with pre-existing federal immigration law. The president sued Arizona to stop the state from enforcing federal immigration policy, lost an important part of that suit by a unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court, and then, on the day of the ruling, announced that the federal government would cease to cooperate in the 287(g) Task Force, a pragmatic state-federal partnership designed to assist local law enforcement in dealing with apprehended illegal immigrants.\n\nAn earlier sign of President Obama's arrogance came in February 2011, when he announced that the Department of Justice would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court, even though it's a federal law passed with bipartisan support and signed by President Clinton. Once again, it was Mr. Obama's willingness to flout established laws for political gain and convenience.\n\nPresident Obama's imperial nature has also been on display overseas, in his role as commander in chief. Last year, after weeks of dithering, he decided to engage in what his advisers creatively termed \"kinetic military action\" in Libya. American engagement in Libya was a difficult decision that divided the American people and Congress alike, but Mr. Obama didn't seem to care. Members of both parties were appalled when he authorized military action without congressional approval. In the current context of international upheaval and armed conflict in Syria, the potential implications of Mr. Obama's actions were quite serious.\n\nWhether he is commanding the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions or implementing net neutrality via the Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Obama continues to circumvent Congress and treat the Constitution's balance of powers with wanton disregard. He also has demonstrated an astounding contempt for the constitutionally mandated process of Senate review of presidential appointees.\n\nIn an effort to sneak through an unpopular, partisan \"czar\" for his newly created regulatory behemoth, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mr. Obama made a recess appointment, or so he claimed. Unfortunately, his claim was blatantly false, as the Senate was in the midst of a pro forma session. As a senator, Mr. Obama habitually decried recess appointments. Yet as president, with his eyes fixed on the expansion and politically expedient exercise of his own power, he has not only hypocritically embraced recess appointments but unconstitutionally redefined the term.\n\nMr. Obama's imperial temperament was revealed again during his shameless exchange with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Thinking they were off-microphone at a photo opportunity, he plaintively asked Mr. Medvedev to give him \"space\" regarding missile defense until after the November election. In that moment, Mr. Obama undermined before Russia and the entire world the unity of the American people and their government. Considering the strategic significance of missile defense, this was one of the worst displays of presidential duplicity in history, once again revealing Mr. Obama's proclivity for placing himself and his political objectives ahead of the people, their Constitution, and their security. It ought to give every American pause about exactly what this president might attempt to do were he given a second term.\n\nIn the meantime, voters are still waiting for our intrepid press corps to demand of the president exactly what he intends to give the Russians on missile defense that must be concealed from the American people until after he has been re-elected. It's time we put partisan differences aside and unite in defense of limited government and executive restraint. We must put an end to the era of the imperial presidency. In order to save America, we must save the nation from President Obama.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Mueller Investigates 2016 Meeting Between Michael Flynn and Dana Rohrabacher\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing story, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is questioning witnesses about a September 2016 meeting between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the meeting took place on Sept. 20, 2016, in Washington, D.C., with several associates from Flynn's private security firm, the Flynn Intel Group, also in attendance. Rohrabacher, a long-standing Republican congressman known for advocating for friendlier ties with Russia, is under scrutiny, as is the special counsel's review of emails exchanged between Flynn's associates and Rohrabacher's staff.\n\nThe purpose behind Mueller's interest in the meeting remains unclear, but Rohrabacher has ties to the Kremlin and WikiLeaks, which U.S. defense officials have described as a hostile intelligence agency. He has also had contact with Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russia-aligned lobbyist present at Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with Russian political operatives at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Rohrabacher attempted to broker a deal between Julian Assange and the Department of Justice, under which Assange would surrender data exonerating Russia of involvement in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee. Rohrabacher met with Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in August. While the Justice Department has not indicted Assange for any crimes, they have long sought to bring a case against him for his role in facilitating the release of hundreds of thousands of sensitive intelligence documents via Chelsea Manning.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California joked last year that Rohrabacher's frequent apologies for Russian President Vladimir Putin created the impression that the congressman is on Putin's payroll. \"There's two people I think Putin pays \u2014 Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God,\" he said.\n\nFlynn served as President Donald Trump's national security advisor for less than one month before resigning in disgrace for lying to administration officials about his communications with the Russian government during the transition. His extensive and undisclosed ties to the Erdogan government in Turkey are expected to prompt an indictment in the coming weeks.\n\nThe congressman's office did not return a request for comment by press time.",
    " Title: The Future of Grocery Shopping: A Shift Towards Online and Local Shopping Amidst the Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has led to a significant change in consumer habits, particularly in the realm of grocery shopping. With dining out restricted due to lockdowns, people still need to eat, and online grocery shopping, both delivery and pickup, is emerging as a more attractive option.\n\nWhile the majority of food shopping is still expected to take place in physical stores, online grocery shopping is predicted to rise significantly due to the pandemic. According to Bryan Leach, CEO of the digital-shopping-promotions company Ibotta, online grocery shopping could increase from its current 3% to double-digit figures.\n\nThis shift towards online shopping could bring about a new era in grocery shopping, with a potential focus on smaller, local supermarkets. The convenience, cost-effectiveness, and reduced risk of infection associated with online grocery shopping could encourage companies to better remunerate grocery workers and inspire Americans to support local businesses.\n\nThe rise of online grocery shopping could also lead to a redefinition of the role of grocery workers. They might be seen less as mere laborers and more as dedicated professionals with specialized knowledge and experience, similar to the small shopkeepers of the turn of the century or community-supported agriculture services.\n\nThis shift towards smaller-scale, more attentive grocery service is already underway. As superstores have grown larger and consolidated, they have made room for shops catering to more specific markets. This includes stores like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, before Amazon's acquisition, and small butcher shops, which have been enjoying a resurgence.\n\nThe pandemic seems to be accelerating these trends, with increased urban densification and the rising popularity of buying non-perishable goods online contributing to this shift. If online grocery can supply the basics, this could be a boon for Main Street-style local shopping.\n\nHowever, this future also presents potential challenges. The difficulty of returns, the need to schedule online shopping at a time when you can be home to put perishables away, and the potential premium cost of pickup or delivery are concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the pandemic could lead to a seismic shift in grocery shopping habits, with a potential increase in online grocery shopping and a focus on smaller, local supermarkets. This change could bring about a more attentive, specialized approach to food shopping, but it also presents challenges that need to be addressed.",
    " Title: Former Governor Mark Sanford Wins House Seat in Political Comeback\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, disgraced former Governor Mark Sanford has made a political comeback, winning the House seat in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. His opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a political newcomer, showed signs of inexperience during the campaign.\n\nSanford, who was once embroiled in a well-publicized extra-marital affair and ethics violations, finished his second term in office three years ago. However, he managed to secure a victory over Colbert Busch in the special election for the vacant House seat, a position he previously held.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor was open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad. Voters granted him political redemption, as Sanford himself acknowledged at his victory celebration, stating, \"I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace.\"\n\nElizabeth Colbert Busch's campaign, along with two national Democratic groups, highlighted the affair and criticized Sanford's use of tax dollars during his secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. Despite the political baggage, Sanford's campaign strategy seemed to resonate with voters, particularly in the district's conservative counties.\n\nSanford's campaign strategy appeared to be grassroots-focused, with the candidate appearing at nearly 25 events in the campaign's closing days. The high turnout for a special election, with roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voting, may have contributed to Sanford's victory.\n\nThe 1st Congressional District is traditionally Republican, with Mitt Romney carrying the district by 18 percentage points in the 2012 presidential election. Sanford won all five counties in the district, taking around 60% of the vote in the conservative counties of Berkeley and Dorchester. He also carried the district's second most populous county, Beaufort, by 6 percentage points.\n\nIn the microcosm of the election, Sanford narrowly carried his home base of Charleston County, where the most voters were at stake. This was also Colbert Busch's best hope. Colbert Busch's campaign outspent Sanford's operation in the closing weeks, but the DCCC and House Majority PAC combined spent around $900,000 to try to defeat Sanford, who received far less support from outside groups.\n\nIn the end, Sanford's political experience, grassroots campaigning, and ability to overcome his past scandals proved to be the deciding factors in his victory.",
    " Title: White House Faces Internal Debate Over Timing of Immigration Announcement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is currently grappling with a contentious internal debate over the timing of President Barack Obama's anticipated announcement on immigration policy, as pressure mounts from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nChris Newman, the legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, has urged President Obama to act swiftly, expressing hope that the president's conscience will guide his decision. Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, a Democrat from Illinois, has also weighed in, expressing concern that any delay could result in further family separations and children being placed in foster care. Guti\u00e9rrez, who has at times been critical of the administration's approach, remains optimistic that the president will prioritize families and security over short-term political maneuvers.\n\nWithin the White House, the timing of the announcement has become a hotly debated topic, even as immigration lawyers at the Department of Homeland Security work to develop legally defensible policy options for the president. Some advisers to the president are advocating for a delay, apprehensive of the potential political backlash from a broad action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and to provide many of them with official work papers. Such a move, they fear, could ignite a heated battle with Republicans and potentially jeopardize the hopes of Democratic Senate candidates in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, and potentially Iowa.\n\nControl of the Senate hangs in the balance of the half-dozen close races in states where President Obama's popularity is low, particularly in Southern states where opposition to immigration overhaul is high. Strategists worry that an immigration announcement could harm Democratic candidates.\n\nDemocratic senators have reached out to top White House officials, including Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, to argue that the recent crisis with unaccompanied minors crossing the border into the United States justifies a delay. Several Democratic officials on Capitol Hill claim that the angry reaction to that border crisis has eroded public support for changing immigration policy, and in some cases, turned the issue into a liability for them.\n\nHowever, others within the White House are advocating for the president to adhere to his promised schedule, regardless of the immediate political consequences. They argue that Republicans will criticize the president and attack Democratic candidates even if President Obama delays parts of his announcement until after the election.",
    " Title: Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson Faces Civil Rights Investigation and Potential Civil Suit Despite Grand Jury Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nFerguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson, whose shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked months of protests, will not be free from legal troubles despite the grand jury's decision not to indict him. The Department of Justice is conducting a civil rights investigation into the incident, and Brown's family could file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson.\n\nThe grand jury, which convened on August 20, did not weigh whether Wilson had a justifiable reason to shoot Brown. The FBI defines \"justifiable homicide\" by law enforcement as \"killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty.\" In 2011, police killed 404 people in the line of duty, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report said. In 2012, officers killed 410, and in 2013, the number grew to 461\u2014the most in two decades.\n\nWilson, who has been on paid leave since the incident, could face civil rights charges brought by the Justice Department or a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by Brown's parents. In a civil trial, Brown's family could seek monetary damages, as the victim's family did in the case of football player O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted in a criminal trial of his wife's murder but ordered by a court in a civil trial to pay millions to her family.\n\nThe federal government's probe could have wide-ranging consequences not only for Wilson but also for the entire Police Department. \"Their claims would not just be excessive force, which would be directly associated with the police officer, but failure to adequately train the police officer,\" said James Cohen, a professor at Fordham University Law School. \"Then, you sort of implicate the whole department and its structure.\"\n\nBrown's family could sue Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department for excessive force and wrongful death. The federal government's investigation could lead to changes in the Police Department's training and policies.\n\nMore unlikely, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney could take a crack at Wilson. The grand jury's decision would not preclude a prosecutor from bringing new evidence to another grand jury or bypassing the grand jury entirely by filing a criminal complaint.\n\nThe court's treatment of Wilson's case may affect how prosecutors handle future cases, including whether evidence that does not support an indictment may be presented. \"I think we will see a call for a real wholesale review of how the criminal justice system functions,\" said Susan McGraugh, a criminal defense lawyer and a professor at the St. Louis University School of Law. \"People want to be heard in terms of a lot of the systemic injustices in the criminal justice system.\"",
    " Title: Post-Supreme Court Ruling: The Road Ahead for the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has marked a significant victory for President Obama and his supporters, but the political scientist Eric Patashnik's book \"Reforms at Risk\" warns that the law's survival is not guaranteed. The key to the ACA's success lies in its ability to endure over time and build strong political support to withstand future attacks.\n\nCongressional Republicans, led by House Speaker John Boehner and presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have vowed to push for the ACA's repeal and will likely continue to attack its funding. The Supreme Court's decision on Medicaid has raised questions about the commitment of red state governors to expand the program.\n\nImplementing and enforcing the law also pose challenges. Issues such as enforcing penalties on those who refuse to buy insurance, the effectiveness of cost controls, and the quality of state-run health care exchanges are all areas of concern. Some state officials are refusing to implement the law until after the November elections, potentially leaving the federal government to step in and set up these states' health care exchanges.\n\nHistorically, sturdy federal programs did not always start out strong. Social Security, for example, faced significant challenges during World War II, but Congress made adjustments to expand coverage and revise the tax system, ultimately leading to the program's success. Similarly, the Supreme Court's 1936 decision to strike down an agricultural-processing tax led to congressional revisions that resolved constitutional problems and protected farmers.\n\nThe ACA's future will depend on Congress's ability to refine and improve the law to ensure its effectiveness. The 2012 election will be a critical moment for health care, as the outcome could determine whether the law is strengthened or repealed. If the ACA is not implemented successfully, a future Congress may use its power to repeal the legislation and complete the job the Supreme Court did not finish.",
    " Title: A Comparison Between Nixon's 'Enemies List' and Woodward's Alleged Threat: A Look at History and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, conservative media figure Matt Drudge has drawn comparisons between the firestorm over an alleged email threat to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward by a White House aide and the Nixon White House's infamous 'Enemies List.' However, this comparison has been met with skepticism due to its historical inaccuracies.\n\nRight-wing media often equate President Obama's administration with Nixon's, highlighting instances where they believe Obama White House activities mirror the Nixon White House's 'Enemies List.' Yet, many conservatives have distanced themselves from Woodward's questionable intimidation claim.\n\nOn February 28, The Drudge Report published an article that drew parallels between the two, but this claim overlooks the true nature of Nixon's 'Enemies List.' The list, a 1971 memorandum from White House Counsel John Dean to White House Chief of Staff John Haldeman's assistant, was titled \"Dealing with our political enemies.\" The memo outlined a plan to use the federal government's power to financially damage political opponents, including journalists. The Nixon White House went beyond sending harsh emails to reporters; its aides even plotted to assassinate a critical columnist.\n\nThe Watergate hearings revealed the memo, which detailed a scheme where a \"good project coordinator\" would gather requests from high-ranking presidential aides about targets, determine how to use the federal government's power to damage them, and receive \"the full support of the top officials\" in federal agencies to implement the plan.\n\nFurthermore, the actions of Nixon administration and campaign official G. Gordon Liddy, as documented by various sources, are a stark contrast to the alleged email threat faced by Woodward. Liddy served four and a half years in prison for his role in the Watergate break-in and the break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg, the military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers. Liddy has acknowledged planning to kill someone during the Ellsberg break-in, plotting to murder journalist Jack Anderson, plotting with a \"gangland figure\" to murder Howard Hunt to stop him from cooperating with investigators, plotting to firebomb the Brookings Institution, and plotting to kidnap \"leftist guerillas\" at the 1972 Republican National Convention\u2014plans that were never carried out, but the break-ins were.\n\nIn contrast, Woodward received an email from White House economic adviser Gene Sperling in which the aide stated, \"I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that [President Obama] asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.\" Woodward replied, \"I also welcome your personal advice. I am listening.\"\n\nThis comparison between the Nixon 'Enemies List' and the alleged email threat to Woodward highlights the need for historical accuracy in political discourse. The actions of the Nixon administration and its officials, as demonstrated by the Watergate scandal and the actions of figures like G. Gordon Liddy, serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of politically motivated intimidation and abuse of power.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce STEM Jobs Act, Focusing on Family Reunification and Visas for Foreign Students in STEM Fields\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the nation's immigration system and respond to the Hispanic community's top priority, House Republicans are set to vote on immigration legislation next week. The bill, known as the STEM Jobs Act, aims to expand visas for foreign students specializing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, as well as make it easier for those with green cards to bring their immediate families to the U.S.\n\nThe House previously voted on a similar bill in September, but it was defeated due to a two-thirds majority requirement and opposition from more than 80 percent of Democrats. The new bill, to be considered under normal procedures, will not require a supermajority and is expected to pass the Republican-led House.\n\nThe proposed legislation seeks to alleviate the long wait times for family reunification by allowing family members to come to the U.S. one year after they apply for their green cards, although they would not be able to work until they actually receive the card. The bill applies to the families of green card holders who marry after obtaining their residency permits.\n\nBruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman and author of the 1990 immigration law, noted that the bill does not increase the number of green cards or expedite the process, but it does allow family members to live legally in the United States with their spouses. Morrison, an immigration policy lobbyist, views the bill as a stepping-stone towards more comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nThe bill would grant 55,000 green cards annually to doctoral and master's graduates in the STEM fields, aiming to keep skilled workers in the U.S. and benefit American companies. However, the legislation would eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which currently distributes 55,000 green cards annually to individuals from countries with traditionally low rates of immigration to the U.S., primarily in Africa.\n\nThe House's Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus all opposed the bill in September, arguing that it attempts to increase legal immigration for some while ending it for others. Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, views the bill as a positive step towards immigration reform discussions but doubts it will make significant progress during the short lame-duck session.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Suspends 2020 Presidential Campaign, Clearing Path for Biden-Trump Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a livestreamed speech from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party's progressive wing, announced the suspension of his 2020 presidential campaign. This development marks the end of a long and contentious primary race and sets the stage for a November 3 election battle between former Vice President Joe Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump.\n\nSanders, who had been a frontrunner in the Democratic race, acknowledged that he no longer had a viable path to victory after a series of decisive losses to Biden. The independent senator from Vermont emphasized the urgent need for a broad response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has disrupted his campaign and limited his ability to communicate his message.\n\n\"I can not in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win, and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders, who is 78 years old, expressed that his decision was a difficult and painful one but vowed to stay on the ballot in future primaries and continue to gather delegates to influence the Democratic platform towards his populist, anti-corporate agenda. This includes a government-run healthcare system, higher taxes for the wealthy, and a $15 minimum wage, among other policy proposals.\n\nThe departure of Sanders leaves Biden as the last remaining candidate in the Democratic field, which once boasted more than two dozen contenders. The upcoming White House race will now pit Biden, who is 77 years old, against Trump, who is 73 and seeking a second term in office. The election will likely revolve around Trump's handling of the public health crisis and the resulting economic disruption.\n\nBiden, who has signaled his readiness for a challenging general election fight, praised Sanders and expressed his intention to incorporate Sanders' ideas into his White House run. In a statement, Biden said, \"I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You're needed.\"\n\nWinning over Sanders' most ardent supporters will not be an easy task. Sanders' speechwriter, David Sirota, suggested that Biden should reconsider his opposition to certain aspects of Sanders' agenda that polls show are popular among Democratic voters.\n\n\"Biden's campaign has to do its part to bring those voters into the fold and energize them in a real way, and they're going to have to do more than just saying Donald Trump is bad. So far, Biden has not done that,\" Sirota said.\n\nSanders' policy positions, such as Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage, have become mainstream within the Democratic Party. Sanders noted that these ideas, once considered radical, are now widely accepted and are being implemented in cities and states across the country.\n\nTrump, who has courted Sanders' supporters and criticized the Democratic Party establishment, reacted quickly on Twitter, writing, \"This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!\"\n\nDemocrats said Sanders' decision to withdraw from the 2020 race now would provide the party with more time to unite before the August nominating convention. Some Democrats blame Sanders for staying in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton too long, which they argue hurt her general election bid against Trump.\n\n\"I think that allows more time for healing,\" said Democratic operative Joel Payne, who worked for Clinton's campaign in 2016.",
    " Title: Romney Advocates Tying Foreign Aid to Market Liberalization, Obama Emphasizes Free Speech at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney called for a reevaluation of the disbursement of American foreign aid, suggesting that it could be linked to the opening of markets and promotion of employment. Romney's proposal is likely to spark debate, as many labor rights organizations argue that free trade agreements, similar to those advocated by Romney, may lead to job losses overseas.\n\nDuring his speech, Romney shared a light-hearted moment with former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Barack Obama in swing states. Romney joked about the assistance Clinton has provided his rival on the campaign trail, stating, \"If there's one thing we've learned this election season, it's that a few words from Bill Clinton can do a man a lot of good.\"\n\nPresident Obama, in a separate address, focused on the importance of freedom of speech in the United States, citing the right to express even \"crude and disgusting\" content. Obama received applause in the vast hall as he emphasized the United States' commitment to protecting free speech, despite potential backlash.\n\nObama explained the value of the First Amendment in a diverse society, stating that efforts to restrict speech can be used to silence critics or oppress minorities. He also highlighted the role of free speech in countering hateful speech, emphasizing the power of tolerance and mutual respect in promoting understanding.\n\nIn the aftermath of the violent anti-American protests that led to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, in Benghazi, Libya, two weeks ago, Obama reaffirmed the United States' commitment to democratic freedoms in the Muslim world. He called for the marginalization of those who use hatred of America, the West, or Israel as a central political principle, arguing that such a stance only provides cover for those resorting to violence.\n\nObama also addressed the Iranian nuclear issue, stating that time to diplomatically resolve the issue is not unlimited but that the United States remains committed to resolving it peacefully. He refused to establish a new \"red line\" for Iran, despite calls from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for such a measure.\n\nThroughout his speech, Obama emphasized the Arab democracy movement and its consequences. The speech was reportedly inspired by President Obama's own thoughts after learning of the attacks in Benghazi and his subsequent visit to the State Department to console grieving employees. Obama returned to the subject of the devotion of diplomats like Stevens and the American ideals they uphold at the United Nations on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Ted Cruz of Imitating His Border Wall Plan in Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview aired on Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized Texas Senator Ted Cruz for allegedly copying his call to build a wall on the Mexican border and positioning himself as a leader in the national immigration debate.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Trump stated, \"Ted Cruz is trying to step up his whole game on amnesty and on illegal immigration because it was actually quite weak.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Cruz's plan is more stringent on undocumented workers, Trump responded, \"Well, first of all, his plan just happened. In fact, I was watching the other day. And I was watching Ted talk. And he said, 'We will build a wall.' The first time I've ever heard him say it.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"My wife, who was sitting next to me, said, 'Oh, look. He's copying what you've been saying for a long period of time.'\"\n\nThe real estate mogul then discussed his stance on deportation, emphasizing the need for a strong border and the possibility of legal re-entry.\n\n\"And I'm the one that came up with it. Look. When I announced that I was running, I brought up illegal immigration. It was not even a subject that would have been discussed in this debate. And now it's one of the very big subjects,\" he said.\n\nTrump also compared Cruz's and Florida Senator Marco Rubio's immigration stances, stating that both are attempting to strengthen their positions due to past weaknesses.\n\n\"So they're trying to get stronger. But, look, nobody has that position like I have that position. I want the wall. I want strong borders. I want everybody out. Now, people are coming to me. But nobody has that issue like me,\" he said.\n\n\"And nobody's going to be able to do it like me. Nobody. As an example, on the wall. Nobody is getting Mexico to pay for the wall, the cost of the wall, but me. They do not even know about that. That's not even in their vocabulary,\" Trump concluded.",
    " Title: A Historical Examination of the Balance Between Freedom of Speech and National Security in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, a nation built on the principles of freedom and democracy, has a long and complex history of navigating the delicate balance between individual rights and national security. The First Amendment, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, guarantees the freedoms of speech, the press, and the right to assemble. However, attempts to suppress these liberties have been a persistent theme throughout American history, particularly during times of war or perceived national security threats.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of such suppression can be traced back to the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Authored by Federalists such as John Adams, these acts prohibited the publication of \"false, scandalous, and malicious\" writings against the government. The acts led to the imprisonment of newspaper editors, the denial of entry to the U.S. for immigrants, and the deportation of foreigners.\n\nFast forward to the Civil War era, and President Abraham Lincoln, often revered as a symbol of freedom, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, allowing individuals to be arrested and held without formal charges. Suspected political prisoners were tried before military tribunals, a practice that may seem unfathomable today.\n\nDuring World War I, the Sedition and Espionage Acts were enacted, extending restrictions to a broad range of activities, notably speech. The Sedition Act of 1918 forbade the use of \"disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language\" about the government, the flag, or the military. The early 1900s saw the formation of the Bureau of Investigation (the BOI), later known as the FBI, to fight corruption in government and law enforcement. President Woodrow Wilson used the BOI to clamp down on civil liberties in a manner unprecedented in American history, setting the stage for monitoring activities still practiced today.\n\nHistorian Jennifer Weber notes that Wilson's administration systematically pursued leftists, immigrants, and political dissidents not because of their actions but because of their political beliefs. Violators faced substantial fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years, their crime being free speech.\n\nEfforts to suppress free speech were not limited to just anti-war related dissent. The flu pandemic of 1918, which resulted in 50-100 million deaths around the world, was exacerbated by censorship, which minimized early reports of its spread in an attempt to keep wartime morale at high levels.\n\nIn the decades that followed the First World War, the nation saw increased suppression of civil rights on a variety of fronts. Labor unions, feminists, and communists were among the groups targeted by newly-formed investigative groups, supported by laws at both federal and local levels.\n\nWorld War II brought us the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and McCarthyism. The Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 60s was characterized by government suppression of individual rights. The Vietnam War Era was ripe with anti-war protests and corresponding efforts by the government to control dissent.\n\nWere these efforts always within the law and consistent with principles of free speech? Today, we are subject to NSA spying on American citizens and the Patriot Act, which \"arms law enforcement with new tools to detect and prevent terrorism.\" One hundred years ago, a journalist writing on this topic could face imprisonment. Today, perhaps the only consequence is some attention from the NSA. Past precedents could change this yet again in the future.\n\nSo, the next time you hear the phrase \"America: The Land of the Free,\" ask yourself: Are we truly as free as we think?",
    " Title: Illinois Teen's Vaping-Induced Illness Highlights Concerns Over E-Cigarette Use Among Youth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning to youngsters, an 18-year-old Illinois resident, Adam Hergenreder, currently hospitalized in Libertyville due to a \"vaping-induced acute lung injury,\" has urged his peers to stop vaping. The Chicago Tribune reported that Hergenreder, a resident of Gurnee, is currently hooked to oxygen tubes and is facing months of recovery, with the possibility of permanent lung damage due to scarring from inflammation.\n\nHergenreder, who started vaping at 16, preferred mint and mango flavors. He admitted to ignoring warnings from teachers, parents, and health officials until it was nearly too late. He was admitted to the hospital after several days of uncontrolled vomiting.\n\n\"People just see that little pod and think, how could that do anything to my body?\" Hergenreder said Tuesday from Advocate Condell Medical Center. \"I'm glad I could be an example and show people that [vaping products] aren't good at all. They will mess up your lungs.\"\n\nAccording to the Tribune, Hergenreder used about one and a half Juul pods daily. He initially thought the substance was just vape juice, unaware of nicotine. He then moved on to vaping marijuana, purchasing devices from street dealers that could be altered or contaminated with unknown substances. This daily regimen led him to an emergency room, where a doctor ordered a scan of his stomach and discovered something amiss.\n\nHergenreder's condition has since improved due to oxygen tubes, steroids, and antibiotics. However, he is one of at least 27 patients in Illinois who have been hospitalized in recent weeks with severe respiratory illnesses, including one fatality.\n\nHealth officials in Oregon also announced the death of a second person due to a severe lung illness linked to vaping, the first such death connected to a vaping product purchased at a marijuana dispensary. As of late last week, a total of 215 possible cases of severe lung disease associated with e-cigarettes have been reported by 25 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn a statement to The Post, a Juul spokesman said the company takes the health of its users seriously, labeling its products with \"ingredient disclosures\" and health warnings. The company also stated that its devices and manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous quality and certification standards, and it conducts extensive preclinical and toxicological testing of the ingredients and analytes in Juul e-liquids and aerosols.\n\nJuul is also working to stop counterfeit products compatible with its devices, which are often marketed in violation of Food and Drug Administration laws. The company stated that it does not have details about the specific event involving Hergenreder, as it does not know what or whose products were consumed.\n\nHergenreder hopes to leave the hospital in days if his condition continues to improve. However, only \"time and further pulmonary testing\" will tell if his breathing will ever return to normal in the weeks and months ahead, his doctor told the Tribune.\n\n\"I feel stupid,\" Hergenreder told the newspaper. \"I want other people to stop. It's going to attack your lungs.\"",
    " Title: California Eliminates Retroactive Tax Deduction for Qualified Small Businesses, Sparking Concerns Among Entrepreneurs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has left many entrepreneurs and investors in California in a state of uncertainty, the state has decided to eliminate a tax deduction that has long encouraged the establishment and growth of businesses within the state. The deduction, which allowed entrepreneurs to exclude 50% of any gain on the sale of Qualified Small Business (QSB) stock, has been a significant factor in keeping businesses within California, as the state's capital gains taxes are high at 9%.\n\nThe elimination of the deduction, effective retroactively from 2008, means that anyone who sold their California company in the past five years and took advantage of the tax deduction will now have to pay the tax. This decision has been met with criticism, particularly from the startup community, who argue that it is unfair and could potentially drive young, growing businesses to more favorable environments.\n\nBrian Overstreet, a California entrepreneur who sold his company last year, wrote about this tax decision on Xconomy. As a recipient of the tax deduction, Overstreet will now have to pay the tax. In his article, he expressed his concerns about the impact of this decision, stating that it will have far-reaching implications and could potentially discourage companies from locating in California.\n\nOverstreet argued that the California Franchise Tax Board's (FTB) retroactive decision is not only unfair but could also send a chilling message that could drive young, growing businesses to friendlier environments. He emphasized that this is not just about him, but about everyone in the startup community and the potentially debilitating tax bills that are set to arrive in mailboxes across the state in the coming months.\n\nOverstreet's company was not a large, faceless corporation. It was a small, vibrant business with a local workforce, embodying the essence of a Qualified Small Business. The FTB's retroactive decision could have significant consequences for entrepreneurs and investors in California in the coming months.",
    " Title: SolarCity Corp. Under Investigation for Potential Misuse of Federal Tax Credits\n\nArticle:\n\nA California-based solar energy company, SolarCity Corp., which has received millions in federal tax credits since 2008, is under investigation for potential misuse of these credits, raising concerns about the company's financial stability and its similarities to the failed solar panel manufacturer Solyndra.\n\nThe company, which counts Elon Musk, a high-profile donor and fundraiser for President Obama, among its biggest investors, has reported losses of $322 million since 2008. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has expressed concerns about SolarCity's financial standing, likening it to Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees before going bankrupt in 2011.\n\nIn a letter to the Treasury Department on Monday, Sessions wrote, \"There is concern that SolarCity might become the next Solyndra\u2014a company propped on the back of the taxpayers.\"\n\nSolarCity responded Tuesday, denying the Solyndra comparison and stating that the company will soon address the allegations made by Sessions, now that the Securities and Exchange Commission's \"quiet period\" has ended. The company's spokesman, Will Craven, told FoxNews.com, \"The forces which drove Solyndra into bankruptcy\u2014steeply declining solar panel prices\u2014are precisely what has driven the success of our business, as those declining prices allow more Americans to go solar.\"\n\nBeyond SolarCity, Sessions alleges that the company may have overestimated the \"fair market value\" of its products to secure higher tax credits, potentially reaping financial benefits at the expense of American taxpayers. The Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General confirmed Tuesday an investigation into the matter, roughly 14 months after SolarCity acknowledged in its initial public offering that the inspector general's office had issued subpoenas to several participants in the rooftop solar energy installation industry, including SolarCity.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing investigation, SolarCity subsidiaries Sequoia Pacific Solar and Eiger Lease Co are challenging the federal government in court for imposing tougher guidelines in calculating the market value of solar-energy systems. SolarCity officials, including fellow Obama donor and Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, acknowledged in the IPO document the continuing need for government support, as alternative-energy companies strive to become competitive with conventional energy sources.\n\nSolyndra, a solar-panel maker touted by Obama, received an estimated $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees before going bankrupt in 2011, repaying only a projected $143 million of the money. Though the cash-grant program for SolarCity and others has concluded, the tax-credit program, which could continue through 2016, remains a point of contention.\n\nSessions wrote in his letter to Treasury Secretary Lew, \"The financial pressures related to a private company's survival should not cause the federal government to modify its policies or place additional taxpayer money at risk.\" He also asked when the tax-credit program would end and exactly how much SolarCity has received.\n\nSolarCity reported a third-quarter profit last month after years of losses, including $91.6 million in 2019. Musk, the company's chairman, has benefited significantly from government credits and funding through his various ventures. In addition to the $465 million loan Tesla received in 2010 from the Obama administration, which was recently paid off, the company has also received thousands in federal tax credits. Tesla has struggled with profitability and is now under investigation related to vehicle fires.\n\nSpaceX, another of Musk's ventures, received $381 million from NASA last year to compete in the race to replace government space missions with commercial flights. The company also has the opportunity to take part in billions of dollars worth of NASA contracts. Musk and SolarCity's other investors who have given to Obama campaigns include Nancy Pfund and Bennet Van De Bunt, who each gave $2,300 toward Obama's 2008 election, according to the Federal Election Commission.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Aide Richard Gates Pleads Guilty, Agrees to Cooperate with Mueller's Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, former Trump campaign adviser Richard Gates pleaded guilty to two charges on Friday afternoon. The plea came as part of a deal with Mueller's team in a federal court in Washington, D.C.\n\nGates admitted to one count of conspiracy against the United States and one count of making a false statement to the FBI agents investigating Russian interference. According to court documents, as part of the plea deal, Gates has agreed to cooperate \"fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly\" with Mueller's office, as well as other law enforcement officials. This cooperation includes the provision of relevant documents, attendance at requested meetings, and testimony, both before and after sentencing.\n\nThe plea deal stipulates that no additional criminal charges will be brought against Gates in exchange for his full cooperation. The criminal information filed by Mueller on Friday, prior to Gates' guilty plea, alleges that Gates lied to federal investigators about a March 2013 meeting during which former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, an unnamed member of Congress, reportedly Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), and an unnamed lobbyist discussed Ukraine-related matters.\n\nMueller filed the criminal information a day after he unveiled a new superseding indictment charging Gates and Manafort with financial-related crimes stemming from their work for pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine over the past decade. The alleged crimes are unrelated to the work Manafort and Gates did for the Trump campaign.\n\nMueller accused the two longtime business associates of laundering more than $30 million in income that they hid from the U.S. government.\n\nSpeculation has mounted over the past week that Gates would plead guilty and cooperate in Mueller's probe, making him a key witness who could testify in the criminal case against Manafort. The development is expected to ratchet up pressure on Manafort to cooperate in Mueller's investigation.\n\nManafort, who resigned as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after reports surfaced about his work for Russian-backed Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Yanukovych, could offer key details about the campaign relevant to Mueller's broader inquiry into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Moscow.\n\nIn response to Gates' guilty plea, Manafort issued a statement maintaining his innocence. \"Notwithstanding that Rick Gates pled today, I continue to maintain my innocence,\" Manafort said. \"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"\n\nGates served as Manafort's deputy on the campaign and went on to work for Trump's transition team. In a letter obtained by ABC News earlier Friday, Gates told friends and family that he had decided to plead guilty for the sake of his children. \"Despite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart,\" Gates wrote. \"The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much. I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Mixed Messages on Islamic State Strategy Spark Confusion Among Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivered seemingly conflicting messages on Wednesday regarding the United States' ultimate goal in the fight against the Islamic State (IS), stating that the objective is to \"degrade and destroy\" the terror group, but later claiming he wants to make it a \"manageable problem.\"\n\nDuring a press conference in Estonia, Obama initially took a hard line against the Islamic State, condemning the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff as \"horrific\" and \"barbaric,\" and vowing \"justice will be served.\" He reiterated that the U.S. objective is to \"degrade and destroy ISIL so it is no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States.\"\n\nHowever, later in the press conference, Obama softened his tone, stating that if the U.S. is joined by an international coalition, they can \"continue to shrink ISIL's sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.\"\n\nThe conflicting messages have sparked confusion on Capitol Hill and among allies. Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told Fox News that the president has not answered whether the U.S. aims to contain or crush ISIL. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia criticized the president's \"mixed messages\" on the Islamic State, while Senator John McCain of Arizona claimed the president does not yet have a strategy to implement the destruction of ISIL.\n\nThe president is in Europe this week for meetings with allies, where the Islamic State and the crisis in Ukraine will be on the table. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to the Middle East to build a stronger coalition to go after the Islamic State while boosting the Iraqi and Kurdish governments.\n\nThe Obama administration has stressed that the problems in Iraq must be addressed in large part by a new and inclusive government in Baghdad. However, the president continues to weigh whether to expand the current airstrike campaign in northern Iraq into Syria. On Wednesday, Obama did not give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to go after the extremist group's operations in Syria.\n\nThe execution of freelance reporter Steven Sotloff, who reportedly held dual American-Israeli citizenship, was the second such killing in two weeks, following the beheading of journalist James Foley. In the Sotloff video, a masked militant warns that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, \"our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.\"\n\nObama vowed that the U.S. would not forget the \"terrible crime against these two fine young men\" and that \"our reach is long and justice will be served.\" Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished a year ago in Syria and was not seen again until he appeared in the video that showed Foley's beheading. In the video distributed Tuesday and titled \"A Second Message to America,\" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State.",
    " Title: Democratic Establishment Faces Unease as Bernie Sanders Surges in Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political landscape that has seen the unexpected rise of outsider candidates, the Democratic party is now grappling with the challenge posed by Bernie Sanders. The once-assured front-runners, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, have been overshadowed by the Vermont senator's surging popularity in key primary states.\n\nThe political class was taken aback by the intensity of voter discontent, a sentiment that was similarly underestimated during the Republican primary race, where Donald Trump and Ted Cruz emerged as formidable contenders. The conventional wisdom at the start of 2015 predicted a strong showing for Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, but the former's failure to break into double digits and the latter's early-state strategy are now subjects of intense scrutiny.\n\nBoth Clinton and Bush share a common trait, hailing from political dynasties and relying on mega-donors to fund their campaigns. They are also figures of the 20th century, with Clinton standing by her husband during the 1992 campaign and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, while Bush ran for Florida governor in 1994 and has not held office since 2006. Both are perceived as steady, serious, and somewhat dull.\n\nThe arrival of Trump and Sanders, who were not initially favored by prognosticators, has seen them draw larger crowds and generate more enthusiasm than their rivals. Despite their ideological differences, both candidates are running against the establishment. Sanders, an independent throughout his career, has even criticized Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, organizations that are backing Clinton, as part of the establishment.\n\nTrump, who self-funds his campaign, has disrupted the traditional rules of engagement, forcing his rivals to take a more aggressive stance on issues such as illegal immigration. Sanders, who has raised significantly more funds than anticipated, has compelled Clinton to shift her positions on healthcare and taxes to the left.\n\nLiberal commentators have reveled in the spectacle of a Republican civil war, with some prominent voices on the right warning that the party could self-destruct by nominating Trump or Cruz, who has alienated the establishment as a freshman senator. However, it is now the Democratic elders who are expressing concern about the possibility of a self-proclaimed socialist leading their ticket and potentially jeopardizing down-ballot candidates.\n\n\"The Republicans won't touch him [in the primaries] because they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and sickle,\" Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Hillary supporter, told the New York Times.\n\nIn most campaigns, the insurgent candidate captures the media spotlight but ultimately fades: Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, Howard Dean, Bill Bradley, Pat Robertson, and Gary Hart. However, 2016 is not most campaign years. Trump, Cruz, and Sanders have exposed the vulnerabilities of the establishment in both parties, as well as the media's tendency to underestimate grassroots movements.",
    " Title: \" Republican Fiscal Orthodoxy Challenged as Bipartisan Budget Deal Sparks Concerns Over Ballooning Deficits and Market Volatility \"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant departure from traditional Republican fiscal policies, the recent bipartisan budget deal has raised concerns about trillion-dollar deficits and their potential long-term implications. Andy Roth, vice president of the conservative Club for Growth, expressed his apprehensions, stating, \"With this deal, we will experience trillion-dollar deficits permanently. That sort of behavior, the last time I checked, is not in the Republican platform.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department forecasts a borrowing requirement of $955 billion this fiscal year, with over $1 trillion expected in both 2019 and 2020. This substantial borrowing is expected to become increasingly costly as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and investors demand higher returns from a government burdened with growing debt.\n\nThe borrowing spree has contributed to recent volatility in financial markets, with investors worried that the additional fiscal stimulus, combined with a strengthening economy, could lead to inflation and faster-than-anticipated interest rate hikes. Major stock indexes plunged sharply on Thursday afternoon, entering a market correction, or a drop of more than 10% from their peak, primarily due to comments from the Bank of England suggesting it might raise interest rates sooner and to a higher degree as it seeks to combat potential inflation. As a result, investors flocked to bonds, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill to a four-year high of 2.88%.\n\nFor many Republicans, supporting the budget agreement represents a break from conservative fiscal orthodoxy that could pose risks in the upcoming midterm elections. The party's professed commitment to limited government and deficit reduction played a significant role in the Republicans regaining control of the House and Senate during the Obama administration and also aided President Trump's election, with the candidate promising to curb federal spending.\n\nLast May, the Trump administration released a budget projecting the United States would transition from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027. The budget called for deep cuts to domestic programs and a substantial increase in military spending. The current budget deal, however, appears to deviate from these projections, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of the U.S. fiscal policy.",
    " Title: Putin's Foreign Policy: A Reflection of Personal and Historical Experiences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview, Russian President Vladimir Putin has linked his intervention in Syria to his personal experiences, tracing the roots of his involvement back to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Putin, who was an officer of the KGB at the time, recounted his role in maintaining order during the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAccording to Putin, the events of 1989 profoundly shaped his character and policies. He witnessed the Berlin Wall's fall, the storming of the secret police compound in Dresden, and the subsequent chaos that ensued in the Soviet Union. Putin felt abandoned by Moscow during this time, and he believes that the state's authority is the ultimate bulwark against chaos.\n\nPutin's views on democracy are more nuanced. He has spoken out against it, likening it to mob rule, a perspective that has been a constant theme throughout his career. This perspective was further solidified by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004, which overturned the alleged victory of Putin's favored candidate, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nIn a speech on November 25, 2004, Putin stated, \"We should not use the method of using street disorder as a way of resolving such conflicts.\" This sentiment was echoed in 2011, when Putin, then serving as prime minister, expressed his disapproval of Western intervention in Libya, particularly the NATO-led operation.\n\nThe public breach between Putin and Medvedev, his protege, during this time contributed to Putin's decision to return to the presidency. In the years that followed, Putin's foreign policy became more hostile to the West, and he tightened laws at home to stifle any public protest.\n\nIn 2013, protests erupted in Ukraine over efforts to move the country closer to the European Union. Putin's response was firm, stating, \"Any citizen has a right to express their opinion about the decisions made, but this must be kept within the law.\" He also warned, \"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice but to force things in order. Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.\"\n\nPutin's belief in the state as a bulwark against chaos is evident in his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he views as the state of Syria. Putin's intervention in Syria is, in his words, a fight against the terrorists of the Islamic State.\n\nIn a speech at the United Nations on September 28, Putin cautioned, \"It seems, however, that far from learning from others' mistakes, everyone just keeps repeating them. And so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called 'democratic' ones, continues.\" Putin's foreign policy, rooted in his personal experiences and historical reflections, continues to shape Russia's role in global affairs.",

And for someone who says he wants to be president to say that, it shows he's just not presidential.\"\n\nDe Blasio also commented on Trump's perceived arrogance, saying, \"It's incredibly arrogant of him to suggest that his voters will be with him no matter what he does.\" He continued, \"You know, this is another indicator that Donald Trump is not ready for prime time.\"\n\nTrump has often boasted about his loyal supporters, and many of his supporters have been vocal about their devotion to the flamboyant billionaire real estate developer.\n\nIn addition to his criticism of Trump, Mr. de Blasio also addressed the issue of income inequality, a reaction to the possibility of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg entering the presidential race as an independent candidate.\n\n\"I respect my predecessor for sure,\" he said. \"But two things, I'd say. One, my candidate is Hillary Clinton, and I really believe she will be the next president of the United States.\"\n\n\"And the second thing is, I don't think the people of this country want to give more power to billionaires at this point,\" Mr. de Blasio added. \"I think that's what this election increasingly is about, how do we address income inequality, how do we restore the middle class? I don't think most Americans think that billionaires are the ones who are going to help give us a more fair economy.\"",
    " Title: U.S., Allies Accuse Russian Hackers of Targeting COVID-19 Vaccine Research Organizations\n\nIn a joint advisory issued on Thursday, U.S. security agencies, alongside their British and Canadian partners, have accused Russian hackers of targeting organizations involved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. The allegations have sparked condemnation on both sides of the Atlantic and warnings to companies about the potential theft of intellectual property related to the vaccine's development.\n\nThe hacking group, known by names such as \"APT29,\" \"The Dukes,\" and \"Cozy Bear,\" has reportedly targeted organizations in the U.S., Britain, and Canada with the \"highly likely\" intention of stealing vaccine-related intellectual property. The advisory, which did not name any targeted organizations or indicate specific data theft, did confirm that the hackers have successfully exploited known computer vulnerabilities to gain \"initial footholds\" within an unspecified number of organizations involved in fighting COVID-19.\n\nThe hackers are said to have used custom malware not previously associated with any campaigns attributed to the group, which has been active since at least 2008 and has been implicated in several high-profile intrusions, including the breach of the Democratic National Committee during the last U.S. presidential race.\n\nSen. Mark Warner (Virginia Democrat), ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, stated, \"It should be clear by now that Russia's hacking efforts didn't stop after the 2016 election. Moving forward, the United States and the western world need to be prepared for increasingly aggressive cyber-attacks from Russian actors.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California Republican) told The Times, \"These continued malicious actions to weaken our pandemic response must not go unchecked.\" He also plans to introduce legislation soon that would ensure the hackers are held responsible.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (California Democrat) urged President Trump to act and said he was asking for a briefing from his administration. \"There is no issue more critical to the health and safety of our nation and its citizens right now than testing, tracing, treating, and vaccinating,\" said Mr. Schiff. \"The consequences are literally life and death.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that the administration was aware of the activities included in Thursday's advisory, stating that the U.S. \"worked very closely with our allies\" to ensure COVID-19 vaccine research was protected.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the alleged attacks \"completely unacceptable,\" while Canada's Communications Security Establishment, one of the agencies that issued Thursday's advisory, stated that the attacks would \"hinder response efforts at a time when health care experts and medical researchers need every available resource.\"\n\nRussia has denied responsibility for the cyber spying campaign, as it has with other major computer intrusions blamed on President Vladimir Putin's regime. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \"We find such accusations unacceptable. We have no information on who could have hacked pharmaceutical companies and research centers in the U.K. We can say only one thing, Russia has nothing to do with these attempts.\"",

These efforts, so far, have resulted in only one openly rogue voter. The anticipated outcome, however, is met with some uncertainty by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nReince Priebus, the White House Chief of Staff in the incoming Trump administration, expressed confidence in a smooth process during an interview on \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday.\" Electors will convene in state capitals across the country to make the results of the Nov. 8 election official.\n\nIn most presidential election years, the Electoral College vote would be a formality. However, electors have been under pressure for weeks from anti-Trump forces to upend the November results, with protests also expected at state capitals on Monday.\n\nWhile these efforts stand little chance of success, they have been fueled by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's win in the popular vote. She won roughly 2.6 million more ballots than Trump but lost the Electoral College vote.\n\nTrump secured more Electoral College votes by winning many of the smaller, less-populated states in the Midwest and South, as well as the big coastal state of Florida and traditionally Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump and Clinton also split the six most populous states.\n\nTrump needs 270 electoral votes on Monday. With his state victories, he is on track to secure 306 of the 538 votes, with each state getting one vote for each House and Senate member. The three remaining votes go to the District of Columbia.\n\nPriebus, who still runs the Republican National Committee, which is keeping count of the apportioned or \"pledged\" votes, cited the only known and so-called \"faithless\" ballot-caster, a voter from Texas whose vote goes to Trump but plans to vote for another, yet-to-be-named Republican.\n\n\"But other than that, we're very confident that everything is going to be very smooth,\" said Priebus, noting a massive petition drive to get electoral voters to cast ballots against Trump and the alleged harassment of some of the voters, particularly in Arizona, where Trump won 49 percent of the vote, compared to 45 percent for Clinton, which entitles him to all 11 electoral votes.\n\nArizona elector Robert Graham told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday that the 11 electors have received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he's received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat.\n\n\"It's out of hand when you have such... a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\" said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \"The Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\"\n\nAll swore to party officials that they will back Trump, even though they're not legally bound to do so, and plan to hold to that pledge.\n\nTrump responded to the reports of elector harassment and intimidation on Sunday.\n\n\"If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!\"\n\nThere is no federal law on electoral votes. Some states bind their voters\u2014often state party officials\u2014to the popular vote. But the penalties for violations are minor, such as being disqualified from future balloting.\n\nOn Sunday, John Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, suggested that 37 electoral voters bound to Trump could defect, which would be enough to create at least a tie and send the vote to the GOP-controlled House, where Trump would still likely win.\n\nPodesta, as he has in recent days, pressed the argument on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Russians hacking the emails of Democrats during the election led in part to Clinton's loss. He also made a last-minute argument that members of the Electoral College should have an intelligence briefing about the hackings before voting on Monday.\n\n\"I assume that our electors are going to vote for Hillary Clinton,\" Podesta said. \"But the question is whether there are 37 Republican electors who think that either there are open questions [about the purported Russian hackings] or that Donald Trump\u2026is really unfit to be president... And I guess we will know that...tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Associated Press tried to reach all 538 electors and was able to interview more than 330 of them. Many reported getting tens of thousands of emails, calls, and letters asking them to vote against Trump. However, the canvass found overwhelming support for the system and the nominee among Republican electors. The AP found only one pledged to Trump who will refuse to vote for him but did not identify him as the voter in Texas.",
    " Title: State and Local Campaign Finance Reform Gains Momentum Amidst Federal Gridlock\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of a seemingly stagnant federal campaign finance reform landscape, efforts to curb political contributions and disclose their sources are gaining traction at the state and local levels. From the conservative statehouse in Texas to the liberal city council in Philadelphia, members of both parties are introducing and supporting bills aimed at reforming campaign finance.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, over 125 bills dealing with campaign finance reform have been introduced in 33 statehouses in the past five months. In addition, similar reforms have been proposed in cities across the country.\n\nA significant bipartisan victory for reform advocates came in April when Montana's Democratic Governor Steve Bullock collaborated with the GOP-controlled Legislature to pass a bill requiring all groups, including 501(c)(4)s, to disclose their donors if they spend money on targeting or supporting a candidate within 60 days of an election.\n\nPoliticians at the state and local levels, many of whom are wary of potential primary opponents funded by outside groups, point to polls showing overwhelming support for campaign finance reform. A recent New York Times/CBS poll found that 85 percent of those surveyed believe the system for funding political campaigns needs either \"fundamental changes\" or a complete overhaul. Moreover, Republicans were almost as likely as Democrats to favor further restrictions on campaign contributions.\n\nAdam Smith, spokesman for Every Voice, a nonprofit that works on campaign finance reform issues, stated, \"Everyone thinks, 'Oh, money in politics, so partisan.' It's partisan in Washington, but it's not partisan anywhere else.\"\n\nOn the federal level, since the Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited giving in the Citizens United v. FEC ruling, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has remained steadfastly against efforts to limit political contributions, making it difficult to garner GOP support on the issue.\n\nIn the absence of any hope for reform at the federal level, Democrats are joining Republicans in raising large sums of money, limiting the recent flurry of activity on the issue to states and cities. However, state and local activity is not without its challenges. For instance, in Texas, the state House passed a bill requiring disclosure, but the state Senate and Governor Greg Abbott opposed including the measure in an ethics package, upending the entire deal.\n\nShane Creamer, executive director of the Philadelphia Board of Ethics, noted, \"It's the gridlock at the [Federal Election Commission] that has left the cities and states to be the vanguard of the case law that has emerged since 2010.\"\n\nFEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel's candid interview with The New York Times, in which she stated that the likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim, has further highlighted the need for state and local action. In a highly unusual move, Ravel and another Democratic commissioner, Ellen Weintraub, filed a petition last week calling on their own agency to clamp down on political spending and demand disclosure.\n\nWith the FEC's six-member panel, split equally between Republicans and Democrats, in perpetual gridlock, Republicans on the state and local level have been particularly receptive to backing reform efforts aimed at providing the public with more disclosure, such as the bills in Texas and Montana, despite opposition from powerful groups like the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity.\n\nA new group, Take Back Our Republic, formed by John Pudner, who served as a political consultant to David Brat, the academic who ousted former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, is also trying to bring more conservatives on board with reform efforts. The group recently launched 17 chapters in states across the country.\n\nPudner stated, \"It seems to be the more conservative members who are most concerned. The issue has created a 'true left-right coalition' in many places.\"\n\nDale Eisman, spokesman for Common Cause, which has state chapters pushing for campaign finance reform across the country, pointed to polls showing strong support for at least disclosure\u2014if not other campaign finance reforms\u2014to explain recent GOP support. \"It's not surprising because every poll we see shows that the public is in strong support of disclosure,\" he said. \"The people want this. Legislators\u2014whether Republicans or Democrats\u2014if they want to do what their constituents want, should support disclosure.\"",
    " Title: Walmart Announces Changes to Firearm and Ammunition Sales Policy Following Recent Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to a series of mass shootings, including the tragic incident at one of its stores in Texas that left 22 dead, Walmart has announced it will discontinue the sale of certain types of ammunition and halt handgun sales in all stores, except for those in Alaska. The company's CEO, Doug McMillon, stated that the decision was made after listening to concerns about the status quo being unacceptable.\n\nIn a note to employees and on the firm's website, McMillon expressed that the company had been working to understand the issues arising from the recent shootings and the national discussion on gun violence. The firm also asked customers to stop openly carrying firearms in its Walmart and Sam's Club stores, even in states where it is legally permitted.\n\nThe move has received praise from celebrities, politicians, and several Democratic presidential candidates. However, the National Rifle Association (NRA) criticized the changes, calling them \"shameful\" and predicting a loss of business. Another major US retailer, Kroger, also announced changes to its policy, asking customers to stop openly carrying guns in stores where state laws allow it.\n\nWalmart's decision is expected to reduce the company's share of the ammunition market from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%. The company will continue to sell hunting rifles and shotguns, and much of the ammunition for those weapons. Walmart stock was little changed after the announcement, while shares in some gun-makers, such as Vista Outdoors, slumped.\n\nGuns and ammunition represent a tiny fraction of overall Walmart sales, according to Burt Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. He predicted the decision would pay off, allowing the retailer to provide more store space to faster-growing categories such as baby products.\n\nWalmart's competitive prices are likely to help it retain customers, regardless of their political leanings, Flickinger added. The company's decision follows two incidents at stores in August, in which a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, and a former employee killed two workers at a Walmart store in Mississippi.\n\nSince 1982, there have been more than 110 mass shootings in the US, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones. Walmart has lagged behind other US retailers in changes to its gun policies, with Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopping gun sales in 2018 after a mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida, and Dick's Sporting Goods ending the sale of assault weapons and raising the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases in the same year.\n\nThe move reflects a shift since Walmart stopped being a family-run company, according to Flickinger. \"It shows a very constructive change from a family-managed and run business,\" he said.",
    " Title: Seating Arrangement at G-20 Summit Highlights Tense U.S.-Russian Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, is set to bring together world leaders, with a seating arrangement that has sparked discussions about the state of U.S.-Russian relations. According to reports, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seated apart, with five leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, separating the two key adversaries over Syria and other contentious issues.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, in a story posted by Voice of America, notes that the seating arrangement is often a reflection of the real atmosphere between heads of state. The Russian organizers of the G-20 summit reportedly rewrote the seating plan using the Latin alphabet to ensure that Putin and Obama are not seated near each other.\n\nThe anticipated encounter between Obama and Putin has been described as awkward by Minnesota Public Radio's The Daily Circuit blog. NPR's Scott Horsley, who is covering Obama's trip to Europe, reports that the two leaders are expected to speak to each other at some point during the summit, but no lengthy discussions are anticipated.\n\nThe U.S.-Russian disagreement over Syria and the temporary asylum given to \"NSA leaker\" Edward Snowden by Russia have contributed to the frosty relationship between the two leaders. In the past, Obama had canceled a planned one-on-one summit with Putin and compared Putin's behavior at an earlier summit to that of a \"bored kid in the back of the classroom.\" However, Obama has also stated that he does not have a bad personal relationship with Putin, and that their conversations are candid, blunt, and often constructive.\n\nVoice of America adds that this is not the first time summit seating plans have been politicized. At a NATO Summit in Prague in 2002, NATO officials reportedly rewrote the seating arrangement in French to isolate then Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma at the far end of the table. The G-20 summit in St. Petersburg is set to begin on Thursday, with world leaders filing into the imperial Constantine Palace.",
    " Title: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Meet with Russian President Putin Amidst Syria Missile Controversy\n\nA daily summary of global reports on security issues\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, adding to the recent flurry of global diplomatic activity over the ongoing civil war in Syria. According to a Kremlin statement, the meeting will take place in Russia on Tuesday, with \"major attention\" to be paid to the current situation in the Middle East, particularly in Syria.\n\nThe meeting comes amidst reports that Netanyahu's trip was prompted by concerns that Russia was preparing to ship Syria S-300 surface-to-air missiles, which can defend against multiple aircraft and missiles. The missiles, whose shipment came to light last week, are a source of concern for both Israel \u2013 which has staged two airstrikes against targets in Syria in recent weeks \u2013 and for the US.\n\nRussia has been a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria as the civil war has unfolded, much to the consternation of the West and most Middle Eastern nations. Russia has countered that the West is fueling regional instability in its support for the rebels, particularly by empowering the Islamist elements therein.\n\nThe US and Israel have expressed their concerns over Russia's missile shipment to the Assad regime. US Secretary of State John Kerry told journalists during a visit to Italy that \"we have made it crystal clear that we would prefer that Russia is not supplying assistance\" to Syria. He added that the missiles are \"potentially destabilizing with respect to the state of Israel.\"\n\nThe introduction of the S-300 into Syria's air defense arsenal could sharply limit the future options not only for Israel but for the US as well, should it decide to intervene in the conflict.\n\nHowever, there is cautious optimism in some Western capitals over a planned international conference on Syria that both Moscow and Washington are organizing. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is visiting the White House today, is reportedly set to tell President Barack Obama that he believes Russia is prepared to adopt a more flexible approach to Syria, based on his meeting Friday with Putin in Sochi, Russia.\n\nCameron described his talks with Putin as \"extremely positive and good.\" He said, \"I was very heartened that while it is no secret that Britain and Russia have taken a different approach to Syria, I was very struck in my conversations with President Putin that there is a recognition that it would be in all our interests to secure a safe and secure Syria with a democratic and pluralistic future and end the regional instability.\"\n\nBut experts tell Agence France-Presse that they doubt the progress will amount to anything concrete. Stephen Sestanovich, an expert in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said this week's agreement on a peace conference \"moves the Geneva [peace plan] formula one step further, but what is one step beyond complete meaninglessness?\"\n\nSalman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said he was not convinced that the different players' positions had \"changed that much.\" Shaikh stressed that \"the situation on the ground\" \u2013 rather than diplomatic efforts \u2013 \"will continue to shape events.\"\n\nReuters notes that it is not yet clear whether the Syrian opposition will attend the US-Russia peace conference. The opposition coalition is set to meet on May 23 to determine whether it will attend, though the coalition itself remains split over the leadership of the group. Reuters writes that two factions, one backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the other by Qatar, are vying for control of the coalition.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Gang of Eight Senators Aim for Immigration Overhaul Draft Bill by End of the Week\n\nArticle:\n\nThe bipartisan Gang of Eight senators, a group of eight senators from seven states, is working towards finalizing a draft bill for immigration overhaul by the end of this week. However, Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the group, has stated that it is too soon to consider the deal struck, as the legislative language has not been fully drafted.\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, another member of the group, signaled on CNN's \"State of the Union with Candy Crowley\" that the deal will be reached within days, stating, \"It's got to be written up. We have not signed off. There are a few details yet, but conceptually - we have an agreement between business and labor, between ourselves. It has to be drafted. It will be rolled out next week.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, a key Democratic deal-maker in the process, concurred with the timeline but acknowledged a few issues that remain to be settled. \"As Sen. Rubio correctly says, we have said we will not come to final agreement until we look at all of the legislative language, and he's correctly pointing out that that language has not been fully drafted,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, another member of the group, also expressed optimism that a deal would be reached but noted, \"We've still got a ways to go with the language.\"\n\nThe Gang of Eight includes Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), John McCain (R-Arizona), Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey), in addition to Rubio, Graham, Schumer, and Flake.\n\nThe group's progress is significant, as they aim to restructure the current system for allocating U.S. visas, prioritizing visas for business purposes over visas for family members, and preventing a future wave of illegal immigration once the path to citizenship is implemented for those currently undocumented and in the U.S.\n\nThe consensus of business and labor groups, reached on Saturday, is crucial, as it means neither side will fight the bill, and a key goal of the Gang of Eight is to restructure the current system for allocating U.S. visas.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has described immigration as a top priority, but appears to have left the negotiating largely up to Capitol Hill, especially after a draft administration plan for immigration reform was reported publicly and drew criticism from Republicans, including Rubio.\n\nA White House official stated on Saturday that the president \"continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators.\" The official also expressed anticipation for the language once it is introduced and expects legislation to move forward as soon as possible.",
    " Title: Trump Presidency Puts Voting Rights in Peril as Supreme Court Shifts Right\n\nArticle:\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States has significant implications for the Supreme Court, as he is expected to fill the vacant seat left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia and potentially replace one or more of the court's liberal justices, such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. While same-sex marriage and abortion rights are currently shielded from immediate legal threats, the future of voting rights is in serious jeopardy under a Trump presidency.\n\nDale Ho, the director of the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union, expressed concern over the potential impact of a Trump presidency on voting rights. \"It's not the apocalypse yet,\" Ho said, \"but on voting, we're obviously not in as good a position as we expected to be in, and we're going to have to wait and see.\"\n\nHo cautioned supporters of voting rights not to lose hope, citing the Fifth Circuit Court's recent decision to strike down a restrictive Texas voter-ID law in July. The court's decision was made by nine out of its 15 judges, with five Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees backing the decision. This suggests, Ho said, that \"we have penetrated the consciousness of moderate conservatives on this issue.\"\n\nHowever, the possibility of Trump naming not just one but two right-wing justices to the high court creates two major sources of concern for voting rights advocates. The first is the current right-wing efforts to restrict voting rights, which have been on the rise in recent years. Ho noted that in 2013, Scalia joined the 5-4 majority in voting to weaken the Voting Rights Act. On the state level, there has been an onslaught of attacks on voting rights, from voter-ID and voter-registration restrictions to challenges of efforts to make the voting process itself easier.\n\nThe second problem for voting rights advocates under a Trump presidency is that it will be much harder to expand the franchise. Ho explained that there is a fledgling wave of efforts to challenge both partisan gerrymandering and felon disenfranchisement in the lower courts. Trump's election only diminishes the likelihood that the Supreme Court will agree to these efforts, such as the challenge to bar people from voting for life because they committed one felony in their youth.\n\nExisting restrictions on voting rights already in place did a lot to help elect Trump. As my colleague Matthew Rozsa reported, \"swing states were able to restrict the franchise in ways that may have been consequential in Trump's winning the Electoral College tally (he lost to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote).\"\n\nTrump campaigned on a platform that, at the very least, channeled and evoked white-nationalist sentiment. That dovetailed perfectly with restrictions on voting rights, which are often explicitly aimed at reducing the number of people of color who show up at the polls. In case there was any real hope that Trump did not mean all that racist stuff he said to get elected, his initial staffing decisions suggest he's dead serious about pursuing an agenda rooted in white-supremacist ideology.\n\nSteve Bannon, who served as the executive chairman for Breitbart News (frequently described as a white nationalist website) and then became CEO of the Trump campaign, has now been appointed as Trump's chief White House strategist. This move cements Bannon's role as the Joseph Goebbels of the Trump operation and suggests that white nationalist ideology will be central to the Trump administration. In addition, Trump has hired for his transition team Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state with a long career of working against immigrant rights and voting rights.\n\nVoter suppression is about winning elections, but it's also about racism. In North Carolina, a voter-suppression law was struck down by the Fourth Circuit Court in August. In its decision, the court said that the law targeted \"African Americans with almost surgical precision.\" Four Supreme Court justices were ready to side with the state and against the circuit court. But with Scalia's seat vacant, there was no fifth vote in favor of this overtly racist law.\n\nWith Trump at the helm and his well-documented enthusiasm for racism in play, getting a fifth vote to further restrict voting rights in the future is much less likely to be a problem.",
    " Title: Obama Family's Final Christmas Weekly Address: Emphasizing Service, Unity, and Gratitude\n\nIn their final Christmas Weekly Address as the First Family, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama reflected on their eight-year tenure in the White House, emphasizing the themes of service, unity, and gratitude.\n\nThe First Lady, in a nod to the challenges of their first Christmas address, acknowledged that her husband, the President, \"needed all the help he could get.\" She reminisced about the privileges of celebrating the holidays in the White House, including welcoming over half a million guests, baking 200,000 holiday cookies, and the President's famous dad jokes.\n\nThe White House holiday theme for this year is \"The Gift of the Holidays,\" and the decorations reflect the nation's greatest gifts, such as the resilience of military families and the transformative impact of education.\n\nPresident Obama highlighted the achievements of their administration, including economic recovery, health insurance reform, and environmental protection. He expressed hope that the progress made would continue in the years to come.\n\nThe Obamas also emphasized the importance of service, particularly during the holiday season. They encouraged Americans to support military families, veterans, and service members through the JoiningForces.gov website.\n\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, the Obamas emphasized the eternal message of love, compassion, and hope, drawing from the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. They emphasized the values of empathy, kindness, and service, which they believe are shared by Americans of all faiths and backgrounds.\n\nThe First Lady concluded by expressing hope for a happy and healthy 2017, and the President signed off with a Merry Christmas to everyone. The Obamas also wished their fellow Americans a happy and healthy New Year, and expressed their gratitude.",
    " Title: Low Trust in Government: A Self-Defeating Spiral and the Need for a More Effective State\n\nAccording to Gallup and other polling organizations, Americans have record or near-record low rates of confidence in government. In the second quarter of President Donald Trump's term, only 39% of Americans approved of his performance, a significant drop from the historical average. Trust in public schools, the criminal justice system, and Congress also remains low, with only 36% having a great deal of faith in public schools, 26% trusting the criminal justice system, and 12% expressing confidence in Congress. Trust in most major institutions is lower than it was a decade ago.\n\nLibertarians and other skeptics of government see this trend as a sign that people are finally waking up to reality. However, there are good reasons to be concerned about persistently low levels of trust and confidence in government. Researchers have found that people in countries with bad governments often desire more government intervention in all aspects of their lives, despite their lack of trust in the government's ability to be fair or effective. A 2010 study found that 82% of former East Germans and 92% of Russians, two famously \"low-trust\" populations, favored wage controls. In contrast, residents in Scandinavia and North America, which are \"high-trust\" regions, were far more trusting of market forces.\n\nIt appears that government may be growing not in spite of our lack of confidence in it, but because of our lack of confidence in it. This self-defeating spiral will only get worse if the United States fails to stem its slide toward being a low-trust country.\n\nThe solution to this does not have to be nihilism or anarchy. Instead, we need a government that does fewer things but does them better. Government spending is already at an already swollen 21% of GDP and is predicted to climb to 30% over the next three decades. Libertarians rightly want a limited government, and we should fight to end cronyism, drug prohibition, and regulatory overreach that increases the cost of doing business. We need to keep pushing back against defense spending wasted on elective wars and national security measures that put us under surveillance without making us safer.\n\nHowever, we should also point to places where government action is both legitimate and effective and praise policies, like school choice, for instance, that deliver better results at cheaper costs. Ironically, if we can get more people to trust the government, it just might be easier to shrink the size, scope, and spending of the state.

    " Title: Mnuchin's Senate Confirmation Hearing: A Cautious and Controversial Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nSteven Mnuchin's five-hour Senate confirmation hearing has concluded, marking a potentially challenging experience for the nominee, who faced a barrage of tough questions from Democrats regarding his business background, investment holdings, and financial disclosures.\n\nIn contrast to his two television interviews in November, following Donald Trump's announcement of Mnuchin as his pick, where Mnuchin provided detailed policy discussions, the nominee was more reserved on policy matters during today's hearing. He endeavored to soften some of the more contentious statements made by President-elect Trump on tariffs, the dollar, and the U.S. debt.\n\nMnuchin adopted positions that align closely with outgoing Treasury Secretary's views, such as the urgent need to raise the debt limit when its current suspension expires in March and to bolster staffing at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nIn other policy areas, Mnuchin was cautious to adopt moderate positions without completely deviating from the Republican orthodoxy. For instance, on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he expressed support for maintaining the bureau but suggested changes to its funding mechanism, a move that has raised concerns among some Democrats about potential funding constraints.\n\nOn the Volcker Rule, Mnuchin supported the rule's objective but outlined changes that its proponents argue would weaken it. Although he appeared to distance himself from past support for privatizing mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, he acknowledged their importance to the mortgage market and their past valuable roles.\n\nDemocrats attempted to capitalize on disclosures that Mnuchin failed to make to the committee until committee staffers pointed out the oversights. Mnuchin attributed these errors to paperwork issues. They also sought to question Mnuchin about potential conflicts of interest arising from Donald Trump's failure to place his extensive real-estate holdings into a blind trust.\n\nRepublicans seemed unperturbed by these issues, with the exception of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who expressed concern over Mnuchin's lack of response to earlier questions about his foreclosure record at OneWest Bank in his home state.",
    " Title: Graham-Cassidy Bill: Latest Attempt to Repeal Obamacare Faces Uncertain Future in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Graham-Cassidy bill, the latest attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), is facing an uncertain future in the Senate. The revised bill allows states to set higher health insurance premiums based on a person's health status, but not on the basis of sex or genetic information.\n\nUnder the bill, state officials would be required to describe how they would maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, changes to the bill's funding formula to win over Senator Lisa Murkowski might cost it support among conservatives, and the hasty revisions could strengthen concerns that Congress is moving forward with a bill that has not been properly vetted.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office is set to release a partial analysis of the bill's impact as soon as Monday, but that report may not include the latest changes. President Trump, speaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, seemed to be looking ahead to the next big legislative goal for Republicans\u2014overhauling the tax code\u2014even as he talked up the Graham-Cassidy bill and applied pressure to resistant senators.\n\nThe architects of the latest repeal plan, Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, were not giving up. \"We're moving forward, and we'll see what happens next week,\" said Senator Graham on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I'm very excited about it. We finally found an alternative to Obamacare that makes sense.\"\n\nWhite House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that a Senate vote was planned for this week, but a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to confirm that timeline on Sunday. The Graham-Cassidy bill aims to repeal the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, as well as the tax credits that are provided to help people buy insurance on the individual market. In their place, it would provide block grants to the states to use for healthcare.\n\nThe bill's future remains uncertain, as it must win the support of 50 of the Senate's 52 Republicans, a goal that has proven elusive in the past. The bill's impact on healthcare coverage, costs, and access for millions of Americans will be closely watched in the coming days and weeks.",
    " Title: Senate to Confirm Three Obama Nominees This Week, Signaling Potential Cooperation in the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is set to approve three more of President Barack Obama's nominees this week, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. In a statement on Wednesday, Reid expressed optimism that Fred Hochberg will be confirmed to head the Export-Import Bank, Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and Tom Perez to helm the Labor Department by the end of business on Thursday.\n\nA leadership aide indicated that Hochberg's confirmation is likely to occur on Wednesday, with final approval for McCarthy and Perez potentially coming as early as Thursday, depending on the amount of debate time requested by the Republicans. Typically, the Senate adjourns for the weekend on Thursday afternoons, suggesting that the three nominations will likely be concluded before Friday morning.\n\nThis progress on the long-delayed nominations follows the approval of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday. The agreement to vote on these nominees, as well as three candidates for the National Labor Relations Board, is the result of a deal reached on Tuesday between Reid and Republicans to avoid an unprecedented Senate rules change.\n\nReid had previously threatened to alter the Senate's rules to advance those nominations in the face of Republican filibusters. However, the \"nuclear option\" of changing the voting threshold on some of Obama's picks from 60 to 51 was averted. Instead, senators agreed to fill the NLRB and allow Hochberg, McCarthy, Perez, and Cordray to proceed without a change to the Senate rules.\n\nReid expressed hope that this agreement marks a new era of cooperation in the Senate, stating, \"We have now started a new era, I hope a new normal in the Senate where senators talk to each other rather than past each other.\"",

This week, President Trump added his voice to the debate, expressing his hope that the Democrats would not force Pelosi out, stating that it would be detrimental for the Republican Party and that he hoped for the continued presence of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nPelosi responded to Trump's comments later that morning, dismissing them as typical Republican rhetoric and suggesting that the President was provided the statement by members of his party. \"He then added the Chuck Schumer bit,\" she said at a briefing.\n\nPelosi defended her position and asserted her status as a master legislator and politically astute leader. While she acknowledged and respected the opinions of her caucus members, she emphasized that the decision regarding her tenure was not in their hands.\n\nSince Jon Ossoff's loss to Karen Handel on Tuesday night, a few congressional Democrats have called for a change in the top leadership within the caucus. Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts have expressed their desire for new leadership, with Rice stating, \"We need leadership change. It's time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas suggested that winning the House in 2018 would be impossible with Pelosi in charge. \"Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost,\" Vela said. \"But she certainly is one of the reasons.\"\n\nDespite the calls for change and the recent loss, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, expressed optimism about the possibility of Democrats winning enough seats for a House majority in 2018.",
    " Title: A Call to Unity and Resilience: The 2016 Election and the Defense of the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the new year approaches, it is essential to reflect on the state of our nation and the lessons we have learned over the past seven years. The political landscape has been marked by significant challenges, and many attribute these difficulties to the policies and approach of the current administration. However, it is crucial to recognize the resilience of the American people and the strength of the Founding Fathers' foundation for the nation.\n\nThe Constitution and our founding documents have served as a bulwark against the forces that seek to undermine our nation. The left's calls for constitutional changes or amendments to create \"safe spaces\" have been met with resistance, a testament to the enduring power of our original documents.\n\nThe task ahead in 2016 is to remain focused and disciplined, recognizing that this is not a fight for one person, but the defense of the nation. The American people have sent clear messages of discontent to Washington and the establishment, and it appears that we are on the brink of wresting our great nation from politicians who view it as their personal property.\n\nThe state of the nation and the world is a result of the actions of career politicians who have facilitated this disaster by going along to get along. We have faced an array of challenges, including the childish and incompetent destruction of our health insurance and health care system, leftist bullies on college campuses, open borders, Islamic State plots in all 50 states, urban riots against the police, historically high numbers of Americans off the work rolls, and on food stamps, among others.\n\nThe establishment's response to this serious rebellion by the hoi polloi is evident in the comments of two long-time Republican operatives. Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant, stated that the donor class must \"put a bullet in Donald Trump\" to prevent his nomination. Pat Brady, the Illinois co-chairman for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign, suggested that taking on Donald Trump requires \"taking him out with a head shot.\"\n\nDespite the establishment's attempts to discredit the candidates rising in the polls, the strength of real estate mogul Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz is undeniable. The truth is, Republicans are not horribly divided or fearful; they are angry and concerned. They are tired of being lied to and watching their future being washed away by disconnected, self-obsessed politicians. Replacing failed leadership is not an abandonment of the system that the Founding Fathers put in place\u2014it's a restoration.\n\nThis is the goal of 2016. It is clear, straightforward, and undeniable. This is our generation's challenge, our Yorktown, our arrival on the beaches at Normandy. We must get it right, and if history is any indication, we will. As British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said, \"You can always count on Americans to do the right thing\u2014after they've tried everything else.\" Here's to 2016.",
    " Title: Easing the Path to Bankruptcy for Small Businesses: A Potential Solution to the Economic Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, small businesses are facing an unprecedented crisis. These businesses, which account for more than 99 percent of all businesses in the U.S. and close to 50 percent of all employment, are at the highest risk of failure due to the nationwide practice of social distancing.\n\nThe $2 trillion economic relief package, which has passed the Senate and is currently in the House, includes measures to help small businesses weather this difficult time, notably a $367 billion loan program. However, more specific and immediate steps the federal government can take to help America's small-business owners are necessary.\n\nOne such step is easing the path to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In normal times, small businesses have a high failure rate, with only about 50 percent surviving the first five years and only 30 percent surviving longer than 10 years. America's bankruptcy system allows these failed entrepreneurs a \"fresh start.\"\n\nThe concept of a fresh start works especially well for owners of small businesses. By wiping out debts and pardoning failure, American bankruptcy law gives the entrepreneur a chance to bounce back. When businesses fail, entrepreneurs can shield some or all of their assets from creditors by filing under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy laws, the usual route for consumer filings. In 2016, more than 60 percent of bankruptcy cases filed were Chapter 7 claims. Most importantly, entrepreneurs can get an exemption for equity in owner-occupied homes through the homestead exemption. They are also released from any future obligation to repay debts.\n\nHowever, there is a lack of consistent bankruptcy policy across the states, and that creates an unintended barrier to small business owners who need relief. Since the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978 was enacted, bankruptcy exemption levels are set by the states and vary widely across states and over time. For example, in seven states or regions (and the U.S. territories of the American Samoa and Puerto Rico), the homestead exemptions are unlimited. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they are zero. All other states lie somewhere in between.\n\nThere are also personal property exemptions for items like motor vehicles and jewelry. Research, including mine, shows that the lower the exemptions, the smaller the likelihood of business start-ups in that state. Not surprisingly, the threat of losing their home and property at the time of bankruptcy creates a deterrence to individuals starting a business in the state.\n\nOther bankruptcy routes include Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, which are reorganization procedures. While Chapter 7 is the usual route for consumer filings, Chapter 13 is available to individuals with regular income and sole proprietors, and Chapter 11 is typically available to corporations or partnerships. The amount of debt discharged approaches that under Chapter 7, but both procedures require the debtor to establish a repayment plan paid for with future income.\n\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) with the primary intention of making it harder for individuals to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The reform introduced a means test for Chapter 7, which essentially prevented individuals earning above-average income from wiping out their debt through filing under Chapter 7. Instead, such individuals would be able to file under Chapter 13, which allows debt discharge only after the individual has made some repayments. That process can be cumbersome and bogs down entrepreneurs for months or even years as they work to repay their debts. It feels especially unfair to require it of businesses that shuttered through no fault of their own.\n\nBAPCPA also lowered exemptions for certain assets, and debtors now need to undergo credit counseling before filing\u2014a costly process and, for many business owners, not particularly useful. My research suggests a modest but unarguably negative impact from some of these changes on small-firm entry decisions. Others find a 50 percent reduction in Chapter 7 filings after the act's passage, and a 25 percent increase in insolvency, leading to worse outcomes for financially distressed borrowers.\n\nWhile these provisions may work to reduce bankruptcy abuse in normal economic times, these are not normal economic times. It is in the taxpayers' interest to do everything reasonably possible to protect small businesses\u2014responsible for creating millions of jobs\u2014from going under. The relief package that is expected to pass soon includes measures that will give direct cash to Americans, which will help them pay for expenses as they lose jobs and incomes. There are also expanded unemployment benefits for workers. And finally, there are billions of dollars in loans to small businesses. These are laudable efforts. However, many small businesses will fail in the next few months, despite these efforts.\n\nAllowing small businesses to have an easier path to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy could provide them a fresh start when the crisis is over. By easing the costs associated with a Chapter 7 filing, removing means-tested filing for a temporary period, and allowing more individuals and small businesses to file and claim unlimited homestead and personal property exemptions for a temporary period, we can provide greater protections to the assets of small business owners. Our entrepreneurial system is dynamic, and there is significant churn with businesses dying and re-entering. Perhaps the best solution to the current crisis, when efforts at helping businesses stay afloat don't work, is easing the path to bankruptcy. This would allow for a fresh start after the tumult has passed.\n\nAparna Mathur is a Resident Scholar in Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
    " Title: US-North Korea Summit: Negotiations Resume as Trump and Kim Jong-un Prepare for Possible Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and North Korea are engaging in negotiations at the Panmunjom village in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, signaling a potential revival of the planned summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The talks, led by Sung Kim, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, aim to set an agenda for the highly anticipated meeting, which was initially called off by President Trump last week due to North Korea's perceived hostility.\n\nOn Saturday, Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held an unannounced meeting, with Mr. Moon reporting that the North Korean leader reaffirmed his commitment to a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Kim later expressed his \"fixed will\" for the summit to proceed, and Trump tweeted on Sunday that the meeting would help the North achieve its \"brilliant potential.\"\n\nDespite the optimistic tone, there is still a significant amount of work to be done, and President Trump has made it clear that he will not attend the summit if he believes a deal cannot be reached. It remains uncertain whether Kim Jong-un will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, as similar commitments in the past have not been upheld.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the U.S. had initially sought denuclearization as a prerequisite, followed by rewards such as lifted sanctions and economic aid. However, North Korea has indicated a preference for a phased approach, with its steps being met by reciprocal ones from the U.S. and South Korea, primarily on sanctions but also regarding the U.S. military presence in South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has been subject to international sanctions since 2006, which have significantly limited its exports and oil imports. The North is also seeking assurances that its existence as a state will not be threatened.\n\nThe recent thaw in relations between the two countries is surprising, given that North Korea maintained its aggressive rhetoric and continued with nuclear and missile tests throughout 2016 and 2017. This led to a bitter war of words between Trump and the North Korean leadership. However, a rapprochement began in January when Kim Jong-un expressed openness to dialogue with South Korea.\n\nIn February, the two countries marched under a unified flag at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, held in the South. Kim announced a suspension of nuclear tests and held a landmark summit with Moon Jae-in last month. This week, North Korea claimed to have dismantled its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, although scientists believe it partially collapsed after the last test in September 2017.",
    " Title: Clinton's Challenges in Mobilizing Voters Beyond Primary Election\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats are currently grappling with concerns over Hillary Clinton's ability to appeal to Bernie Sanders' supporters in the general election, with speculations about Sanders potentially hindering Clinton's prospects to advance his own agenda. However, history suggests there is little reason for worry, as candidates typically fight hard until they stop fighting, as demonstrated by Clinton herself in 2008.\n\nThe real challenge for Clinton lies not in reaching out to Sanders' supporters but in mobilizing the larger universe of left-of-center voters who did not participate in the primary elections. In 2008, Barack Obama garnered 17.5 million votes, and Clinton lost despite winning about 260,000 more votes. To win, Clinton needs to mobilize not just Sanders' supporters but the much larger pool of left-of-center voters who did not vote in the primaries.\n\nThe Clinton-Sanders race is not as close as the 2008 contest, but it is a lower-turnout affair. Sanders has about 10 million votes, and Clinton has about 13 million. Both numbers will increase once California and New Jersey vote, but they are not expected to reach the levels seen in 2008.\n\nGeneral election winners need way more votes than the combined Clinton-Sanders total. Obama got 66 million votes in 2012, George W. Bush got 62 million votes in 2004, and even in the low-turnout three-way race of 1992, when the population was lower, Bill Clinton got 45 million votes.\n\nThe people who voted for Sanders in the primary are some of the lowest-hanging fruit for Clinton, as they are already registered to vote and are taking an unusually high level of interest in politics. Their names and contact information will be on Sanders' campaign lists, and Sanders will be endorsing Clinton and campaigning for her.\n\nThe real problem lies in reaching the legions of people with left-of-center political views who are less attached to the political process than actual Bernie Sanders voters. Younger people and nonwhites, in particular, seem less connected to the political process and more willing to stay home from the polls.\n\nClinton's weakness with young voters was evident in both the 2008 and 2016 primaries. To win, she needs to reach a lot of young people who have not stirred themselves to vote for Sanders, which is a harder challenge.\n\nDemocrats' current hope is that fear of Donald Trump will be an excellent motivator to drive turnout among the Obama coalition of minority groups and young people. However, it is far from clear that this sort of negative focus is a successful voter turnout strategy.\n\nVoting is not a very rational course of action, and the odds that one's decision to vote or stay home will actually be the difference between Donald Trump ending up in or out of the White House are incredibly small. People vote for the same kinds of reasons that they attend political rallies\u2014we are communal beings, and it's nice to sometimes take part in larger activities.\n\nClinton, who would be the first woman president if elected, certainly has the potential to play a significant role in people's thinking. However, her generally low approval ratings, the fact that she is getting fewer votes than she did eight years ago, and her weak performance in the primary with young women are all signs that she is struggling in practice to do it.\n\nThe best news for Clinton is that Trump is viewed even less favorably by the public and will face his own massive challenges in securing Republican turnout. However, the basic dynamics of a race to the bottom in terms of voter enthusiasm are not all that favorable to Democrats, as we have seen in the past two midterm elections. The map we see every presidential election is pretty much useless.",
    " Title: The Urgent Need for Amending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to Protect Viewpoint Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nAn escalating issue of viewpoint discrimination in the workplace is gaining traction across the United States, threatening not only individuals' jobs and livelihoods but also the fabric of our civic life. This issue, distinct from discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, targets employees whose political views are deemed unacceptable by a newly energized and seemingly dominant \"woke\" movement.\n\nCurrently, the Civil Rights Act does not protect individuals from viewpoint discrimination, leaving them vulnerable when employers dismiss them or overlook them for promotions and hiring, as the employers face no legal repercussions. This legal loophole has granted the \"woke\" movement unprecedented power to dictate employment decisions.\n\nThe phenomenon, often referred to as cancel culture, is not about censorship but self-censorship. People are reluctant to express their opinions on crucial public matters due to the fear of losing their jobs and the inability to provide for their families. This situation is a stark departure from the American values of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nTo address this issue, it is proposed that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act be amended to include a new category: \"viewpoints or beliefs.\" This amendment would ensure that employers face a choice between yielding to the threatening \"woke\" mob and terminating an employee who can legally challenge viewpoint discrimination.\n\nThe absence of such antidiscrimination protection in the civil-rights law is surprising, considering the significance of the right to hold views and beliefs without facing economic and social hardship. Currently, only four states and the District of Columbia have viewpoint-discrimination protections in their laws, leaving 46 states without such protection.\n\nThe consequences of this legal void extend beyond employment decisions. The \"woke\" movement's ability to obstruct or ruin careers has created a climate of fear and repression, particularly among young people who are cautious about expressing their opinions to avoid career damage.\n\nThis issue transcends political ideologies, with the exception of the extreme left and the libertarian fringe. It is crucial to amend the Civil Rights Act to safeguard freedom of speech, the foundational right from which all others flow. This amendment would serve as a potent remedy against the cancel culture.\n\nMichael Schwartz, of counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, expressed these views. The opinions expressed are his own.",
    " Title: Michael Oren: Boston Bombing and Terrorism: A Shared Experience Between Americans and Israelis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, has emphasized the shared experience between Americans and Israelis in the face of terrorism. Oren stated that the horrendous attack sought to instill fear and inflict trauma, but both nations refuse to submit.\n\nOren, speaking at a conference, highlighted that the purpose of terror is to terrorize. Despite the ongoing investigation into the responsible parties, the bombing aimed to paralyze the city, inflict debilitating trauma, and force people to forfeit their freedom. However, Oren asserted, we cannot let terror win.\n\nHe pointed out that both the United States and Israel live in open societies that enable them to celebrate their freedom. Whether it's arts festivals, sporting events, craft fairs, or simply playing with children in the park, they are upholding those liberties in the face of those seeking to deny them.\n\nOren emphasized that while defending these freedoms, sometimes through men and women in uniform, most poignantly, it's the people refusing to succumb to fear that beat terror. The people of Boston, who were celebrating liberty's birthday on the day of the bombing, will not submit.\n\nOren shared that the experience in Israel has taught them that communities and caregivers, police and security forces, elected leaders, and volunteers can unite at such times and block the terrorists from achieving their objectives. While taking all possible measures to prevent further loss of life, they adamantly refuse to forfeit their way of life.\n\nOren also acknowledged the pain of the victims and their families, as well as the emotional damage inflicted on countless citizens. He emphasized that at such times, communities can band together and help bind the psychological and physical wounds. When first responders rush through the smoke, risking their own lives to assist the fallen, the healing process begins.\n\nOren concluded by reminding us of the best in humanity, citing the heroic first responders, the athletes who ran to the hospital to donate blood, and the countless other acts of selflessness that remind us of the American spirit and its capacity to overcome terror and emerge stronger.\n\nIn a poignant message, Oren called on Americans and Israelis to remember the victims, but stand together and refuse to be victimized by terrorism.",
    " Title: Mexico President Responds to U.S. Tariff Threat, Vows to Negotiate and Maintain Diplomatic Tone\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a public letter released late Thursday, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, often referred to as AMLO, expressed his desire to avoid a confrontation with the United States, but criticized President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexican goods as a \"fallacy.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Trump announced that on June 10, the United States will impose a 5% tariff on all goods coming into the country from Mexico, escalating by 5 percentage points each month until \"the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,\" at which point it will be removed, potentially reaching 25% by October 1.\n\nIn response, AMLO said, \"With all due respect, although you have the right to express it, 'America First' is a fallacy because until the end of times, even beyond national borders, justice and universal fraternity will prevail.\"\n\nWhile not citing the letter specifically, Trump defended his proposal in Friday morning tweets, blaming Mexico and congressional Democrats for the migrant problems on the border. \"Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,\" Trump tweeted, claiming that \"Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S.\" and \"they can easily fix this problem.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump claimed that companies would leave Mexico to avoid the tariffs, but it should not come to that. \"Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels,\" he said in a tweet. \"The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!\"\n\nTrump did not define what a sufficient solution would be to stop the wave after wave of Central American migrants journeying through Mexico to reach the U.S. southern border. Through the first seven months of the 2019 fiscal year, U.S. Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 280,000 migrants entering the country illegally who are minors or members of family units. Of those, 97% are from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and only 3% are from Mexico, according to Border Patrol data.\n\nIn his written statement, Trump also said, \"Workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage.\"\n\nIn his public letter responding to Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador said Mexico is already doing what it can to stop the migration, and added that \"social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures.\" He said he is developing plans with Central America and told Trump, \"Please, remember that I do not lack valor, that I am not a coward nor timorous but rather act according to principles.\"\n\nCiting the United States' history as a nation of immigrants, L\u00f3pez Obrador also told Trump, \"The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol.\"",

    " Title: Iowa Senate Race Remains Tight as Ernst and Braley Battle for Undecided Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest poll in the Iowa Senate race indicates that the contest remains a dead heat, with Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley separated by a margin of two points, 45-43, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. The poll's margin of error suggests that the race could still tilt the balance of power in Washington in a year when Republicans are favored to take back the Senate.\n\nThe survey of 967 likely voters in Iowa echoes two other nonpartisan polls this month, which also showed Ernst with a razor-thin one- to two-point edge. As the two candidates gear up for the November 4 election, they will focus on winning over undecided voters and the 10 percent of likely voters who said they could still change their mind.\n\nWhile the overall numbers do not appear to be shifting significantly, Braley's campaign can take solace in the pulse of Independents, which shows a big swing in independent support. Braley converted a seven-point deficit in Quinnipiac's September poll into a five-point lead among this key voter bloc, with Braley now leading independents 48% to Ernst's 43%.\n\nBraley also continues to pick up support among women, who favor him over his female GOP foe by a 13-point margin. Ernst, on the other hand, maintains her lead among men at 56% to Braley's 39%.\n\n\"Voters are choosing partisanship over gender when it comes to making their ballot choice,\" Quinnipiac University Polling Director Peter Brown said in a release.\n\nErnst may also benefit from the expected 15-point lead of Republican Governor Terry Branstad, according to the Quinnipiac poll. The race between Ernst and Braley will likely be a closely watched contest in the upcoming midterm elections.",
    " Title: NBC's Portrayal of Obama's ISIS Interview Sparks Controversy: Critics Accuse Network of Spinning President's Remarks as \"Candid\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, NBC's Today show on Monday portrayed President Obama's admission of underestimating the threat of ISIS as a \"very candid\" admission by the commander-in-chief. This characterization has been met with criticism from various quarters, with some accusing the network of spinning the President's remarks to deflect blame from his administration.\n\nCo-host Matt Lauer opened the show by stating, \"Underestimated. The President admits his administration and U.S. intelligence officials misjudged the threat of ISIS.\" However, a soundbite of the President distancing himself from blame followed, with Obama stating, \"I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.\"\n\nLater, Lauer introduced the story, declaring, \"President Obama acknowledging in a new interview that U.S. officials underestimated ISIS and overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to take on the terror group.\" In the report that followed, chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel announced, \"This seemed to be a very candid interview, the President blamed the former U.S.-backed Iraqi government for allowing ISIS to flourish and said American intelligence did not fully appreciate the threat.\"\n\nHowever, this portrayal of the interview has been met with skepticism. On Sunday, The Daily Beast's Eli Lake criticized Obama's attempt to blame the intelligence community for dropping the ball on ISIS, stating, \"Either the president does not read the intelligence he's getting or he's bullshitting.\"\n\nFurthermore, on August 10, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell appeared on Meet the Press and similarly dismantled the President's claims of being in the dark about ISIS. On September 3, Engel himself appeared on Mitchell's MSNBC show and explained, \"President Obama says he has no strategy yet for Syria. This has been going on for over three years. The buildup of ISIS has not been rapid, it has been quite slow. It has been quite well-documented...\"\n\nGiven NBC's own reporting on how Obama knew about the ISIS build-up all along, how could the network describe the President passing the blame as \"very candid\"?\n\nOn ABC's Good Morning America on Monday, co-host George Stephanopoulos tried to push similar spin regarding Obama's remarks to 60 Minutes, stating, \"... the President pretty frank about what went wrong here.\" However, White House correspondent Jon Karl called out the presidential blame game, stating, \"The President bluntly acknowledged that the United States got it wrong... But, George, even as he acknowledged this... the President made it clear this was a mistake made by the intelligence community, he was not taking personal responsibility here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, CBS This Morning led with a clip of Obama's exchange with 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft, then at the top of the 8 a.m. ET hour brought on Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan to offer criticism of the President's handling of ISIS. After Ryan pointed out \"colossal mistakes in our Iraq and Syria policy that led to this emergence of ISIS,\" including not arming moderate Syrian rebels earlier, co-host Charlie Rose pinned the blame on the President, stating, \"Why do you think he did not?... When Petraeus, Clinton, and others were saying, 'We're looking at the same facts and have a different decision'... And we should have done it and there would have been an opportunity to stop ISIS.\"\n\nIn light of these criticisms, it remains to be seen whether NBC's portrayal of President Obama's interview will continue to face scrutiny."
