    " Title: U.S. Accuses China of Intellectual Property Theft: A Look at China's Innovation and the Quest for Truth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Pentagon has accused China of stealing innovative ideas from American industries for strategic gain. This allegation, while not new in business circles, marks a significant escalation as the U.S. government has made it official and explicit. The question now is, why does China resort to such systematic pilfering, through cyber-espionage, reverse engineering, and other means of intellectual property theft?\n\nIndustrial theft is prevalent in almost every country, including the U.S. However, in China, it is on such a high scale and at such an official level that the U.S. government has felt compelled to point a finger at Beijing. According to one American think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, China's stealing of U.S. intellectual property cost nearly 1 million U.S. jobs in 2009.\n\nDespite China's significant government investments in 'independent innovation,' such as science parks and 'hot' industries like clean energy, the country's approach to innovation remains questionable. China produces far more engineers than the U.S. and has a higher investment in research as a percent of gross domestic product. However, its top scientific universities have gained global respect due to their research output, not necessarily their quality.\n\nCreativity and a quest for truth are universal, not unique to any particular people. Research in science and technology requires an open, honest, and fearless attitude, as expressed by Chinese physicist Fang Lizhi in his autobiography. Fang, a strongly independent intellectual, criticized the suppression of truth by China's Communist Party and the country's supercompetitive education system that encourages rote learning over creative thinking.\n\nChina's top-down economic planning and its domineering state-run enterprises also don't encourage a Steve Jobs-type figure to emerge. An official policy since 2006 to quickly innovate Chinese industry has led to high rates of plagiarism in scientific papers and other misconduct in research labs. While the quantity of such research papers is higher, the quality is low.\n\nChina's long dependency on foreign technology and its drive to develop its economy quickly may be one reason for its lingering tendency to take other people's creative work. However, it could also be that a people living under a ruling party that suppresses the truth don't feel safe in striving for truth. India, which has far less government money for research, does very well in its open society to inspire technological innovation.\n\nTruth-seeking has a long tradition in the West, where religion focuses on the idea of a rational Creator. Physicist Stephen Hawking speaks of his desire to understand the universe as a search for \"the mind of God.\" China also has a long history of importing ideas \u2013 Mao Zedong imported communism, for example, and Deng Xiaoping brought in Western-style market capitalism. The quest for truth is not alien to the country. China now simply needs to look to its own people for creativity rather than take it from elsewhere.",
    " Title: White House Security Clearance Process Under Fire as Career Bureaucrats Allegedly Delay and Obstruct Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House security clearance process has become a contentious issue, with allegations that a small group of career bureaucrats in the Old Executive Office Building are intentionally delaying and obstructing the process to hinder President Trump's agenda and prevent the installation of his appointees.\n\nSean M. Bigley, a federal security clearance lawyer representing several senior administration officials caught up in the process, claims that these bureaucrats are weaponizing the security clearance process to thwart the president's agenda and prevent the installation of appointees who will execute it.\n\n\"The security clearance process is being weaponized by anti-Trump bureaucrats who are using it as a tool to not only thwart the president's agenda but to prevent him from installing appointees who will execute it,\" Mr. Bigley told The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThis account of obstruction and stalling tactics supports White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly's criticism of the security office and further illuminates recent incidents involving security clearances that have embarrassed Mr. Trump, including a downgrade of top-secret clearance for senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe foot-dragging in the security clearance process is prevalent throughout the administration, including at the Defense Department, but it is most visible and startling at the White House. Completed FBI background checks routinely get snagged by the office, also known as EOP Security, which is manned by fewer than a dozen career officials.\n\nThe office has a reputation for bureaucratic inefficiency stretching back several administrations, but it now has adopted an adversarial stance toward Mr. Trump. \"There really is a hostility and there seems to be almost an institutional arrogance in lack of willingness to engage,\" said Mr. Bigley. \"I literally can not get a phone call returned, and I am representing senior people in the administration who are just asking for basic answers as to why EOP Security is still sitting on their background investigation a year after it has been completed.\"\n\nSecurity clearance problems grabbed headlines in early February when Rob Porter was forced to resign as White House staff secretary after his two ex-wives went public with accusations of spousal abuse. Mr. Kelly and other White House officials initially defended Mr. Porter's character. However, public outrage, fueled in part by a photograph of ex-wife Colbie Holderness with a black eye, quickly forced the White House to oust Mr. Porter.\n\nMr. Kelly acknowledged that the White House mishandled the episode. But he said he wasn't told of \"red flags\" on Mr. Porter's security clearance until the Daily Mail reported the story on Feb. 6. The nearly yearlong delay occurred in the personnel security office.\n\nMr. Porter was one of as many as 40 officials at the White House working with interim security clearance after more than a year because the process was mired. When the FBI background check reveals negative information about a White House official, the personnel security office usually would inform the chief of staff and White House counsel about the \"suitability\" concern. A White House aide with a \"suitability\" problem would usually resign.\n\nThe FBI delivered the background check to the personnel security office in March 2017. Security clearance professionals have questioned why the information was not transmitted to Mr. Kelly or White House counsel Donald McGahn. \"The question mark is whether that was communicated to anybody else in the administration,\" said Mr. Bigley. \"Based on my experience dealing with EOP Security, I think they probably did just sit on this and drop the ball.\"\n\nMr. Kelly targeted the communication breakdown in a memo outlining an overhaul of the security clearance process in the wake of the Porter debacle. He ordered the FBI to hand-deliver background investigation files to the White House counsel, bypassing the personnel security office.\n\n\"The FBI official who delivers these files should verbally brief the White House Counsel on any information in those files they deem to be significantly derogatory. The White House Counsel will then deliver the [background investigation] to the Personnel Security Office for adjudication,\" Mr. Kelly wrote in the Feb. 16 memo.\n\nThe overhaul of the security clearance system, including reining in the number of interim clearances, prompted Mr. Kelly to order the downgrade of Mr. Kushner's top-secret clearance. Mr. Kushner still has clearance for access to government secrets although not at the highest level, which would include the president's daily briefings by intelligence agencies.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions and Media Tensions: A Return to the Norm\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by political maneuvering and media tensions, President Donald Trump's actions continue to stir controversy. The President's tweet, featuring a video of himself body-slamming someone with a CNN logo superimposed on his face, has sparked a response from CNN, with the network stating, \"It's a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters... We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly working on changes to the GOP health care bill, rather than repealing Obamacare first as suggested by the President. Trump is set to return to Washington D.C. tonight, where he and First Lady Melania Trump will host a picnic for military families at the White House and view fireworks on the Fourth of July.\n\nThe ongoing feud between the President and the media is a complex issue. Trump's tweets, like much of his conduct, are often impulsive outbursts driven by short-term tactical decisions. However, this is where he turns when he can't find another groove. While it's not necessary to pass judgment on the sentiments he's sharing or the actions he's seemingly condoning, it's clear that there's a segment of his base that wants to see him in a professional wrestling match.\n\nIn other news, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's spokesperson commented on Christie's family spending Sunday on a closed beach after ordering a government shutdown, stating, \"He did not get any sun. He had a baseball hat on.\"\n\nPresident Trump's Homeland Security Adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the President's CNN tweet, stating, \"No one would perceive that as a threat.\" Bossert also praised Trump as the \"most genuine president... we've seen in [ his ] lifetime.\"\n\nRepublican Governor John Kasich of Ohio has criticized the current version of the Senate Republican health care bill, stating it's \"not an acceptable choice\" and makes it harder for states to treat opioid addicts.\n\nAt least 17 states are balking at the Trump administration's request for voter registration data as part of the new election integrity commission, with six states outright declining to provide the information.\n\nThe Note is a daily feature that highlights the key political moments of the day ahead.

    " Title: US Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation into Michael Cohen, Trump's Former Lawyer\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Justice Department has announced that Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, is under criminal investigation. The focus of the investigation is reportedly Cohen's business dealings rather than his work as a lawyer.\n\nAccording to a court filing, Cohen has been under investigation for months. The filing was in response to efforts by Cohen's own lawyer to prevent prosecutors from reviewing material seized from Cohen's office during a raid on Monday. Cohen's team argues that the papers are covered by the attorney-client privilege.\n\nPresident Trump has condemned the office raid, calling it \"disgraceful\" and \"an attack on our country.\" During a court hearing in New York on Friday, prosecutor Tom McKay accused Cohen of trying to use attorney-client privilege \"as a sword to challenge the government's ability to review evidence.\"\n\nGovernment prosecutors also said they believed Cohen had \"a low volume of potentially privileged communication\" because he seems to only have one client - President Trump. The filing stated, \"It is neither apparent that Cohen, in his capacity as an attorney, has many, or any, attorney-client relationships other than with President Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe filing added that while Cohen was an attorney, \"he also has several other business interests and sources of income,\" and is \"being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centres on his personal business dealings.\"\n\nIn a separate development, Cohen reportedly negotiated a $1.6 million settlement with a former Playboy model on behalf of a Republican fundraiser, according to a Wall Street Journal article. Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles investor, acknowledged \"a consensual relationship\" with the Playmate, who became pregnant.\n\nMr. Broidy said it was \"unfortunate\" that the personal matter was \"the subject of national discussion\" because of the involvement of Cohen. Mr. Broidy was previously in the news after he urged President Trump to sack then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over a diplomatic dispute.\n\nCohen has admitted to having paid a porn actress, Stormy Daniels, $130,000 before the 2016 US presidential election. Ms. Daniels claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump, and he and his lawyers made attempts to buy her silence.\n\nA new lawyer for President Trump, Joanna Hendon, said the president had an \"acute interest\" in the case. Ms. Hendon, who was hired on Wednesday, asked the judge to adjourn the session so she had more time to prepare. According to a New York Times report, the president phoned Cohen to \"check in\" on him today. Lawyers tend to advise clients not to discuss investigations, which means their discussion could cause them problems, depending on what they talked about.",
    " Title: \"The New York Times' 2016: A Year of Corrections, Inaccuracies, and Misrepresentations\"\n\nArticle:\n\n-The New York Times, one of the world's most respected newspapers, has had a tumultuous year in terms of accuracy and credibility. In light of the recent revelation that the outlet had \"obtained\" an unpublished government draft of a climate change report, which turned out to be available online since January, we take a look at some of the biggest errors, inaccuracies, blunders, misrepresentations, and general failures from The New York Times so far in 2016.\n\n1 ) Correction on Claim that 17 Intelligence Agencies \"Agree\" on Russia:\nIn a June report, The New York Times regurgitated the baseless claim that 17 U.S. intelligence agencies agreed Russia was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election. The report in question was published roughly one month after \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation fact check team had thoroughly debunked the claim. ( RELATED : The Media Perpetuated A Clinton Lie For 9 Months )\nThe New York Times and other media outlets parroted the claim after Hillary Clinton used it in a presidential debate. Almost a year later, after the claim was debunked in multiple high profile settings, The New York Times issued a correction noting that only four intelligence agencies came to a consensus on Russian meddling.\n\n2 ) Parody Twitter Account Mistaken for Official Account of the North Korean Government:\nNew York Times reporters incorrectly attributed a tweet mocking American military efforts to the North Korean government, when the tweet was actually the product of an account dedicated to parodying North Korean news.\nThe DPRK News Service claims to be the \u201c official News feed of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, \u201d but the account is run by two Americans \u2014 Patrick and Derrick, according to The Washington Post.\nThe New York Times later issued a correction acknowledging they fell for the parody.\n\n3 ) Story on Food Stamps and Soda Flubbed \u2014 Twice:\nThe New York Times misreported data from a government study on what people buy on food stamps, then updated the story with an additional error without issuing a correction. The central claim of the January story, headlined, \u201c In the Shopping Cart of a Food Stamp Household: Lots of Soda, \u201d was that the Department of Agriculture has a report showing food stamps recipients spend nearly 10 cents of every dollar on soft drinks. But that number is almost double what the report actually said.\nThe New York Times later updated the story, without issuing an note of correction, after a University of Arkansas professor pointed out the error on Twitter. The updated version, however, still incorrectly stated that soft drinks are not included in the \u201c sweetened beverages \u201d category. \u201c SNAP households spent 9.3 percent of their grocery budgets on sweetened beverages alone, not including soft drinks, \u201d the article said. This is incorrect, as soft drinks are indeed included in the \u201c sweetened beverage \u201d category in the USDA\u2019 s full report.\n\n4 ) NYT Reporter Forced to Correct Statement on Attorney General Jeff Sessions:\nNew York Times editor Jonathan Weisman was forced to retract a June tweet insinuating Sessions was corrupt.\nWeisman asserted former FBI Director James Comey testified that Sessions asked him directly to call the Russia probe \u201c a matter. \u201d But Comey had actually testified that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2014 not Sessions \u2014 had approached him with that request.\nWeisman\u2019 s tweet no longer appears on his Twitter page, but he sent another tweet shortly after noon in which he reported the news that the request came from Lynch.\n\n5 ) Correction to Editorial Attacking Sarah Palin with Debunked Conspiracy Theory:\nAfter a man shot up a GOP congressional baseball practice in May, The New York Times used a debunked conspiracy theory to attack former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in an editorial. The paper baselessly linked her campaign messaging to the shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011.\n\u201c In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear, \u201d the editorial board wrote. \u201c Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019 s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. \u201d\nNot only is the correction baseless, but the description of the map was inaccurate as well. The map in question depicted Democratic districts in crosshairs \u2014 not Democratic candidates.\nAfter substantial public backlash, The New York Times heavily edited the piece and added a correction: \u201c An editorial on Thursday about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs. \u201d",
    " Title: Understanding Political Polarization: A Call for Empathy and Bipartisanship in the Aftermath of Narrow Electoral Victories\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, it is crucial to reflect on the significance of narrow political victories and the impact they can have on policy-making. The 77,744 votes by which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have led to a significantly more conservative political landscape, with consequences that extend far beyond the initial vote count.\n\nOne example of the far-reaching effects of a narrow victory can be seen in the 2008 U.S. Senate race in Minnesota, where Al Franken's 302-vote victory ensured the 60th vote needed to push through Obamacare in 2010. Another instance is the infamous 2000 presidential race in Florida, where the outcome was decided by a mere 537 votes.\n\nThe political system in the United States has a history of producing significant policy changes based on small vote margins, a trend that has been exacerbated by increasing partisan polarization over the past few decades. This polarization has resulted in a two-party system that incentivizes each party to aim for more than 50% of the vote, which helps bind together a diverse nation but also emphasizes our differences.\n\nIn recent history, neither party has managed to secure 50% of the vote in 15 of the 41 Democratic-Republican presidential contests since 1856, with one 50% candidate, Samuel Tilden in 1876, losing by one electoral vote. Thomas Dewey's Hollywood celebrity supporters did not run ads begging electors to vote against Harry Truman, and Democrats have been especially unhappy this year, as they had good reason to think they would win.\n\nAs we move forward during the holiday season, it is essential to find ways to bridge the gap between political ideologies and promote understanding. One suggestion is to empathize with those who hold opposing views. By understanding the values and motivations of those who support the candidate we oppose, we can foster a more informed and compassionate political discourse.\n\nAnother suggestion is for pundits and commentators to move away from team-oriented analysis and toward more nuanced, independent perspectives. With the alignment between liberal commentators and elected Democrats and conservative commentators and elected Republicans becoming less likely in the near future, it is crucial to encourage a diversity of opinions and perspectives in political discourse.\n\nLastly, it is essential to avoid getting caught up in process arguments, such as the recent debate over the Electoral College. Process arguments are often insincere and serve only to further divide the political landscape. By focusing on the substance of the issues at hand, we can promote a more productive and empathetic political discourse.\n\nIn conclusion, narrow political victories can lead to significant changes, and it is our responsibility to do a better job of understanding one another. By empathizing with those who hold opposing views, promoting independent perspectives, and avoiding process arguments, we can foster a more informed, compassionate, and productive political discourse.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree on Denuclearization of Korean Peninsula, Tone Down Rhetoric Amid Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, following a phone conversation on Friday. The White House and Chinese state television confirmed the discussion on Saturday.\n\nDuring the conversation, Xi urged both the U.S. and North Korea to tone down their recent rhetoric and avoid actions that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Xi was quoted as saying, \"At present, the relevant parties must maintain restraint and avoid words and deeds that would exacerbate the tension on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nThe White House statement affirmed that Trump and Xi acknowledged the recent adoption of a new United Nations Security Council resolution regarding North Korea as an important step towards achieving peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The leaders agreed that North Korea must cease its provocative and escalatory behavior.\n\nThe statement also highlighted the mutual commitment of both leaders to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The White House statement added that Trump is looking forward to meeting with Xi in China later this year, a trip that was confirmed by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Manila.\n\nTrump has been urging China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program, which North Korea claims is nearing the capability of targeting the United States. China, being North Korea's biggest economic partner and source of aid, has stated that it alone cannot compel Pyongyang to end its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to protect his nation's people as tensions rise over North Korea's plans to send missiles over Japan towards Guam. Abe made these comments while visiting his father's tomb in his ancestral hometown of Nagato, in western Japan.\n\nIn response to the potential risk of missile fragments, Japan's Defense Ministry has deployed four surface-to-air Patriot interceptors in western Japan. However, it remains unclear whether a direct order to shoot down incoming missiles has been issued by the newly appointed Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera.\n\nTrump, in a fresh threat on Friday, warned that the U.S. military is \"locked and loaded\" and that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would \"regret it fast\" if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies.",
    " Title: US Job Market Shows Robust Growth in January, Wages Increase at Fastest Pace in Nearly a Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a positive development for the US economy and American workers, the January jobs report has shown a robust growth across various sectors. According to the Associated Press, employers added 200,000 jobs in January, marking the fastest wage growth in eight years.\n\nThe Labor Department reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls jumped by 200,000 jobs last month, following a rise of 160,000 in December. The unemployment rate remained steady at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3 percent in January to $26.74, building on December's solid 0.4 percent gain. This boosted the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest rise since June 2009.\n\nThe strong employment report indicates a healthy labor market momentum. Economists attribute job gains to buoyant domestic and global demand. However, the report suggests that the US economy is approaching full employment, with companies reporting difficulties in finding qualified workers. This could potentially force some companies to significantly raise wages as they compete for scarce labor.\n\nWage growth in January was likely supported by increases in the minimum wage that came into effect in 18 states, as well as the tax cut. Companies like Starbucks Corp and FedEx Corp have announced plans to use some of their tax savings to boost wages for workers. Walmart is also expected to raise entry-level wages for hourly employees at its U.S. stores in February.\n\nWhile the job growth is expected to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment, the robust employment report underscores the strong momentum in the economy. The Atlanta Fed's projection for 2018's Q1 economic growth number surpassing five percent has been shared by many conservatives, but it is important to note that the New York Fed's estimate for Q4 of 2017 fell well short of the actual number.\n\nIn conclusion, the US job market is showing signs of robust growth, with wages increasing at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The economy's fundamentals are unquestionably healthy, and Americans are feeling optimistic. However, it remains to be seen how strong the economy will be in the long term.",
    " Title: CIA Director Warns of Potential Increase in ISIL-Inspired Terror Attacks, Political Divide on Gun Control Emerge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sobering address to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, CIA Director John Brennan issued a warning about the Islamic State's (ISIL) potential for conducting further Orlando-style terrorist attacks in the near future. Brennan stated that ISIL is actively training and deploying operatives for such attacks, and has a large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially carry out attacks in the West.\n\nBrennan outlined various means by which ISIL is exploring infiltration, including joining the flow of refugees into Western countries, using smuggling routes, and commercial travel. The threat of ISIL-inspired attacks has sparked a political divide between Democrats and Republicans on how to prevent future attacks in the United States.\n\nDemocrats are advocating for tougher gun laws, while Republicans are calling for the president to take tougher action against ISIS and Islamic extremists. President Barack Obama's critics argue that his open border approach to immigration and foreign policy decisions are to blame for terrorist attacks like the Orlando massacre.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., went as far as to say the president was \"directly responsible\" for the mass shooting because he withdrew all U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, which led to the rise of ISIS. McCain later retracted the statement, saying the president's policies led to the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is set to vote on new gun control legislation on Monday. Democrats are advocating for a policy called \"no fly, no buy,\" which would ban anyone on a terror watch list from purchasing a weapon. Under current law, the FBI is already notified when terror suspects try to buy weapons. House Republicans say they do not plan to consider new gun legislation.\n\n\"Is going after the second amendment how you stop terrorism? No!\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan. During a rally in Dallas on Thursday, Donald Trump criticized the president, vowing to protect American gun rights.\n\n\"To a large extent he's blaming guns and I'm going to save your Second Amendment folks. I'm going to save your Second Amendment,\" Trump promised. Earlier in the week, Trump suggested that more people at the Orlando nightclub with guns would have prevented the tragedy. However, during his visit to Orlando on Thursday, Obama scoffed at that suggestion.\n\n\"The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to assure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense,\" said the president.\n\nIn a poignant gesture, a Christian from Illinois drove 1,200 miles to place 49 crosses at the site, each cross bearing the name of a victim. Greg Zanis explained, \"My message today is love your brother, love your neighbor. Don't judge them... I'm just offering hope in a very hopeless situation.\"",
    " Title: FBI Foils Terror Plot in Brooklyn: Three Uzbek Men Arrested for Alleged ISIS-Inspired Terror Activities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant counter-terrorism operation, the FBI conducted raids in Brooklyn, New York, on Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of three men from Uzbekistan who were reportedly planning to travel to Syria to join ISIS and potentially carry out acts of domestic terrorism in the United States.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the youngest of the suspects, Akhror Saidakhmetov, allegedly expressed a desire to buy a machine gun and attack police officers and FBI agents if his plan to join ISIS was thwarted. Another suspect, Abdurasul Hasanofvich Juraboev, reportedly posted online in August 2014 that he would kill President Obama if ISIS requested him to do so.\n\nThe plot is described as \"aspirational, not operational,\" but the early stages of the plan seemed to be progressing, with Saidakhmetov being arrested at JFK Airport while attempting to board a flight to Istanbul. Juraboev's travel plans would have taken him to Turkey a month later. The third suspect, Abror Habibov, allegedly operated a domestic support network for the trio.\n\nThe individuals were reportedly inspired by ISIS's social media outreach program, which included calls for \"lone wolf\" jihadis to launch attacks in America and Europe. Fox News reports that two of the men came to the attention of law enforcement last summer due to their online support for the group. They have been charged with conspiracy to provide material support to the Islamic State and could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe UK Daily Mail provides further details of Saidakhmetov's violent intentions, as revealed to a criminal informant. If he could not enter Syria, Saidakhmetov reportedly planned to \"just go buy a machine gun, AK-47, and shoot all police.\" He had a four-stage plan in mind: obtaining a handgun, shooting a police officer, taking the officer's gun, bullets, and bulletproof vest, and then attacking the FBI headquarters.\n\nThe New York Daily News also reports a quote from a post allegedly left by Juraboev on an ISIS-aligned website: \"We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present [in Syria]. I am in USA now but we don't have any arms. Is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the heart of infidels.\"\n\nThe suspects do not appear to be sophisticated terror operatives, but the \"lone wolf\" jihad does not require intricate strategy or refined tradecraft. The New York Daily News concludes its report with a reminder that NYPD counter-terrorism chief John Miller warned in June that there were over 100 would-be jihadis lurking in New York City.",
    " Title: Romney's Vice Presidential Pick: Condoleezza Rice - A Game Changer for the 2012 Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe speculation surrounding Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick is gaining momentum as the Republican National Convention approaches next month. The former Bush administration Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, has emerged as a strong contender for the position, according to recent reports.\n\nRomney's wife, Ann, has hinted that a woman could be on the ticket, and Rice received a warm reception at Romney's donor retreat in Utah and a standing ovation at a GOP women's fundraiser in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe selection of Rice would be a significant move for the 2012 race, as she would be the first African-American woman to be on a major party's presidential ticket. This comes at a time when the GOP is struggling to connect with minority, female voters, and single women.\n\nRice's political experience and foreign policy expertise would compensate for Romney's lack of international experience, as he has primarily dealt with domestic policy during his tenure as a governor and a businessman. However, the selection of Rice could face opposition from both the left and the right.\n\nOpposition from the left will likely center on Rice's role in the Bush administration, particularly her role in the Iraq war and the weapons of mass destruction controversy. The right, on the other hand, may express concerns about her stance on abortion and her past role in the Bush administration.\n\nOne of the advantages of selecting Rice is her strong political stance on issues such as immigration and education reform. She has been vocal in her opposition to anti-immigrant fervor from the GOP right wing and has taken a politically daring position by standing up for immigrants. This stance will be beneficial as the Romney campaign tries to win over Latino voters.\n\nRice has also partnered with Joel Klein, the former chancellor of the New York City public school system, to draw attention to the crisis in American public education. They co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations panel that examined the failure of public education as a threat to America's national security.\n\nThe report found that 75 percent of American young adults do not qualify to serve in the military due to criminal records, physical unfitness, or inadequate levels of education. This includes about half of the nation's black and Hispanic students, who drop out of high school.\n\nIn his election night speech in New Hampshire last week, Romney expressed a desire to \"stop the unfairness of urban children being denied access to the good schools of their choice.\" Rice's message on education reform could help jumpstart the debate and potentially reform Romney's image while giving the education reform movement a boost.\n\nIn conclusion, the selection of Condoleezza Rice as Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick could be a game-changer for the 2012 race. Her political experience, foreign policy expertise, and strong stance on issues such as immigration and education reform could help Romney connect with minority, female voters, and single women, while also addressing the education crisis that poses a significant threat to America's national security.",
    " Title: Wood Mackenzie Predicts Solar Energy as the Next Major Breakthrough in U.S. Energy Supply\n\nArticle:\n\nThe declining oil prices may be slowing the U.S. shale boom, but the nation is set to remain a leading global producer of oil and natural gas well into the future, thanks to advances in drilling technology. As the U.S. energy sector looks to the future, a new study by Scotland-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie suggests that solar energy could be the next major breakthrough.\n\nIn a study titled \"Is Solar the Next Shale?\", Wood Mackenzie argues that steep reductions in the costs of making solar modules put that technology in a strong position to compete with other forms of electric power in many parts of the U.S. In fact, the economics for large-scale solar installations have already reached parity with those for gas combined-cycle and combustion plants in California and other parts of the U.S., according to Wood Mackenzie analysts. By 2020, they expect that parity will exist in 19 states, increasing to 38 by 2030.\n\n\"Just as shale extraction reconfigured oil and gas, no other technology is closer to transforming power markets than distributed and utility-scale solar,\" the study says. Solar energy will continue to be a small part of total U.S. electric generating capacity, with Wood Mackenzie estimating that solar will account for 6% of the nation's generating mix in 2035, compared to just 1% now. However, a relatively small amount of solar capacity can go a long way toward disrupting electric power markets.\n\nFor example, solar power, obviously, contributes the most during the day, when the sun is shining, and demand for electricity is often at its peak. That's also when fossil-fuel power plants, including natural gas units, whose market share has been growing with the shale boom, make most of their money. Moreover, the trend is set to go on, Wood Mackenzie says, as the cost of solar continues to come down while the cost of combined-cycle gas plants, the preferred option for utilities, rises.\n\n\"We certainly see an upside to solar, a significant upside. And you really don't need that much solar to hurt the economics of fossil-fuel plants,\" explains Prajit Ghosh, a research director with Wood Mackenzie. \"Even a small amount of solar can have a pretty significant impact on the value of gas and coal plants and reliability.\"\n\nThe growing challenge for the electric power industry and its regulators is to integrate solar into the grid without forcing gas-fired power plants offline and disrupting the reliability of utility systems. California is already grappling with the issue, and other regions with significant solar potential, like Arizona, New Jersey, and Texas, will increasingly do so, Ghosh says.\n\nDespite the challenges, Ghosh does not see any major setback for solar if a federal investment tax credit expires on Dec. 31, 2016, as scheduled. The subsidy provides a 30% credit for solar systems on residential and commercial properties. The Obama administration, in its recent budget proposal, calls for extending the tax break to support continued growth in solar energy, and the industry strongly supports the idea. However, Ghosh says the incentive is no longer necessary.\n\n\"The level of cost savings we expect [in solar] will more than compensate for any reduction in tax credit support,\" he says.

    " Title: Newly Released Senate Transcripts Shed Light on Trump Tower Meeting, Donald Trump Jr. and Others Downplay Significance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Senate Judiciary Committee has released over 1,800 pages of transcripts from interviews with numerous figures involved in the controversial June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. The meeting, which initially fueled allegations of Trump campaign coordination with Russia, has been downplayed in significance by key figures, including Donald Trump Jr., who said Hillary Clinton was hardly discussed.\n\nThe transcripts reveal that Donald Trump Jr. was \"skeptical\" going into the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. In an email to him, Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting at the request of pop singer Emin Agalarov, suggested that someone had official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton and her dealings with Russia. However, Trump Jr. noted his skepticism as he only knew Goldstone as a \"colorful music promoter.\"\n\nRob Goldstone, in his testimony, admitted that he thought the meeting was a \"bad idea.\" Trump Jr. stated that the meeting provided no meaningful information and was primarily focused on Russian adoptions, as he had stated over a year later in his July 8, 2017, statement.\n\nVeselnitskaya, in her written response, stated that no information specific to Clinton was provided in the meeting. She also lamented the \"kind of apocalyptic Hollywood scenario\" that a private conversation between a lawyer and a businessman can be turned into.\n\nTrump Jr. testified that he had \"no way to gauge\" the \"reliability, credibility, or accuracy\" of anything Goldstone promised. He also stated that if he was given information on Clinton, he would have then consulted with counsel to \"make an informed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration.\"\n\nThe meeting is under scrutiny in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The testimony of Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson was also made public Wednesday, for a second time. Simpson's firm was behind the composition of the Trump dossier, filled with salacious and unverified allegations against the president regarding matters related to Russia.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement, \"These materials, taken in their entirety, provide the most complete public picture of the events surrounding the meeting to date. Americans can now review this unfiltered information and arrive at their own conclusions.\"",

The memos, which were sent to Congress and subsequently leaked to the press, include accounts of their first meeting, phone calls, and discussions about the investigation into Russian collusion and interference in the 2016 election.\n\nOne of the memos, dated February 14, 2017, reveals that President Trump expressed \"serious reservations\" about the \"judgment\" of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with a Russian ambassador.\n\nIn another memo, dated January 28, 2017, Comey claims he reassured Trump during a dinner that the FBI would be fair in its investigation. Comey wrote, \"I don't do sneaky things, I don't leak, I don't do weasel moves.\" Comey added that Trump replied, \"I need loyalty, and I expect loyalty.\"\n\nA phone conversation between Comey and Trump on March 30, 2017, is also detailed in the memos. During this conversation, Trump reportedly urged Comey to tell the public that he was not under investigation.\n\nThe release of these memos comes as a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The memos provide a unique insight into the relationship between the former FBI director and the president.\n\nFor more detailed coverage, watch Fox News' Ed Henry's report on the Comey memos.",
    " Title: Florida Surpasses 300,000 Confirmed COVID-19 Cases, Governor DeSantis Addresses Testing Delays and Hospital Capacity\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida has surpassed the grim milestone of 300,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state now ranks second in the nation in terms of the number of cases reported, trailing only California and New York.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state reported an additional 10,181 new confirmed cases, marking a significant surge in infections in recent weeks. Florida took more than three months to reach 100,000 cases but then took just two weeks to jump from 100,000 to 200,000.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis addressed the ongoing testing delays during a news conference on Wednesday. The state is currently conducting approximately 90,000 tests per day, but DeSantis expressed concern over the lengthy processing times. \"One thing that I think is clear is that we need to get these testing results back in a timely fashion,\" DeSantis said.\n\nIn an effort to expedite test results, the state will be shifting business away from commercial labs that have not been able to return test results within the agreed-upon 48-hour turnaround time, as testing was expanded in early May. Contact tracers have also reported that delays in testing results are making their jobs more challenging.\n\nFlorida also reported an additional 112 deaths on Wednesday. This is the third time in the past seven days that the state has reported more than 100 deaths, according to CBS Miami. As of Wednesday, more than 4,500 people have died in Florida due to COVID-19.\n\nFlorida's emergency management director, Jared Moskowitz, compared the state's response to a hurricane, but noted that the response is complicated by politics. \"When a Category 5 hits, nobody argues whether it was whether it was a Category 5, and in this disaster, we are arguing over everything,\" Moskowitz said.\n\nGovernor DeSantis announced that additional medical personnel have been sent to Miami-Dade County, which is currently facing some of the highest infection rates in the state. Although the county's ICU beds are at capacity, the governor said the hospitals in the county still have plenty of other space that can be utilized for coronavirus patients. However, the governor added that the real issue is a lack of healthcare workers.\n\nTo address the testing delays, the governor also announced that the state will be introducing lanes at testing sites specifically for those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Individuals who use these lanes will self-administer the swabs, and their test results will be expedited, according to DeSantis.",

I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\"\n\nWarren responded on Twitter, stating, \"What would really'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"\n\nIn March, Warren outlined a plan to break up several tech giants, including Facebook, arguing that they have \"stifled innovation.\" If elected, Warren stated she would appoint regulators who would \"unwind anti-competitive mergers\" like Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates, such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, have also expressed support for breaking up the tech giants.\n\nZuckerberg told employees that breaking up the companies would not solve the issues at hand and could potentially increase the likelihood of election interference and hate speech. He argued that the company's resources for detecting such activities would be diminished if Facebook were broken up.\n\nThe Facebook staff meetings took place amidst an escalating national discussion over the power and dominance of the giant tech companies and increased antitrust scrutiny from regulators. The meetings also occurred in the same month that Facebook reached a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy failures related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Critics argued that the deal was essentially a slap on the wrist for a company that generates $16 billion of revenue alone in a three-month period.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allied Troops Withdraw from Iraq Amidst Escalating Tensions with Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington has ordered the departure of non-emergency American employees from its diplomatic missions in Iraq, as a response to perceived threats from Iran. The Trump administration is imposing new sanctions on Tehran and deploying additional forces to the Middle East to counter what it deems as an increased threat to U.S. soldiers and interests in the region.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced that employees at both the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, were being withdrawn immediately due to safety concerns. The number of personnel affected and any specific threat details remain unclear. Visa services were also suspended at the heavily fortified U.S. missions.\n\nA State Department spokesman stated, \"Ensuring the safety of U.S. government personnel and citizens is our highest priority... and we want to reduce the risk of harm.\"\n\nGermany, which has 160 soldiers in Iraq, suspended military training operations, citing increasing regional tensions. The Netherlands also suspended a mission providing assistance to Iraqi local authorities, according to Dutch news agency ANP.\n\nIran has labeled these actions as \"psychological warfare,\" while a British commander expressed skepticism regarding U.S. military concerns about threats to its roughly 5,000 soldiers in Iraq, who have been aiding local security forces in fighting Islamic State jihadists.\n\nBoth the United States and Iran have stated they do not wish for war, and Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday that he had indications \"things will end well\" despite the rhetoric. Iraq has maintained strong ties with Iran, while also maintaining relationships with the United States and regional neighbors, some of whom, like Saudi Arabia, view Tehran as an arch-rival.\n\nU.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN in an interview on Wednesday, \"I think we are now in a quite dangerous situation where a miscalculation by either side could lead us into conflict.\" Coons added, \"When you project force into a very volatile region and you've got real tension between Iran and the Saudis -- we have to be careful. We need a strategy.\"\n\nThe State Department reissued a travel advisory for Iraq, warning U.S. citizens of a high risk of violence and kidnapping. \"Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq,\" it said. A senior Iranian official stated on Wednesday that any conflict in the region will have \"unimaginable consequences.\"",
    " Title: \"A Divided Legacy: The Controversy Surrounding Confederate Military Base Names and the Views of Their Descendants\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate about the names of military bases that honor Confederate military leaders, a diverse group of relatives have found themselves at the center of a nationwide argument that has personal implications for them, despite having no special influence over the matter. A recent poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult shows that a significant majority of the general public believes these bases should be left as they are, or are unsure about what to do with them.\n\nIn an effort to shed light on the perspectives of these relatives, \u2588\u2588\u2588 tracked down 16 relatives of eight Confederate military leaders whose names are memorialized on military bases or other prominent facilities. The group, politically and geographically diverse, hails from North, South, East, and West, and includes teachers, scientists, journalists, military veterans, financial advisers, a retired yoga and surfing instructor, and more.\n\nThe relatives' views, while not unanimous, are surprisingly consistent. Most passionately believe their ancestors' names should be removed from all military monuments, buildings, streets, ships, planes, or paraphernalia, as stipulated in one of the Senate bills. A minority of them are equally fervent that their ancestors deserve to be honored. Some family members who hold these opposing views are in the same family.\n\nThe issue has caused rifts within some families. For example, some of the kin of the notorious Nathan Bedford Forrest, who has a street named in his honor at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, are not on speaking terms over the issue. Most descendants of Leonidas Polk want the base named for him changed, but not all. The descendants of General A.P. Hill insist that renaming the base bearing his name would be an unjust humiliation. The relatives of General John Bell Hood are torn about how to strike the proper balance between righting the wrongs of history and still acknowledging their ancestor's honorable postwar accomplishments.\n\nThe Army bases in question are Fort Rucker in Alabama, Forts Benning and Gordon in Georgia, Fort Polk and Camp Beauregard in Louisiana, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, and Forts A.P. Hill, Pickett, and Lee in Virginia. These bases were established long after the Civil War, mainly during two key military buildups to wage World War I and World War II.\n\nAt the time, when the military was still segregated into Black and white units, many elected leaders from the South, including powerful members of Congress, were avowed racists. They also sought to recast the Civil War as not about slavery but a defense of states' rights.\n\nOnly recently has the Army said there is reason to reconsider the names. As recently as 2015, following a deadly mass shooting in a Black church in South Carolina by a white supremacist, Major General Malcolm Frost, then the Army's chief spokesman, explained that \"every Army installation is named for a soldier who holds a place in our military history.\" He stressed that the names \"represent individuals, not causes or ideologies,\" and the decision to name bases for Confederates was \"in the spirit of reconciliation, not division.\"\n\nHowever, for many in the bloodline of these rebel officers, there is no doubt about what needs to be done today. \"I think white people should follow the lead of Black activists and people of color more broadly fighting for equality and rights, and support this struggle in any way we can,\" said Mimi Kirk, the great-great-great granddaughter of General John Brown Gordon, who wants Georgia's Fort Gordon renamed so it is not honoring a leading white supremacist.\n\nFor others, such a move would be an affront. \"No. Absolutely not,\" said Tim Hill, 53, when asked if the post in Virginia named for his direct ancestor, A.P. Hill, should be changed. \"At the time, he fought for what he believed in. From what I've read, the fight for him wasn't about slavery, it was just about, he referred to [it] as 'Northern aggression.'\"\n\nOthers say they are still struggling with how their ancestor's legacy should be remembered. Hood's cousin, Stephen M. \"Sam\" Hood, who has published two books about the general, maintains it is \"instructive to look at the individuals who are honored, not the causes for which they served for a brief period of their lives or careers.\"\n\nBut most of the descendants who have shared their views say it is past time to honor only Americans whom everyone can agree are deserving. \"We have a lot of people in American history that we should be valuing that we're not, and I think now is the time to reassess those things and have other people\u2014Native Americans, women, and African Americans\u2014be looked at for role models, not just people who were generals,\" says Milbry Polk, 66, whose forebear Gen. Leonidas Polk is honored with Fort Polk in Louisiana.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Directs DOJ to Monitor State and Local Shutdown Orders Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at balancing public health and constitutional rights, Attorney General Bill Barr has instructed federal prosecutors to monitor state and local shutdown orders for potential overreach during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The memo, issued on Monday, emphasizes the need to combat the virus while respecting people's constitutional rights.\n\nThe memo recognizes that while some restrictions are necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19, overly restrictive measures could infringe on these rights. \"If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court,\" Barr stated.\n\nThe Justice Department has previously intervened in a Mississippi lawsuit, siding with a church after local officials tried to prevent Holy Week services in a parking lot. As some states begin to ease restrictions, others remain vigilant, leading to protests in certain areas due to the skyrocketing unemployment rate.\n\nIn a recent interview, Barr criticized some state orders as \"disturbingly close to house arrest.\" He suggested that while the initial goal was to flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases, states should now adopt \"more targeted approaches.\"\n\nThe attorney general has assigned the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan to coordinate the department's efforts to monitor state and local policies and take action if necessary.\n\n\"Many policies that would be unthinkable in regular times have become commonplace in recent weeks, and we do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,\" the memo stated. \"But the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.\"\n\nPresident Trump, when asked about Barr's directive during a Monday press briefing, said, \"Well, you'd have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I think he wants to see\u2014like everybody\u2014he wants to see people get back and he wants to see people get back to work. He doesn't want people to be held up when there's no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps it's too strict. He wants to make sure people have the rights and they maintain the rights, very importantly.\"",
    " Title: Trump Questions Obama's Commitment to Fighting Radical Islamic Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews on Monday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expressed doubts about President Barack Obama's commitment to fighting radical Islamic terrorism. During a phone interview on \"Fox and Friends,\" Trump stated, \"We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind.\"\n\nTrump went on to say, \"And the something else in mind, you know, people can't believe it, people can't believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on \u2014 it's inconceivable. There's something going on.\"\n\nTrump's comments come amidst ongoing concerns about the handling of terrorism by the Obama administration, particularly in light of the recent shooting in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed and dozens more injured. Trump's remarks on Monday were met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some accusing him of exploiting the tragedy for political gain.\n\nIn the past, Trump has raised questions about Obama's birthplace and suggested he is not a Christian. The White House responded to Trump's \"birther\" claims in 2011 by releasing the president's long-form birth certificate.\n\nOn NBC's \"Today\" show, Trump argued that Obama was intentionally pursuing ignorance on the topic of Islamism. Although Trump said he personally considers the president to be clueless, he gave consideration to conspiracy theories that the president has ulterior motives.\n\nTrump has repeatedly blasted Obama's handling of terrorism and in February accused the president of apologizing to Muslims after he visited a mosque to combat rhetoric against Muslim-Americans.\n\nSeveral journalists highlighted Trump's comments on Monday, a day after the Orlando shooting. Benjy Sarlin, a journalist for NBC News, tweeted, \"The president doesn't know [about radical Islamic terrorism] because he certainly doesn't do much about it in terms of intelligence, in terms of intelligence gathering.\"\n\nSam Stein, a journalist for The Huffington Post, tweeted, \"What Trump did this am is arguably equivalent to a Dem suggesting 9/11 is an inside job the day after 9/11.\"\n\nDuring his interview on the \"Today\" show, Trump said, \"I'm not sure that the president knows [about radical Islamic terrorism] if you want to know the truth. He won't even use the term 'radical Islamic terrorism.' I think he thinks that everyone's just a sweetheart.\"\n\nTrump's comments have sparked a heated debate about his approach to national security and his understanding of the threat posed by radical Islamic terrorism. As the presidential race heats up, Trump's comments are likely to be a major point of contention in the upcoming debates and campaign speeches.",

Chris Collins (R-NY) announced Saturday that he is suspending his re-election campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives, following his arrest on insider trading charges earlier in the week.\n\nCollins, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, stated in a press release that his decision to suspend his campaign was in the best interest of his constituents, the Republican Party, and the President's agenda.\n\nThe FBI arrested Collins on Wednesday, accusing him of selling stock in a pharmaceutical company he was a board member and the largest shareholder after learning that clinical testing on a key drug had failed. The FBI alleges that his family saved $760,000 through the stock sale.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the news, with some party members stating that the charges are further evidence of a culture of corruption that has permeated the Republican Party since President Trump took office. They argue that they would do better if given the opportunity to run the House.\n\nCollins has maintained the charges are baseless, and he vowed to clear his name. He also suggested that he did not want to become a distraction in the high-stakes election this fall, where control of Congress is at stake.\n\n\"Democrats are laser-focused on taking back the House, electing Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, and then launching impeachment proceedings against President Trump,\" Collins said in a statement. \"They would not do anything more than to elect an 'Impeach Trump' Democrat in this District, which is something that neither our country or my party can afford.\"\n\nCollins initially stated he planned to stay on the ballot after the news first broke, but it is unclear whether he will meet the criteria for removing his name from the ballot.

The host further accused CNN anchor Jim Sciutto of lying when he claimed in a 2018 tweet that the FBI would corroborate information in the Steele dossier before using it to justify the FISA warrant.\n\nAccording to Carlson, the DOJ IG report showed that the FBI instead hid information exposing the dossier as false and pretended it had been authenticated. The host also criticized NBC News intelligence correspondent Ken Dilanian for claiming in a 2018 tweet that Trump was wrong about Carter Page, the dossier, and the FISA warrant.\n\nCarlson concluded that CNN and other media outlets had misrepresented the DOJ IG report, and he called on journalists to do their homework and accurately report the facts.",
    " Title: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich Challenges President Obama's Immigration Policy as Unconstitutional Executive Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing opinion piece for CNN, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has criticized President Barack Obama's immigration policy, characterizing it as an unconstitutional executive action rather than a new government program. Gingrich, who also posted the piece on his Gingrich Productions website, accuses the president of creating a \"new law\" without Constitutional authority.\n\nIn his prime-time address on Thursday, President Obama outlined a plan that prioritized the deportation of felons, criminals, and gang members over other undocumented immigrants. However, Gingrich notes that the White House's real policy was revealed in a memo from its Office of Legislative Affairs hours before the address.\n\nThe memo outlines a 17-point plan that includes several new programs without Congressional approval, budget appropriation, or spending authorization. According to Gingrich, the plan establishes extensive new criteria for people to register for exemption from deportation, requires biometric data, background checks, fees, and tax payments, and demands proof of residency for at least five years.\n\nGingrich argues that the president's executive action, which directs the Department of Homeland Security to create a deferred action program to grant work permits for at least three years, is not just a pause on deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants. Instead, he describes it as a \"brand new program that hands out three-year work authorizations and processes more paperwork than many state DMVs.\"\n\nGingrich also takes issue with the president's claim that his executive action will offer relief to a narrow number of people. According to the policy memo, the DHS will direct all of its enforcement resources at pursuing national security threats, serious criminals, and recent border crossers, while offering work authorization to a group of 4 million undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria.\n\nGingrich accuses the president of relying on the \"stupidity of the American voter\" in his actions, a reference to Obamacare co-architect Jonathan Gruber's statements. He describes the address as a \"Gruber speech\" and a \"lie,\" and accuses the president of ignoring congressional mandates and exceeding his Constitutional authority.\n\nIn conclusion, Gingrich argues that President Obama's immigration policy is an unconstitutional executive action that is \"an order of magnitude larger\" than previous actions taken by presidents over the past half-century. He questions the president's assertion that his actions are lawful and compares them to the Obama model, which he describes as \"He said what he needed to say to do what he wants to do.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Christian Leaders Urge Trump to Recognize Jerusalem as Israel's Capital, but Embassy Move Delayed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, more than 60 influential U.S. Christian leaders have sent a letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. Embassy there. However, a White House official told Reuters that President Trump will not move the embassy at this time, as he feels it would complicate a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.\n\nThe U.S. has a long diplomatic history in the Holy Land, with the first U.S. consulate established in 1844 within the walls of the Old City. The building is now used by the Christian Information Center. In 1912, the consulate moved to a location on Prophet's Street, and later to a place where the U.S. representative to the Palestinian Authority now sits. A U.S. government building providing consular services for U.S. citizens is located a short drive away, while the embassy remains in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe question remains whether the embassy will ever move to Jerusalem. In 1995, David Parsons, media director of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ), helped draft the Jerusalem Embassy Act. \"We actually met with [Arizona] Senator John Kyl up on Capitol Hill one day and we gauged that he was serious\u2026that moving the embassy was an issue that he wanted to do on principle. It was not politics. It was principle, and he asked us to draft a bill,\" Parsons told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News.\n\nHowever, the bill was altered in Congress, and a presidential waiver authority was added, which allowed the president to suspend the bill if he certified it was in U.S. national security interests. \"It's fear that has kept us out,\" Parsons explained. \"It's been more than two decades since successive presidents have signed that waiver.\"\n\nThe current waiver expires in June. Some argue that moving the embassy could undermine the \"peace process\" and the ability to negotiate a deal. However, Parsons contends, \"I think at least putting our embassy in West Jerusalem would actually strengthen the peace process. It would give Israel confidence that its ally, America, is behind it. And I think that the longer the nations wait to do this, the bigger and bigger the question of Jerusalem becomes.\"\n\nIsraeli leaders, such as Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), share this view. \"Our claim, our presence in Jerusalem, has been here for decades\u2026Jews have been streaming back to their ancient capital for years. And the movement of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is an American recognition of the special ties of Jerusalem to the Jewish people. It may be symbolic, but it goes to the core of the identity of Israel,\" Gold told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News.\n\nRegardless of whether the U.S. Embassy moves to Jerusalem, Parsons sees a glorious future for the city. \"This is that promised Son of David, the Messiah, [who] will rule and reign over the world in peace and righteousness. We, as Christians, believe that's Jesus, but I think a house of prayer for all people, that exalted throne of the Messiah during the Messianic age. This is Israel's ultimate destiny and Jerusalem's,\" Parsons said.\n\nIn 1950, Israel declared Jerusalem as its capital, and in 1967, it captured the Old City and the eastern part of Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the Basic Law Jerusalem, incorporating all of the land captured in 1967 as its capital. This led most embassies to leave Jerusalem for Tel Aviv, and the ICEJ moved in.\n\n\"To represent Christians from all over the world who want to stand in solidarity with Israel, help secure it and help it reach its destiny and also want to stand in solidarity with their claim and connection to Jerusalem,\" Parsons said. The future of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem remains uncertain, but the city's significance to both Israel and Christianity remains undeniable.",
    " Title: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Challenges Obama Administration's Immigration Policy in Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, longtime critic of the Obama administration's immigration policy, Arizona County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, took his case to a U.S. District Court on Monday, arguing that the president's executive order on immigration is unconstitutional. The hearing, the first courtroom challenge to the immigration actions, took place in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring the hearing, Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration, and his attorney Larry Klayman, argued before U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell. Klayman, after the hearing, expressed doubts about the lawsuit's constitutionality, stating, \"We have serious issues of constitutionality involved.\"\n\nJudge Howell, during the hearing, seemed skeptical of Arpaio's case, questioning whether he has the legal standing to challenge the president's action. She suggested that Congress might be in a better position to question the president's authority rather than a federal court.\n\nA lawyer for the Obama administration labeled Arpaio's case as a \"political dispute\" that should be dismissed. Howell, an Obama nominee, stated that she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKlayman and Arpaio argue that the president violated the Constitution by bypassing Congress and making drastic changes to immigration programs. They claim that the administration's policy change encourages more illegal immigration and increases the burden on law enforcement.\n\nThe case is separate from one filed by two-dozen states against Obama's immigration actions and another in which a federal judge last week declared Obama's immigration plans \"unconstitutional.\" However, Monday's hearing is the first to consider a direct challenge to Obama's orders.\n\nKlayman and Arpaio's lawsuit presents evidence such as a set of Arpaio's press releases and letters to Homeland Security officials, suggesting that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in Arpaio's jails in 2014 were repeat offenders.\n\nThe Justice Department argues that this theory is \"speculative and unsubstantiated.\" Obama's program places greater emphasis on removing criminal aliens and recent border crossers, the government countered.\n\nJennifer D. Elzea, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment on pending litigation. ICE, a DHS agency, can and does release immigrants who have been arrested on criminal charges, including those who have yet to be convicted, for a variety of reasons. In some instances, immigrants are released from immigration jails because they are from countries that won't provide travel documents or otherwise are not likely to be deported within a reasonable time.",
    " Title: Splinter Group of Central American Migrants Arrives in Tijuana as US Deploys Troops to Border\n\nArticle:\n\nA splinter group of approximately 400 Central American migrants, including members of the LGBTQ community, has reached the Mexican border city of Tijuana, marking the latest development in a growing migration caravan traveling towards the United States. This group separated from the larger caravan of 5,000 people in Mexico City.\n\nThe larger group, comprised of migrants fleeing persecution, poverty, and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, has been making their journey primarily on foot. The smaller group, which arrived in Tijuana on Tuesday, traveled aboard a fleet of buses. An earlier group of about 80 migrants, also predominantly LGBTQ, reached the border city on Sunday.\n\nThe smaller group reportedly parted ways with the main caravan due to what they described as discriminatory treatment by local residents and fellow travelers. Despite a harder US stance against them, the migrants have expressed their intention to continue their journey to claim asylum.\n\nThe journey began from the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras on October 13, a distance of approximately 4,350km (2,700 miles) from Tijuana. The route poses numerous dangers, including potential attacks by criminal gangs, leading many migrants to feel safer traveling in larger numbers.\n\nThe larger caravan, which is expected to arrive at the border in the coming days, began with more than 1,000 Hondurans and has grown with the addition of thousands more from neighboring Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has taken a firm stance against the caravan, which he refers to as an \"invasion,\" has ordered the deployment of up to 9,000 troops to the border. In response, US authorities closed down several lanes of traffic at two border crossings from Tijuana to California on Tuesday to install barbed wire fencing and barricades to reinforce security.\n\nUnder US law, there is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they express fear of violence in their home countries. Last week, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation temporarily barring migrants who enter illegally from claiming asylum.\n\nThe caravans became a campaign issue in the US mid-term elections that took place last week, with Mr. Trump warning without evidence that the caravans were filled with \"gang members,\" \"hardened criminals,\" and even \"Middle Eastern terrorists.\"\n\nThe arrival of the migrants in Tijuana continues to be a significant development in the ongoing migration crisis, as the US and Mexico grapple with the influx of migrants seeking asylum.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for Comedian Samantha Bee's Firing Over Crude Remark About Ivanka Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called for comedian Samantha Bee to be fired following her use of a vulgar term about his daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump on her cable television program. The incident marked the latest episode in a week-long debate over the language used by two television personalities, reflecting the country's political divide.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walt Disney Co's ABC network canceled a revival of the sitcom \"Roseanne\" after its star Roseanne Barr made a racist remark in a post on Twitter. Trump criticized ABC and Bob Iger, chief executive officer of Disney, on Twitter, but did not address the content of Barr's comments.\n\nHowever, Trump took exception to Bee's use of a crude term for the female anatomy to describe Ivanka Trump on her show \"Full Frontal\" on Wednesday, while discussing the president's controversial immigration policies.\n\n\"Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show?\" Trump said on Twitter on Friday. \"A total double standard but that's OK, we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!\"\n\nBoth Bee and the TBS cable network, which airs the show, apologized on Thursday. \"I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,\" Bee said on Twitter. \"It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's remarks on Friday, Sal Petruzzi, a TBS spokesman, said there would be no further comment beyond the earlier apologies. State Farm Insurance said it had suspended its commercials, while Autotrader also suspended its sponsorship, calling Bee's comments \"offensive\" in a statement.\n\nTrump's presidential candidacy was thrown into crisis in 2016 after a tape emerged of him boasting about being able to grab women by their genitalia because of his star status. He had made those comments as he waited to film a segment for the TV program \"Access Hollywood\" in 2005.\n\nAfter \"Roseanne\" was canceled, the White House said the president would not defend Barr's comments but pointed to alleged media bias against the TV show, which portrays a working-class American family. The program, which originally aired from 1988 to 1997, has drawn praise from Trump since its return. Its reboot featured Barr portraying a Trump voter facing off against her sister, an ardent opponent of the president, and tackled other issues reflecting America's political divide.\n\nTBS is owned by Time Warner Inc, which is seeking to merge with AT&T Inc in a move opposed by the Trump administration. Disney is seeking to merge with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.",
    " Title: Trump Shifts Focus from North Carolina Rally Chants to Criticism of Liberal Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to divert attention from the controversial chants at his North Carolina rally, President Donald Trump on Friday focused on the comments made by four liberal lawmakers regarding U.S. policy and Israel.\n\n\"They say things about Israel that's so bad I'm not even going to repeat them,\" Mr. Trump said as he left the White House for his New Jersey golf club. \"They can't get away with that act.\"\n\nThe President's comments came in response to a Greenville crowd chanting \"Send her back!\" on Wednesday, referring to Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee who became a U.S. citizen before being elected to Congress from Minnesota.\n\nMr. Trump has been critical of Ms. Omar, one of a quartet of freshmen Democrats known as \"The Squad,\" as being outside the mainstream. He has portrayed all four as the new \"extreme\" face of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn a Sunday tweet, he told the four to \"go back\" to their countries if they're unhappy. All four are citizens, and Ms. Omar is the only one who was born outside of the U.S.\n\nSince disavowing the chant on Thursday, Mr. Trump has focused on the liberal lawmakers' comments rather than addressing the criticism that he is fanning an ugly side of his base ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"I don't care if it's good or bad about politics. Many people say it's good. I don't know if it's good or bad,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I can tell you this\u2014you can't talk that way about our country, not while I'm president.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the liberal lawmakers are using their First Amendment rights when they complain about U.S. policy, Mr. Trump said: \"We have First Amendment rights, also. We can certainly feel and say what we want.\"\n\nMr. Trump also stated that he did not take any advice from First Lady Melania Trump or his daughter, Ivanka, on how to respond to the chants, denying reports to the contrary as \"fake news.\"",
    " Title: New Polls Indicate Persistent Opposition to Obamacare, as Support for President Obama's Signature Domestic Accomplishment Remains Low\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo recent polls have revealed a continued opposition to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The Washington Post/ABC News poll from yesterday showed a 30/55 majority deeming President Obama's presidency a failure, with a significant portion attributing this to his handling of Obamacare. The survey also reported a dismal 38/56 presidential approval rating on the implementation of Obamacare, and a majority opposed to the law itself, despite the poll's questionable wording that omitted any mention of 'Obamacare' or the 'Affordable Care Act.'\n\nA new Kaiser Family Foundation poll echoes these findings, with support for the president's signature domestic accomplishment significantly outweighed by opposition. This trend has persisted across hundreds of national surveys for years.\n\nOne major reason for the enduring opposition is the law's failure to meet many of the promises made in the sales pitch by dishonest ideologues. Another factor is the ongoing series of unfavorable developments, such as the recent revelation that Healthcare.gov was hacked last month.\n\nApologists for Obamacare may attempt to use selective data points to argue that the law is reducing premium costs and lowering overall health spending, but this is not the case. Individual market premiums skyrocketed in 2014, and are expected to increase by approximately 8% in 2015, with many consumers facing double-digit spikes. High out-of-pocket costs and narrow coverage networks are also prevalent.\n\nHealthcare industry expert Bob Laszewski has published a must-read post on next steps for Obamacare. He argues that the law has been largely out of the news for the past few months, but a fresh round of cancellations and the upcoming open enrollment period are set to bring Obamacare back into the spotlight.\n\nThe 2015 Obamacare open-enrollment period, scheduled to begin just 11 days after the November election, is expected to be problematic. The HealthCare.gov backroom is not yet built, a year and counting after it should have been. The exact number of people enrolled in Obamacare is unknown due to the lack of a government to insurance company accounting system.\n\nWith renewal and cancellation letters set to be sent out in October, and more pre-Obamacare policies being cancelled this year as their one-year extension ends, the Obamacare anxiety index is expected to rise significantly. Larger deductibles for 2015, more narrow networks, and generally higher rate increases for the most popular plans are also expected, ensuring a busy few months for Obamacare discussions.\n\nLarge businesses anticipate paying between 4 and 5 percent more for health-care benefits for their employees in 2015, according to employer surveys conducted this summer. Few employers plan to stop providing benefits due to federal health insurance mandates, but a third say they are considering cutting or reducing subsidies for employee family members. Employees are also paying more each year in out-of-pocket health care expenses.\n\nThe figures come from separate electronic surveys given to thousands of mid- to large-size firms across the country by Towers Watson, the National Business Group on Health, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, consulting groups that engage with businesses on health insurance issues.\n\nBracing themselves for an excise tax on high-cost plans coming in 2018 under the Affordable Care Act, 81 percent of employers surveyed by Towers Watson said they plan to moderately or significantly alter health-care benefits to reduce their costs.\n\nNumerous polls have consistently found that roughly twice as many Americans say they've been personally hurt by Obamacare than helped. However, most consumers report not being impacted one way or another. This, too, is expected to change for millions in the coming months and years.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that higher costs and reduced benefits are on the way for many who are among the large majority of Americans receiving health coverage through their employers. The White House knew this was coming, and Senate Democrats voted down a Republican effort to reinforce the president's \"keep your plan\" promise, which continues to crumble for consumers for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition to Obamacare remains strong, with support for the president's signature domestic accomplishment significantly outweighed by opposition. The law's failure to meet many of its promises, ongoing unfavorable developments, and the upcoming open enrollment period are expected to bring the law back into the spotlight, with potentially problematic consequences.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Criticizes President Trump in Senate Inauguration Preceded by Trump's Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected move, Mitt Romney, who is set to be sworn in to the Senate on Thursday, has publicly criticized President Donald Trump in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday night. Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, expressed his disapproval of Trump's conduct and character, stating that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\n\n\"When he won the election, I hoped he would rise to the occasion,\" Romney wrote. \"But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\nIn response, President Trump took to Twitter Wednesday morning, firing back at Romney. \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\" he wrote. \"Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn\u2019t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\"\n\nSome speculate that Romney's decision to speak out against the president's style, while still praising many of his policies and his appointment of conservative judges and Cabinet members, may position him as a potential replacement to Jeff Flake, the Republican who most often publicly criticized the president.\n\nIn 2016, Romney openly criticized Trump, calling the candidate a \"phony\" and \"fraud.\" Trump, in turn, criticized Romney, labeling him a \"failed presidential candidate\" who \"choked like a dog.\" After Trump's election, Romney changed his tune, and while he still said he thought the president was not \"a role model for my grandkids on the basis of his personal style,\" he praised some of the president's policy decisions and expressed interest in joining his administration. Trump also publicly supported Romney in his bid for the Senate.\n\nFor those interested in further discussion on Trump's presidency, a live discussion is being held in Los Angeles. Tickets are available.",
    " Title: Trump Pursues Bipartisan Tax Reform, Suggests Higher Taxes for Wealthy Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump is once again attempting to foster bipartisanship, as he met with a group of moderate members of Congress from both parties on Wednesday. In his latest effort to push for tax reform, Trump suggested that wealthy Americans may face higher taxes under a new plan he would negotiate with congressional Democrats.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump told reporters that wealthy Americans \"will go higher\" under a new tax plan, but he expects them to be \"pretty much where they are.\" The president's comments could potentially create a rift with Republicans, who generally oppose tax hikes. However, Trump's eagerness to strike a deal on tax reform may indicate his willingness to partner with Democrats.\n\nAs part of his tax push, Trump also scheduled a private dinner at the White House on Wednesday with congressional Democratic leaders, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California. The meetings come just one week after Trump made a deal to raise the debt ceiling with the Democratic leaders he referred to as \"Chuck and Nancy,\" which angered some Republicans and disrupted their legislative strategy through the end of the year.\n\nBuoyed by last week's deal, Trump appeared confident about an even bigger agreement over taxes. \"The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\" Trump said. \"We are looking for the middle class and we are looking for jobs \u2013 jobs being the economy.\"\n\nEarlier, Trump tweeted, \"The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut and Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!\" In his morning tweets, Trump linked his efforts to pass tax cuts with the need for recovery efforts from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n\nSome Republicans who generally oppose tax hikes said they would not reject out of hand Trump's idea that the wealthy may face higher taxes. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, \"That\u2019s not a non-starter for me.\" Meadows' priorities are cutting corporate taxes and doubling the standard deduction, but he said, \"I\u2019m willing to look at everything in trying to make sure that we get hard-working American taxpayers the most relief that we can.\"\n\nTrump has argued that cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code will spur economic growth, helping recovery in communities damaged in the recent storms. Most of the House moderates \u2013 eight Democrats, five Republicans \u2013 who met with Trump on Wednesday belong to the self-described \"Problem Solvers\" caucus, led by Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J.\n\nTrump and his team, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, will work with any Democrat \"willing to work with us to deliver this critical relief for the American people.\" The president is in no way abandoning Republicans, she said.\n\nAsked why GOP congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan were not invited to dinner with Schumer and Pelosi, Sanders said simply, \"You've got the leader of the Republican Party sitting at the table.\" A tax overhaul is a key promise for Trump and other Republicans. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., said the GOP base is \"very frustrated\" about the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, so the party must now deliver on tax reform. \"They want to see a pelt on the wall,\" he said of conservative voters. \"If it\u2019s not this, I don\u2019t know what it is.\"\n\nDespite Trump's enthusiasm for a deal, skeptics note that neither the Trump administration nor Congress have a specific tax plan yet. What's more, Trump's own positions remain unclear, as he has called for reducing the corporate tax rate, a move that would benefit wealthier taxpayers. And others questioned the connection between tax reform and hurricane relief \u2013 including key congressional Democrats such as Schumer. \"With all due respect to the president, a tax cut, particularly one for the very wealthy, is not going to help Florida or Texas rebuild from these storms,\" the Senate Democratic leader said.\n\nEconomic analyst Stan Collender, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, said the president has no way to leverage hurricane relief against a tax bill when it comes to votes in Congress. \"Trump is not going to veto a hurricane relief bill if it does not include tax reform and Congress is not going to be ready to do tax reform when the next relief dollars are needed,\" Collender said. \"More than anything, this shows that Trump does not understand legislative politics or process.\"\n\nRepublicans are wary of Trump's outreach to Democrats after last week's deal with Schumer and Pelosi that secured a three-month extension of the debt ceiling and the current federal spending plan. Trump's dinner meeting with Schumer and Pelosi could open the door to cooperation on other fronts, such as protecting undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. Trump has announced the end of the Obama-era policy that protected these 800,000 young immigrants from deportation, but he gave Congress a six-month deadline to address the issue and has indicated sympathy for these immigrants.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Ongoing Pursuit of Citizenship Question on 2020 Census Could Lead to Inaccurate Count and Potential Legal Challenges\n\nThe Trump administration's persistent efforts to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census, despite legal setbacks, could potentially lead to an undercount of residents in Democratic-leaning areas, according to legal and political experts. The constant media coverage linking citizenship and census forms could deter undocumented immigrants from responding and encourage President Donald Trump's base to participate, thereby influencing voting districts and federal funding distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial count of all residents, regardless of their legal status. The information collected serves as the basis for voting maps and distributing approximately $800 billion in federal funds each year. The Census Bureau is prohibited from sharing individual information with law enforcement or immigration authorities.\n\nThe proposed citizenship question, however, has sparked fears that it could be used as a tool for the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. The president and his allies argue that it is essential to know about citizenship status, but the question has been met with opposition from demographers, advocacy groups, corporations, and the Census Bureau's own staff, who claim it threatens the survey's integrity.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court blocked the question, citing a \"contrived\" rationale for its inclusion. However, the high court left open the possibility that the administration could offer a plausible rationale. Department of Justice lawyers have since stated they are exploring other explanations, and Trump has suggested he may attempt to force the question into the survey through an executive order.\n\nLegal experts have dismissed these ideas, stating that it will be challenging to convince justices that a new explanation is not also contrived, and an executive order would not override the Supreme Court decision or undo other court orders blocking the citizenship question. An executive order or addendum to the census forms could also face legal challenges for running afoul of various administrative laws.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has already filed a motion to prevent the citizenship question from being added. The ongoing legal debate surrounding the issue may already be negatively impacting the census and potentially helping Trump achieve his goals, according to experts.\n\n\"The longer he has this conversation, the worse it is for an accurate census count,\" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. The uncertainty and fear generated by the ongoing legal battle could lead to a lower response rate in communities with high immigrant and Latino populations, potentially benefiting non-Hispanic whites and helping Republicans gain seats in Congress and state legislatures.",
    " Title: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley Demands Action Against Cuba and Bolivia for Disrupting Political Prisoners Event, Causing Property Damage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive report, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has demanded action from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres after diplomats from Cuba and Bolivia disrupted a U.S. event on Tuesday, causing chaos and property damage at the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) chamber.\n\nThe event, titled \"Jailed for What? The plight of Cuba's political prisoners,\" was intended to highlight the plight of political prisoners in Cuba. However, the event descended into chaos when diplomats from the two countries, including Bolivian Ambassador Sacha Llorenti, disrupted the event by banging on tables and shouting slogans. Speakers, including former prisoners and relatives of those currently imprisoned under the communist regime, struggled to be heard over the noise.\n\nIn a letter to Guterres, sent Friday and obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, Haley called the behavior of the Cuban and Bolivian diplomats \"outrageous\" and demanded action from the U.N. Secretary-General. The letter states, \"Due to the outrageous behavior of the Cuban and Bolivian U.N. delegations, this diplomatic event became a mob scene, and resulted in significant damage to U.N. property.\"\n\nHaley called for Guterres to condemn the unprofessional conduct of the Cuban and Bolivian diplomats and require the two delegations to pay for the property damage they caused. Haley also criticized the U.N. for initially suggesting that the U.S. would be required to pay for the damage to desks and earphones, but later stating that the U.N. itself would bear the cost.\n\nHaley described this as \"completely unacceptable\" considering the U.S. is the largest contributor to the U.N. budget, paying 22 percent of the budget and therefore any repair costs. Instead, Haley demanded that the Bolivian and Cuban delegations be made to bear the cost.\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, Haley was critical of the behavior of the delegations, stating, \"Cuba's UN delegation destroyed property with their juvenile, unprofessional behavior that was a mockery of diplomacy.\" She added, \"There's no way the U.N. should pay for those repairs \u2013 with U.S. taxpayers footing 22 percent of that bill. The bill needs to be sent directly to Cuba.\"\n\nThe Cuban Mission has already demanded an investigation into how the event was allowed to take place, calling it \"a political comedy staged on false arguments and with supporting actors of a dark history at the service of a foreign power.\"\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that missions must certify that public meetings are consistent with the purposes and principles of the U.N. and that they are non-commercial in nature. He also stated that it is not the role of U.N. security to remove disruptive delegates unless they pose a physical threat.\n\nHaley welcomed the Cuban call for an investigation and called for the U.N. to investigate the damage and the misconduct by the Cuban and Bolivian delegations, including removing access to the U.N. for those responsible. Haley stated, \"This conduct was an assault on the dignity, ideals, and fundamental purposes of the U.N.\"\n\nDujarric told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Secretary-General's office had received the letter and was looking into it. The Bolivian and Cuban missions did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe event on Tuesday still went ahead, with speakers yelling over the protesters, but the U.S. stated that the event was delayed after the Cuban delegation refused to allow security to conduct a sweep of the chamber. U.S. ECOSOC Ambassador Kelley Currie, who led the event and herself had to yell over protesters to be heard, told reporters after the event, \"I have never in my life seen diplomats behave the way the Cuban delegation did today. It was really shocking and disturbing, and it makes you wonder what kind of behavior the police of this government exhibit.\"\n\nHaley, who is stepping down from her role at Turtle Bay in January, has been vocal in standing for the interests of the U.S. and its allies at the U.N. Last week, she criticized the U.N. General Assembly for electing a number of countries with poor human rights records to the controversial Human Rights Council, including Eritrea, Cameroon, Somalia, and Bangladesh. \"This lack of standards continues to undermine the organization and demonstrates again why the United States was right to withdraw from it earlier this year,\" she said.",
    " Title: Lamenting the Exit of Rick Perry from the 2016 Presidential Race: A Critique of the Election Process\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent withdrawal of Rick Perry from the 2016 presidential race has sparked a wave of criticism, with many commentators viewing it as a missed opportunity for the Republican Party. The decision, they argue, is a reflection of the preferences of Republican voters, the Republican Party apparatus, and the media institutions that prioritized entertainment over substance in the early stages of the campaign.\n\nThe GOP, according to these critics, needed Rick Perry in the debates not for his debating skills, but for his qualifications and the story he represented. The question is whether people truly believe Rick Perry is a less credible presidential candidate than Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina, or that Chris Christie has a better chance at uniting the party and winning the White House.\n\nThe criticism is directed not only at the voters but also at the Republican National Committee and media organizations that set the rules for entry. During a time when little attention was paid to the election, these institutions surrendered their authority to opinion polls, favoring low-polling candidates who could gain attention through unconventional means.\n\nRick Perry, until recently the long-serving governor of Texas, should have been able to leverage his state's success to his advantage. Texas, with its thriving cities, economic recovery, and diverse population, offers a story that the Republican Party should be eager to share with the rest of the country. The record of success in Texas, they argue, should have been enough to overcome some of Rick Perry's debating deficiencies.\n\nThe debates, while necessary, should not be the measure of a presidency. If the best debaters made the best presidents, the argument goes, the country would be experiencing unprecedented conservative governance led by successive Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes administrations. The fact that Rick Perry's candidacy was buried by early polling numbers is seen as a travesty, a result of an over-worshipful deference to democratic-looking tools like opinion polls.\n\nThe election process, critics argue, unfairly favors electoral curiosities, candidates who can only credibly represent one sect within the national party, or free-media bonanza candidates like Donald Trump. Four years ago, Rick Perry's tax plan and campaign performance were criticized, but he made credible moves to improve his policy shop and became one of the brainier candidates in the race. The records that Chris Christie, Scott Walker, and Bobby Jindal are touting are far more ambiguous than Perry's.\n\nFor the sake of the party, and for the sake of honoring the success of Republican governance in a large state, Rick Perry's presidential aspirations needed to be protected from the hurricane-season of stupidity. He did not lose because he is a loser, but because of pure dumb luck.",
    " Title: Minority Children in U.S. Face Disproportionate Disadvantage in Low-Opportunity Neighborhoods, Study Finds\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by researchers at Brandeis University and Ohio State University has revealed that a significant number of minority children in the United States live in low-opportunity neighborhoods, compared to their white counterparts. The study, which analyzed data from diversitydatakids.org, found that about 40 percent of black children and 32 percent of Hispanic children reside in the lowest-opportunity neighborhoods in their respective metropolitan areas, while only 9 percent of white children do so.\n\nThe researchers examined various neighborhoods, considering socioeconomic indicators such as housing foreclosure rates and access to basic educational and health-care facilities. The findings indicate that minority children are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods that lack access to early childhood education centers, parks, health-care facilities, and other essential resources.\n\nThe study's data show that white children, even in the cities where they are worst off, do not experience the same level of disadvantage as minority children. For instance, in Honolulu, 23 percent of white children live in the lowest-opportunity neighborhoods, while in New York state's Albany metro area, 60.3 percent of the area's black children live in the worst neighborhoods, and in Boston, 57.6 percent of Hispanic children reside in similar conditions.\n\nResearch has shown that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood can have long-lasting consequences for children. A 2008 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is equivalent to missing a year or more of school, and the negative impact persists even after the child moves out of the area.\n\nThe issue of neighborhood disparities has been previously addressed by authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates in \"The Case for Reparations,\" focusing on Chicago, one of the most economically and racially segregated major U.S. cities. The average per capita income of Chicago's white neighborhoods is almost three times that of its black neighborhoods, and incarceration rates in black neighborhoods are significantly higher than in white neighborhoods.\n\nThe findings of the Child Opportunity Index suggest that these neighborhood disparities persist across the nation, placing America's minority children on a worse trajectory at the start of their lives.",
    " Title: Philip Bilden Withdraws as Secretary of the Navy Nominee Over Privacy and Business Conflicts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Philip Bilden, President Donald Trump's nominee for the position of Secretary of the Navy, has withdrawn from consideration for the post, citing concerns about privacy and separating himself from his business interests.\n\nBilden, an intelligence officer in the army reserve from 1986 to 1996, had relocated to Hong Kong to set up an Asian presence for HarbourVest Partners, a global private equity management firm. He recently retired from HarbourVest Partners after 25 years.\n\nThis marks the second instance of a Trump nominee for a military post withdrawing before confirmation. Earlier this month, Vincent Viola, a West Point graduate and former airborne officer, withdrew from consideration to be Secretary of the Army. Viola, the founder of several businesses, including the electronic trading firm Virtu Financial, also owns the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers and is a past chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nViola had cited his inability to successfully navigate the confirmation process and defense department rules concerning family businesses. The Army post remains unfilled.\n\nReports of Bilden's withdrawal had been circulating for days, but were denied by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who said he was 100% committed to the role. However, in a statement on Sunday, the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, confirmed the withdrawal and stated that Bilden had informed him of the decision and that he would make a recommendation for a new nominee in the coming days.\n\n\"This was a personal decision driven by privacy concerns and significant challenges he faced in separating himself from his business interests,\" Mattis said.\n\nIn his own statement, Bilden said, \"I informed Secretary of Defense Mattis with regret that I respectfully withdraw from consideration as nominee for the 76th secretary of the navy.\" He had determined that he would not be able to satisfy Office of Government Ethics requirements without what he called \"undue disruption and materially adverse divestment of my family's private financial interests.\"",
    " Title: House Republican Leadership Crisis: McCarthy Steps Down, Leaving Uncertain Succession Path\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has announced his decision to withdraw from the race for Speaker of the House, plunging the House Republican Conference into a leadership scramble not seen in more than a decade. The decision leaves the House with no apparent line of succession to power, as the party grapples with ideological divisions and a lack of clarity on their governing agenda amidst several legislative battles in the coming weeks.\n\nThe House Republicans find themselves in a state of chaos, torn between two ideological poles with no clear sense of who will serve as their next leader. The general consensus inside the House Republican Conference is that there is just one man standing who can garner the 218 votes needed to be speaker: Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Ryan, who has resisted calls to run in the past, is now being urged by the top two Republicans\u2014Speaker John Boehner and McCarthy\u2014to reconsider his position.\n\nMcCarthy's decision was influenced by a host of factors, including the creation of the Select Committee on Benghazi, which was seen as an attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and the perception that he would face the same problems that dogged Speaker John Boehner.\n\nAs McCarthy steps down as majority leader, there will be no race for his position or whip. Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Tom Price of Georgia, who had been running for the majority leader job, will abandon their campaigns. Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Pete Sessions of Texas, and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma will all be forced to abandon their campaigns for whip.\n\nThe Republican Party will reconvene on Friday for a special GOP conference meeting, in an attempt to unite the party and find a new leader. The conservative House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly 40 Republicans, continues to loom large, having endorsed Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida on Wednesday and vowing to vote together in the closed party election.\n\nThe chaos in the House Republican Conference harkens back to another dark time for the party, during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton in 1998. In that instance, Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston plunged the House into chaos by admitting to extramarital affairs and resigning from Congress, just as he was set to take the job from the outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich. The ensuing scramble for the speakership was won by Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who helped soothe the battered Republican Conference and went on to serve as the longest-serving Republican speaker.\n\nSeventeen years later, the Republicans need a soothing force once again. The process of finding that force will begin on Friday, as the party retreats to a room in the Capitol basement for a special GOP conference meeting. Party leaders want to get the Republican lawmakers on the same page, in an effort to present a unified front and move forward in the face of this historic leadership crisis.",
    " Title: President Trump Honors Heroes of El Paso and Dayton Shootings, Renewing Debate on Gun Control\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a solemn ceremony at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump honored 11 individuals who displayed extraordinary courage during the twin mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in early August. The president presented the nation's highest award for public safety officers to six police officers who confronted the gunman in the Dayton shooting, and five civilians who helped others during the El Paso shooting.\n\n\"On Saturday, August 3rd, a soulless and bigoted monster killed 22 innocent people and wounded 27 others at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. It was a racist attack motivated by pure evil,\" Trump said, referring to the El Paso shooting. \"The next day in Dayton, Ohio, a vile and wicked murderer stole nine lives and injured 34 others.\"\n\nThe president's remarks came as he honored the heroes of both tragedies. In Dayton, officers Sgt. William Knight, Officers Brian Rolfes, Jeremy Campbell, Vincent Carter, Ryan Nabel, and David Denlinger were awarded the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor. The officers returned fire on the gunman, but it remains unclear which officer or officers fatally shot the shooter, Connor Betts, who was wearing a mask and bullet-proof vest and carrying a semi-automatic pistol modified with an extended-capacity drum magazine.\n\nIn El Paso, five civilians\u2014Robert Evans, Gilbert Serna, Marisela Luna, Angelica Silva, and Chris Grant\u2014risked their lives to help others. Grant, who was still recovering from a pair of gunshot wounds, threw bottles and other merchandise at the gunman, Patrick Crusius, to distract him and prevent him from shooting others.\n\nTrump praised the heroes' actions, saying, \"In the darkness moments of danger and despair, God calls the bravest to action. These 11 individuals answered the call. They stared down evil. They put love of neighbor above life itself, and we are blessed by their courage.\"\n\nThe twin shootings have sparked renewed national discussion on gun control, with Democrats and mayors from cities affected by mass shootings, including Dayton, pressuring the Senate and White House to act on House bills calling for stricter background checks. The president has at times expressed support for tougher background checks but has also questioned their value and praised the NRA since the latest mass shootings.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Secretary Kerry's Iran Nuclear Program Timeline: A Closer Look at Centrifuge Expansion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent press conference, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the expansion of Iran's nuclear program and its impact on the ongoing nuclear negotiations. Kerry suggested that the majority of Iran's enrichment capability was developed during the Obama administration. However, a closer examination of reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and analyses by leading research institutions reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nAccording to available data, Iran had approximately 3,000 centrifuges in late 2007. Over the course of the Bush administration's final 12 to 15 months, it is estimated that Iran added to, but did not fully double, the number of centrifuges it had installed. This would place the number of centrifuges Iran had at the beginning of the Obama administration at around 5,000.\n\nThis means that roughly 25% of the current total of centrifuges was installed during the Bush-Cheney era, while approximately 74% were installed during the Obama-Biden administration. Analysts say that 10,000 of the total are actively enriching uranium to low levels, inconsistent with nuclear weapons production but well suited to the task should a decision be made to pursue that goal.\n\nIn interviews before leaving Geneva, Kerry expanded on his theme, telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that Iran made an offer to the Bush administration in 2003 to make major concessions on their nuclear program, but the offer was not taken. Kerry's concise history of the Iranian nuclear program, which encompassed only the years 2003 and 2013, omitted significant details, as determining exactly when the regime crossed a given technical threshold can be difficult due to the opacity of the government and the complex of commercial, military, and scientific institutions that have contributed to the program over the last two decades.\n\nSecretary Kerry is set to testify before Congress on Iran, for the first time since the deal was announced, in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Dec. 10, an opportunity to provide more clarity. When asked about the expansion in Iran's centrifuge program during the Obama administration, a spokeswoman for Kerry, Jen Psaki, acknowledged that Iran has made progress on enrichment and developing a nuclear weapon. However, when confronted with the notion that at least 70% of the expansion in Iran's centrifuge program took place on President Obama's watch, Psaki countered that the focus is on halting and rolling back the progress of Iran's program and working towards a comprehensive agreement to bring an end to it.",
    " Title: Senator Jeff Merkley Announces Support for Iran Nuclear Deal, Narrowing Gap for President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon has announced his intention to support the Iran nuclear deal, bringing the number of senators publicly favoring the agreement to 31. This move places President Barack Obama just three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.\n\nSenator Merkley, in a statement issued on Sunday, described the accord as \"the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\" The deal, if approved, would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nWith Merkley's support, the Senate now has 31 senators publicly in favor of the deal. Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position. If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress has until September 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. President Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it reaches his desk.\n\nWhile Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators - Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey - have joined them so far. Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland's Ben Cardin and New Jersey's Cory Booker.\n\nThe only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after September 7.\n\nIn his statement on his website, Senator Merkley pledged to vote for the deal while pointing to \"significant shortcomings\" that he said the U.S. must address with \"a massive intelligence program\" and monitoring. Merkley expressed concerns about the deal's allowance for Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and the lack of restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.\n\nHowever, he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms. If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, \"the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,\" Merkley said.\n\nWhile the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it's unclear whether the Senate does. Assuming all 54 Senate Republicans oppose the accord, they would need support from six Democrats to get the 60 votes necessary to advance a resolution.",
    " Title: Republican Strategist's Predictions on Trump's Impeachment and Reelection Campaign Come to Fruition\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump unfold, a series of events predicted by political analysts and strategists in 2018 are coming to fruition. In April 2018, political commentator and longtime Republican, Mark McKinnon, wrote an article titled \"Trump 2020 Campaign Forecast: 99 Percent Chance of Thunder and Lightning,\" in which he stated that the president could concurrently campaign for reelection while fighting impeachment.\n\nNow, a year later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump. McKinnon's continued fascination with this potential scenario prompted a piece he wrote on Sept. 21, 2018, headlined \"Will Trump's Reelection Campaign Collide with Impeachment?\"\n\nSince Tuesday, McKinnon has been receiving nonstop texts and emails from the Trump campaign and allied GOP organizations with messages that parrot and operationalize the strategic concepts stated in the quoted passages below.\n\nVeteran GOP strategist Roger Stone, in an April 2018 interview, mentioned that he believed President Trump would run for reelection even if impeachment proceedings were ongoing and that Trump would turn impeachment into a campaign advantage.\n\nThe second quote McKinnon used was from a Sept. 12, 2018, report in Axios: \"He [Trump] has already told confidants how he would run for reelection in 2020 if impeached (but not removed) by playing the victim card.\"\n\nSince Pelosi's announcement, McKinnon has been witnessing the predicted message strategy appear on his electronic devices: Turn impeachment into a campaign advantage; play the victim card; exploit the circumstances, all geared to raising money.\n\nThe messages bombarding McKinnon's inbox assume that as a Republican, he will overlook and excuse Trump's \"Ukraine-gate\" behavior no matter how egregious and potentially impeachable. McKinnon, however, is troubled by this assumption and is concerned about the potential constitutional crisis that the impeachment proceedings may bring.\n\nMcKinnon is not alone in his concerns. He wonders if other Republicans who feel the same but are afraid to speak out exist. McKinnon concludes his article by questioning Senator Lindsey Graham, asking, \"WWJMD?\" (What Would John McCain Do?) and expressing his belief that McCain's answer would include citing the name of Sen. Howard Baker, a Republican who famously asked, \"What did he know, and when did he know it?\" during the Watergate hearings.\n\nAs the impeachment proceedings continue, the question remains: Will Republican elected leaders and voters stand with President Trump no matter what, even if the evidence proves he violated his oath of office? And will our nation careen towards a monumental constitutional crisis that will plunge our nation into an \"uncivil war\"? These questions hammer home why this is a difficult time for many Republicans who care about how Trump's behavior sets a precedent for future presidents.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama Steps into the Political Spotlight, Raising Funds for Key 2013 Races\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing political turmoil in Washington, Michelle Obama, the First Lady, has emerged as a beacon of popularity and political acumen, proving her mettle on the campaign trail despite the ongoing scandals that have engulfed the White House. Arguably the most popular surrogate for her husband's 2012 reelection campaign, Michelle Obama is currently stumping for key 2013 races.\n\nOn Thursday, she will be raising funds for Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chief running for Virginia's governorship, at a hotel fundraiser in Fairfax County. The Virginia race, an off-season election, is critical, as the state, captured twice by President Obama, is a key battleground for both parties.\n\nJosh Schwerin, McAuliffe's campaign spokesman, said, \"Michelle Obama has been a leader on standing up for women, military families, and children. Terry McAuliffe is committed to continuing that work. She is one of the most popular figures in America, and we're really excited to have her here in Virginia.\"\n\nThe first lady's appearance in Virginia is significant, as the state is a crucial battleground for both parties. The contest between Mr. McAuliffe and GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli is heating up, and both candidates are trying to woo female voters and reach across the aisle to build a winning coalition to succeed Republican incumbent Bob McDonnell.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, commented, \"The first lady is traditionally a great draw for a big crowd, and she has little of the downside presented by her husband's controversies. People assume that the first lady is not involved in Oval Office skullduggery, and usually, this is the correct evaluation. Pat Nixon had no involvement with Watergate, and Hillary Clinton certainly was not aware of Monica Lewinsky's services to her husband.\"\n\nLast week, Michelle Obama brought in an estimated $600,000 for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D), who is running for the US Senate in Massachusetts against Republican Gabriel Gomez. Obama has also appeared recently at the Democratic National Committee's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Leadership gala in New York City.\n\nAt these events, the first lady's message is that in backing these candidates or issues, voters are helping her husband's cause. And Republicans, with a national leadership void, don't really have an equally charismatic foil for her.\n\nAt 48 percent, President Obama's approval rating has slipped below the 50 percent watermark, according to Gallup. By contrast, Gallup's most recent polling of the public's view of the first lady showed her with a 65 percent favorable rating.\n\nTracy Sefl, a Washington-based Democratic consultant, said the first lady \"speaks with a combination of accessible language and emotion,\" and \"audiences find her magnetic.\" And at campaign events, of course, she doesn't have to delve into the weeds of congressional inquiries. The questions or interruptions that have sometimes intruded on the president's public events don't pop up when the first lady hits the trail.\n\n\"Her calendar is highly strategic, obviously,\" Sefl adds. \"Democrats recognize that her appearances on behalf of marquee candidates like Terry McAuliffe are all the more valuable during this lighter election cycle year. The spotlight she commands becomes even brighter. She's proven to be a Teflon first lady.\"\n\nHowever, could the recent appearances reflect something more than a savvy political use of the more popular Obama? In the waning months of her husband's tenure, Hillary Clinton turned her attention to a US Senate bid in New York, so could this be an early sign of how formidable a candidate Michelle Obama might be?\n\nOr has the Princeton and Harvard Law grad effectively tired of the Washington scene?\n\nProfessor Sabato, for his part, thinks the first lady \u2013 despite her proven campaign skills \u2013 will probably move onto other things.\n\n\"I'd be willing to bet Michelle Obama won't run for office,\" he says. \"While she's clearly enjoying the platform her current unofficial office brings, she would not have chosen politics as the family profession. Hillary Clinton is the exception that proves the rule about first ladies. Unlike Hillary, the rest have been quite happy to move back into semi-private life once the White House tour of duty is over.\"\n\nMichelle Obama will appear Thursday for McAuliffe at the Sheraton in Tysons Corner. Tickets range from $100 to $750; several hundred supporters are expected.",
    " Title: Trump's Inauguration: Call for Transparency and Disclosure of Obama-Era Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, he faces a wave of skepticism and doubts about his legitimacy. Critics may accuse him of governing in unprecedented and reckless ways. However, a proactive approach to transparency could help counter these charges.\n\nIn this regard, President Trump could follow the example set by President Obama, who, shortly after taking office in 2009, released secret Bush administration legal memos detailing the justification for policies such as torture, domestic deployment of troops, and warrantless surveillance. This move signaled a new era in Washington and helped solidify Obama's reputation as a champion of civil liberties.\n\nIn the spirit of turnabout being fair play, Trump should swiftly disclose the secret memos underlying his administration's \"targeted killing\" drone assassination program. The Obama administration fought lawsuits by the ACLU, The New York Times, and others seeking disclosure of key legal papers on the drone program. A Trump administration could release these memos without compromising national security, but it would undoubtedly damage the reputation of the former president and his policymakers.\n\nFurthermore, Trump should reveal the paper trail surrounding U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War. The U.S. has armed and financed Syrian rebels, some of which are linked to Al Qaeda, despite federal law prohibiting material support to terrorist groups. Americans deserve to see the bureaucratic evidence of this fiasco.\n\nTrump should also disclose the records leading to and following the U.S. bombing of Libya in 2011. The U.S. attack on Libya, labeled as \"smart power at its best\" by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has led to chaos in the nation ever since. What did the U.S. government know, and when did it know it, regarding the likely effects of toppling Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi?\n\nTransparency could help prevent similar mistakes in the future. It is naive to assume that \"truth will out\" from federal bureaucracies. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has become largely ineffective under the Obama administration, with federal agencies denying access to information and censoring government files at an unprecedented rate.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, some might have blamed the State Department's slow-walking of FOIA requests for her emails (which she improperly kept on a private server). The FBI worked through 650,000 emails from Anthony Weiner's computer in eight days, but the State Department claimed it needed 75 years to fully answer a FOIA request on Hillary Clinton's aides' emails. A federal judge and the agency's inspector general slammed its FOIA stonewalling.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also has a poor FOIA record. The agency permitted political appointees to stifle FOIA responses in a process that \"reeks of a Nixonian enemies list,\" according to former House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Darrell Issa. Under Obama, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), part of the DHS, became more intrusive and abusive, launching \"enhanced patdowns\" that, as some noted, \"require screeners to touch passengers' breasts and genitals.\" The TSA conceals almost all information regarding its groping (which has caught zero terrorists, or else we would have heard about it a hundred times) with a \"sensitive security information\" FOIA designation that justifies perpetual secrecy. Exposing TSA coverups and reining in the agency would create a bounty of early goodwill for the Trump administration.\n\nHouse GOP should not be exempt from ethics scrutiny. Trump's promise to end and replace the Affordable Care Act would be greatly assisted by releasing the memos behind Obama's endless \"fixes\" to that law. For instance, a van-load of senior IRS financial managers were summoned in 2014 to the Old Executive Office Building and only permitted a peek at a secret Office of Management and Budget memo explaining why the Obama administration was entitled to spend $3.9 billion on subsidies for consumer health insurance. As The New York Times reported last year, the IRS officials \"were told they could read it but could not take notes or make copies. The OMB officials left the room to allow their visitors a moment to absorb the document, and then returned to answer a few questions.\" Federal judge Rosemary Collyer recently slammed the administration's actions as unconstitutional.\n\nMany sweeping regulations have been rushed into law with shaky rationales or scant evidence. Obama relied on \"bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency,\" according to The New York Times, issuing 50% more \"major regulations\" than the George W. Bush administration. The Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies have been scandalized by switcheroos to suppress information federal law required them to disclose. Opening the books would be especially helpful for the torrent of midnight edicts the Obama team has issued in recent months.\n\nRecent polls show that fewer than 20% of Americans now trust the federal government. Excessive secrecy spurs many Americans to presume that their rulers are up to no good. Regardless of the policies that Trump chooses, it would be a booster shot for democracy to reveal the back story of the Obama era.",
    " Title: Gender Pay Gap Remains Stagnant Despite Decades of Progress, New Research Shows\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday marks Equal Pay Day, a day set aside each year to highlight the wage disparity between men and women. The National Committee on Pay Equity, a coalition of women's, civil rights, and labor groups, uses this day to emphasize the number of additional days women must work to earn what men made in the previous year.\n\nIn 1963, when President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, a woman working full-time year-round typically earned 59 cents for every dollar paid to her male counterpart. By 2013, the latest year of available census data, this figure had risen to 78 cents on the dollar. Another measure by the Institute for Women's Policy Research shows that in 2014, the ratio of female-to-male weekly earnings was 82.5 percent.\n\nWhile this may seem like slow but steady progress, a closer examination reveals that progress in closing the gender pay gap has essentially come to a standstill over the past decade. The longer the gap persists, the less it can be attributed to factors other than discrimination.\n\nFor instance, recent research by the Economic Policy Institute shows that men still outearn women at every income level. The higher up the income ladder, the wider the gap. In 2014, women in the 95th percentile of female earners made 79 percent of what men at the 95th percentile earned, while women in the lowest 10th percentile made 91 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. At the high end, corporate norms are likely the primary influencers of pay scales, and while policies differ from company to company, the result is that women are still paid significantly less than men. At the low end, the minimum wage is a significant factor influencing pay scales, and since this applies to everyone, there is less pay disparity at the bottom of the ladder. However, even at that, women in low-wage jobs are paid less than men in low-wage jobs.\n\nThe gender pay gap is also evident among college-educated workers. The higher the level of education, the wider the gap. Men and women who have attended but did not graduate from college have the narrowest gap, with women making about 80 percent of what men made (or about $16 an hour on average for women versus $20 for men). Among those who have graduated from college, women's pay is about 78 percent of men's pay (or about $26 an hour on average for women; $33 for men), and among those with advanced degrees, women make about 74 percent of what men make (or about $33 an hour on average for women; $44 for men).\n\nThe persistence of the gender pay gap underscores the need for continued efforts to address this issue and promote pay equity.",
    " Title: Analysis of EPA's Tier 3 Gasoline Regulations: Costs Outweigh Benefits, Critics Argue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been implementing a series of regulations since President Obama's 2009 inauguration, with a total of 1,920 rules to date. Critics argue that many of these regulations, including the latest Tier 3 gasoline regulations, will impose high economic and unemployment costs while providing minimal health or environmental benefits.\n\nThe Tier 3 regulations, aimed at further improving air quality by reducing sulfur in gasoline, have been met with criticism from various sectors, including the American Petroleum Institute and air pollution experts. According to these critics, the Tier 3 improvements would yield negligible air quality or health benefits when earlier and ongoing reductions are factored in.\n\nAir pollution expert Joel Schwartz, co-author of \"Air Quality in America,\" notes that since 1970, America's cars have eliminated 99 percent of pollutants that once came out of tailpipes. He adds that recent models start out cleaner and stay cleaner throughout their lives, reducing on-road emissions by an average of 8 to 10 percent per year.\n\nThe Tier 1 and 2 rules, implemented since 2004, have already resulted in a 90 percent drop in sulfur in gasoline. By 2022, existing emission-reduction requirements will further slash volatile organic pollutants by 62 percent, carbon monoxide by 51 percent, and nitrous oxides by 80 percent.\n\nHowever, the EPA's proposed Tier 3 standards would cost $10 billion in upfront capital expenditures and an additional $2.4 billion in annual compliance expenses, according to industry experts. These costs could raise the price of gasoline by 6 to 9 cents per gallon, on top of new state fuel-tax hikes and rising gasoline prices under President Obama's administration.\n\nCritics argue that these costs could have a ripple effect on the economy, affecting job creation and retention, the price of goods and services, commuting costs, and the price tag on family vacations. They also argue that these Tier 3 rules are part of the administration's war on coal and other fossil fuels, and are loaded on top of other rules that address risks and achieve benefits that exist only in EPA and environmental-activist computer models.\n\nAnother concern is the EPA's assumption that there is no safe threshold level for pollutants and that they must constantly be ratcheted downward, eventually to zero. This contradicts the understanding of any competent epidemiologist, who knows that the dose makes the poison.\n\nCritics argue that the EPA's actions are forcing the expenditure of vast financial, human, and technological resources to achieve minimal or even zero quantifiable health benefits. They call for science-based standards and common-sense regulations, and suggest that scrapping the unnecessary Tier 3 rules is a good place to start.\n\nPaul Driessen, senior policy adviser for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow and author of \"Eco-Imperialism: Green Power, Black Death,\" emphasizes the need for a balanced approach to environmental regulation that considers the costs and benefits. He argues that coal, oil, and natural gas provide 84 percent of the energy that powers America and makes our health and living standards possible, while wind, solar, and biofuel sources provide less than 4 percent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tier 3 gasoline regulations have been met with criticism from various sectors due to their high costs and minimal benefits. Critics argue that the EPA should focus on science-based standards and common-sense regulations, and that scrapping the unnecessary Tier 3 rules is a good place to start. The debate continues as citizens and lawmakers grapple with the balance between environmental protection and economic growth.",
    " Title: Unveiling the Invisible: The Role of Women in Radical Islamic Jihad\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling revelation, experts have estimated that approximately 30 Muslim women from the West, predominantly British, have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, sparking shock among the wider public. This development underscores the long-standing role of Muslim women as potent radicalizing forces in Islamic jihad.\n\nThe case of these women, who have been monitored by experts at Kings College International Center for Radicalization in Britain, highlights their significant influence in attracting other women to ISIS and supporting the group's procreation efforts. The online activities of the 21 women among the 500 Britons thought to be in Syria with ISIS, which has fighters from over 81 nations, reveal their active role in promoting the extremist ideology.\n\nThe women's motivations for joining ISIS are varied. Some are responding to ISIS' leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has called upon them to help build the new Islamic State and assume traditional roles of marriage and childbearing. Others are skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses, and engineers, who are sought after by ISIS. However, a significant number of these women are also seeking combat, serving as foot soldiers and even waging war.\n\nThe recent case of 19-year-old Sharon Conley of Colorado, a newly converted American who seeks jihad, is a chilling example of female radicalization in the West. Even under FBI interrogation, she remained committed to waging jihad.\n\nFemale Islamists, including violent jihadists, have long been prominent. In 2010, Afia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist from Pakistan, was found guilty in New York City of attempted murder of U.S. personnel investigating her material support to Al Qaeda. She is now serving an 86-year sentence in federal prison.\n\nThe phenomenon of female jihadists, who can become suicide bombers, is a grave concern. Their motivations are as numerous as their identities, ranging from seeking martyrdom to political activism. Regardless of their motivations, these women serve a fleeting purpose for extremist groups like ISIS, often losing their freedoms as they empower Islamism through their actions.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize the deadly ideology that attracts these women for what it is: lethally totalitarian, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, supremacist, and profoundly anti-democratic. By unveiling these invisible women for the radical jihadists they truly are, we can begin to confront Islamist ideology for what it is: a singularly lethal assault upon our sacred ideals.",

Never before in 20 plus years has this happened.\n\nHouse Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, during a press conference after the meeting, stated that ICE determined the guest list. Initially, the list excluded all members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, but the Democrats were able to convince them to invite the caucus chairwoman, Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\nCaucus members said the decision to exclude them was striking as they had initiated the Tuesday meeting with Homan to discuss the raids happening in cities across the country. Agents have arrested more than 680 undocumented immigrants in what Donald Trump touted on Twitter as a \"crackdown on illegal criminals.\"\n\nA bipartisan meeting with the acting director was arranged for Thursday, but members of the Hispanic Caucus were not invited. Guti\u00e9rrez and Torres attempted to enter the meeting, while other members of the caucus waited outside. Guti\u00e9rrez was asked to leave first, followed by Torres.\n\nAfter leaving the meeting, the Democrats waited outside with other members of the caucus and held a prayer vigil for the families affected by the immigrant raids.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for the House speaker, Paul Ryan, stated that his office had organized the briefing and \"at the request of DHS, limited to members with jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement.\"\n\n\"Members of the CHC expressed interest in attending, and to accommodate the request, we welcomed the chair of the CHC to join on behalf of the other members,\" she said. \"We are confident that the CHC chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the CHC ahead of time.\"\n\nPelosi stated in a press conference afterward, \"I've never seen anything like it, and hopefully, never [will] again.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris of California took to the floor of the Senate for the first time since she was sworn in last month to denounce the president's actions on immigration.\n\n\"I rise because the president's actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities,\" Harris said. \"I rise on behalf of California's 250,000 'dreamers' who were told by the federal government, 'if you sign up, we won't use your personal information against you.' I rise to say the United States of America cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families.\"\n\nAcross the country on Thursday, immigrants\u2014naturalized citizens, legal residents, and undocumented\u2014refused to go to work in protest against Trump's immigration actions. The boycott, known as a \"day without immigrants,\" was intended to highlight immigrants' contributions to the American workforce.\n\nRaids and mass detentions were tools that Obama frequently used from 2009 to 2017, and he deported at least 2.4 million people, more than any previous president. However, the first operations of Trump's presidency fanned fears around the country that his promised plan to deport millions of undocumented people had begun.\n\nICE has stated that the raids were \"routine\" and no different than the arrests, detentions, and deportations carried out under the Obama administration, which targeted undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds or repeated immigration violations. An ICE official on Thursday said Homan told attendees that the immigration officers target pre-identified individuals for arrest at specific locations. He said that in the course of these raids, agents frequently encounter other immigrants who are living in the US unlawfully and they too are arrested.",
    " Title: President Trump and London Mayor Engage in Public Spat Ahead of State Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan as he arrived in England for a three-day state visit. The tweets, posted as Air Force One touched down, read:\n\n\"Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly 'nasty' to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\"\n\n\"Khan reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!\"\n\nThe war of words began with an op-ed by Khan in the Observer, where he called Donald Trump \"one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat.\" Khan accused Trump of stoking the rise of the \"far right\" around the world. Trump is seen as a figurehead of this global far-right movement.\n\nIn a separate diplomatic incident, Trump on Sunday denied calling Meghan Markle, now a member of the royal family, \"nasty.\" In an audio recording of his comment to The Sun newspaper, Trump did use the word nasty, but he also was complimentary about Meghan. The details of the exchange were reported by various media outlets.\n\nThe London mayor and the president's comments come as tensions between the two leaders have been high. Khan has been critical of Trump's policies, particularly his travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and his stance on climate change. Trump, in turn, has criticized Khan's handling of crime in London and his response to terror attacks in the city.\n\nThe state visit is expected to be a contentious affair, with large protests planned in London. The visit is also expected to include a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and a state banquet in Trump's honor. It remains to be seen how the two leaders will interact during the visit.",
    " Title: Hawaii Legislature to Debate Marriage Equality Act in Special Session\n\nThe state of Hawaii is set to become the 15th state to legalize same-sex marriage, as the state's Legislature convenes for a special session on Monday to consider the Marriage Equality Act. Governor Neil Abercrombie has called for the session to allow lawmakers to deliberate on the bill, which would extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage in Hawaii is not a new issue. In 1990, gay couples who applied for a marriage license in the state sparked the national debate that led to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a federal law that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nProponents of the bill, including Governor Abercrombie, are capitalizing on the national momentum in favor of marriage equality. They argue that the bill aligns with Hawaii's Aloha spirit of equality and could boost tourism. Opponents, however, have organized protests, contending that the issue should be decided by Hawaiian voters, not the state's lawmakers.\n\nGay marriage was in a legal limbo in Hawaii after 1993, when the state's supreme court ruled in favor of same-sex unions. However, a constitutional amendment adopted five years later transferred jurisdiction from the courts to the Legislature, which then banned same-sex marriages.\n\nOver the weekend, rallies organized by both sides of the issue took place in Honolulu, as reported by Hawaii News Now. More rallies are scheduled for Monday. The Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii has also weighed in, voting in support of the bill, marking the largest denomination to announce its support of the issue that has divided people of faith.\n\nIf the measure is approved, it would take effect on November 18. A public hearing on the matter will be part of the special session on Monday, according to the Hawaii Legislature's website. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia currently recognize same-sex marriages, while 35 states have enacted laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples.",
    " Title: 2020 Presidential Candidates Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren Suggest Post-Presidency Prosecution of Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent interviews, two Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have hinted at the possibility of prosecuting President Donald Trump once he leaves office. Harris, in a newly released interview on the NPR Politics Podcast, stated that if she were to win the White House, her Justice Department would likely charge Trump with obstruction of justice.\n\nHarris, a former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney, emphasized the importance of accountability and stated that everyone, including the president, should be held accountable for their actions. She cited the Justice Department's policy against indicting a sitting president as the reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump. However, once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges, according to Harris.\n\nHarris is not the only high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump but also face criminal charges once out of office. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reportedly told colleagues last week, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\"\n\nSen. Warren also recently suggested that Trump would be \"carried out in handcuffs\" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) defended Pelosi's remarks, comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired \"lock her up\" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhen asked about advocating for Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said, \"no one is above the law.\" Booker, however, left the question open, stating that if his attorney general found probable cause that a law had been broken, he would hold the alleged offender accountable.\n\nPresident Trump reacted to Pelosi's remarks by calling her a \"nasty, vindictive, horrible person.\" Trump has been accused of looking into prosecuting Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey in the past. The 2018 New York Times report also stated that Trump considered prosecuting Clinton.\n\nThe possibility of prosecuting a former president is a complex issue, and it remains to be seen whether any charges would be brought against Trump once he leaves office. However, the comments from these Democratic candidates highlight the growing tension between the two parties and the potential legal consequences that could follow the end of Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: NRCC Launches Fake News Websites to Disguise Political Messaging\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised ethical concerns, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has reportedly launched a series of fake news websites to disseminate Republican messaging, disguised as local news. The websites, such as \"Des Moines Update\" and \"Aurora Update,\" are tailored to the districts of Democratic candidates, presenting neutral news articles that transition into more partisan content.\n\nThe sites, according to National Journal's Shane Goldmacher, have been promoted across the country with localized Google search ads. The \"articles\" on these sites mimic the structure of local news websites, featuring sections for \"Most Popular\" articles and \"Most Viewed\" videos, all sourced from NRCC opposition research.\n\nThe deceptive nature of these sites is evident, with the \"Paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee\" disclaimer hidden at the bottom of each page, well beneath the \"Return to Top\" link. The lede of many articles often presents a neutral stance, before transitioning into more partisan content.\n\nFor instance, an article on the \"Tuscon Update\" website, targeting Arizona Democrat Ron Barber, questions his stance on pay equality, citing an Arizona Daily Star article that was, in fact, an NRCC attack on Barber. This practice, known as talking-point laundering, represents a streamlined approach to the traditional process of disguising GOP messaging as news, which previously relied on the lax ethics standards of certain cable news outlets.\n\nThe NRCC's use of these fake news websites has sparked controversy and raised questions about the ethical boundaries of political campaigning. The committee's strategy, while innovative, has been criticized for its deceptive nature and potential to mislead voters.",
    " Title: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Criticizes Social Media Companies for Fostering Polarization and Confirmation Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising interview at the Wired 25 conference on Monday, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos expressed concerns about the role of social media companies in promoting polarization and confirmation bias. When asked about the current state of technology, Bezos stated, \"I think social media is increasing, unfortunately, identity politics and tribalism. I think the internet in its current incarnation is a confirmation bias machine.\"\n\nBezos' comments came in response to Wired editor-at-large Steven Levy's question about how he views the current challenging times for technology. A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that social media algorithms rely on confirmation biases to surface the most relevant content for users.\n\nThe study, co-authored by Alessandro Bessi, a postdoctoral researcher with the Information Science Institute at the University of Southern California, showed that social media users tend to search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.\n\nLast week, Facebook announced it had removed 800 pages and accounts that were stirring up political engagement ahead of November's midterm elections by publishing misleading or fake stories that preyed on people's ingrained biases. Google's search has consistently been accused of political bias, with most headlines a user sees selected via Google's algorithms based on past usage history on Google Search, YouTube, the News app itself, and other properties.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been criticized for allowing tribalistic abuse to run rampant on the platform, with Dorsey recently announcing a plan to start addressing the problem.\n\nDespite the egregious shortcomings of technology, Bezos remains optimistic about its potential. He argued that it's better to disrupt than not innovate at all. \"The last thing you'd ever want to do is stop the progress of new technologies even when they are dual use,\" he said, referring to technologies with both beneficial and harmful applications.\n\nBezos also welcomed scrutiny and criticism, stating, \"You want risk-taking\u2014you want people to have a vision that most people don't agree with. You have to find something where your particular life path has led you to see something in a particular way so you can pursue it, contribute to society... but in a unique way.\"\n\nWhile Bezos pointed the finger at social media giants, he also acknowledged the need for self-reflection and improvement in the technology industry. As any technologist would posit, Bezos believes ultimately it's better to disrupt than not innovate at all.",
    " Title: Misleading Crowd Photos: A Common Technique in Post-Pandemic Scenes\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the world gradually returns to normalcy, photographs and videos of seemingly crowded public spaces have been circulating, sparking concerns about social distancing compliance. However, these images may not be as alarming as they appear, thanks to a common camera technique.\n\nPhotographers often use a zoom or telephoto lens to capture crowds, a method that compresses the foreground and background of a picture, making everyone look closer together. This technique, as explained in an article by Outdoor Photography Guide, \"compresses the crowd and makes it look larger yet more compact, creating more vibrant, more amplified photos.\"\n\nThis means that the photo of a \"crowd\" may actually depict a sparsely populated beach or park. This technique can be used to deliberately mislead, but it's also a convenient way to show many people in a crowd without having them appear at different sizes or with significant space between them.\n\nIt's essential to note that a photographer who uses this technique is not necessarily trying to deceive; they may have other reasons for photographing the scene in a specific way. For instance, a newspaper editor pointed out that the photographer of a widely-shared beach reopening shot \"shot the photo... with a long lens because she wanted to get as much of the beach as she could to accurately depict the scene.\"\n\nTo illustrate the impact of different camera lens lengths, landscape architect Jeff Cutler photographed a local beach with several different lenses to demonstrate how each one perceives a crowd. This camera trick also applies to video, as shown in a tweet featuring a boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, which appears to be \"packed\" but is actually misrepresented by the camera lens.\n\nThese misleading crowd shots are problematic as we navigate reopening because people are anxious about crowds. Many of us are trying to avoid crowds and these shots make it seem like our neighbors are disregarding physical distancing rules. While some may indeed be, the situation is likely not as dire as the photos suggest.\n\nFor example, a photo of a restaurant that reopened with enforced distancing rules might appear to show a lack of compliance, but another angle (supplied by the restaurant) could tell a different story.\n\nMoreover, these photos and videos serve as fuel for social media debates, escalating tensions further. If infections don't rise with reopening\u2014perhaps due to people being cautious during outings and maintaining proper distance\u2014some will undoubtedly use these photos to claim that everything was crowded, and the reopening was successful despite the apparent lack of social distancing.",
    " Title: Six Key Factors to Watch in the CNBC Republican Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Republican presidential campaign enters a more competitive phase, the upcoming CNBC debate on Wednesday promises to be a heated contest. The GOP field is experiencing a shake-up, with Donald Trump no longer holding a commanding lead due to the rise of Ben Carson. Jeb Bush is struggling, but is expected to show a more assertive side. Carly Fiorina has failed to capitalize on strong debate performances, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has left the race. Here are six key factors to watch in the CNBC debate:\n\n1. Trump vs. Carson: The frontrunner, Donald Trump, is expected to take aim at Ben Carson, who has overtaken him in several polls. Trump's attacks could get personal, and Carson, known for his reserved demeanor, may have to defend himself against Trump's criticisms.\n\n2. Jeb Bush's Resurgence: Jeb Bush will be two spots removed from Trump for the first time, signaling his recent struggles. Bush's advisers are suggesting he may try to show a more fiery and loose side in an attempt to stand out from the crowd.\n\n3. Carly Fiorina's Momentum: Carly Fiorina, who had a breakout performance in the last debate, will aim to translate her success into lasting poll numbers. However, her national poll numbers have dropped significantly since her rise in September.\n\n4. The Debt Limit: The issue of raising the debt ceiling could divide the Republican candidates, with some arguing against increasing national spending and others advocating for spending cuts to make it worthwhile.\n\n5. Lower-Tier Candidates: Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Rand Paul, who have been at the bottom of the polls for most of the race, will be under pressure to boost their rankings and persuade donors to continue funding their campaigns.\n\n6. Time Constraints: The debate will be only two hours long, with less time for candidates to answer questions, go after rivals, and make a splash. This could make it challenging for candidates to make an impact and stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe CNBC debate is set to take place on Wednesday, October 28, with 10 candidates participating in the prime-time debate. The debate will be closely watched as the race for the Republican nomination heats up.",
    " Title: Former Gov. Mark Sanford Seeks Old Congressional Seat in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political comeback, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who was disgraced by an extramarital affair, has announced his candidacy for the open seat in the state's 1st Congressional District. The vacancy was triggered by the resignation of Republican Rep. Tim Scott, who was appointed to replace outgoing Sen. Jim DeMint in December.\n\nSanford, who once held the same congressional seat before running for governor, is one of 16 Republican candidates vying for the position. His colorful past, marked by a bitter divorce from his wife, Jenny, and a notorious affair, is far from the only distraction in the race.\n\nOne of Sanford's GOP rivals, Teddy Turner, is the son of CNN founder Ted Turner. Turner's family ties, deep pockets, and sudden rise in some internal polling have made him a significant target. Opponents are filling mailboxes with attack ads, with some tying the candidate to one of his father's ex-wives, Jane Fonda.\n\n\"You know it's absolutely amazing how dirty the game is, how expensive the game is. It just doesn't make sense,\" Turner said.\n\nIf that's not enough to grab the voters' attention, the winner of Tuesday's Republican primary will likely face the Democratic favorite, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Her brother, Stephen Colbert, is the host of Comedy Central's \"Colbert Report.\" However, Colbert Busch insists her candidacy is no joke.\n\n\"This is not a joke. I don't think anybody would think that this was a joke. This is all too important,\" Colbert Busch told CNN.\n\nMany of the other candidates in the race also deserve to be taken seriously. One potential spoiler on the Republican side is State Sen. Larry Grooms, who has collected some important local endorsements and boasts a staff that includes Hogan Gidley, a former spokesman for Rick Santorum, a former senator and Republican presidential candidate in 2012.\n\nWith such a short election schedule and a crowded field, the race could turn on name recognition, potentially giving Sanford an advantage. Despite his transgressions, Sanford maintains he is worthy of the public trust. He insists he learned some important life lessons after wandering off-trail.\n\n\"Oddly enough, I think you learn from the valleys of life rather than the peaks,\" Sanford said.",
    " Title: Trump's Remarks on Steve Bannon Suggest Possible Distance from White House Strategist\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, President Donald Trump's comments about his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, have sparked speculation about Bannon's future in the White House. During a conversation, Trump was asked about his feelings towards Bannon, and his response has raised eyebrows.\n\n\"I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\" Trump said. \"I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn't know Steve. I'm my own strategist and it wasn't like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\"\n\nThis statement, reminiscent of Trump's past comments about his campaign team, has historical significance. According to political analyst Bill Palmer, the last two times the Trump administration has distanced itself from a top campaign lieutenant, the individuals in question, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, were later implicated in the ongoing investigation of Russian espionage ties to Trump's presidential bid.\n\nWhether Trump's comments imply that Bannon, too, may be under investigation for ties to Russian figures is unclear. However, Trump's statement \"he was not involved in my campaign until very late\" in response to \"do you have confidence in Steve Bannon?\" is a clear indication that Trump may be considering distancing himself from Bannon.\n\nThe White House has yet to comment further on the matter, leaving the future of Bannon's role in the administration uncertain. As the situation unfolds, the relationship between Trump and Bannon will continue to be a topic of interest and speculation.",
    " Title: Fact-Check: Bernie Sanders' Tax Proposal and the 52% Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the ninth Democratic debate, multiple social media posts have circulated, claiming that 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is proposing a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000 a year. These claims, found on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit, often juxtapose this extreme tax-hike with Sanders' signature proposals, such as the increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and Medicare for All.\n\nHowever, a thorough examination of the debate transcript and video reveals that Sanders did not propose a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000. The 52% figure appears to stem from a memo released by Sanders' Senate office ahead of the introduction of the Medicare for All Act of 2019. The memo discusses various tax proposals to finance his healthcare program, not all of which were mentioned during the debate.\n\nDuring the debate, Sanders did discuss financing Medicare for All through a mixture of different taxes, including a progressive income tax, a payroll tax, and a 4% income-based premium applicable to all households making more than $29,000. The 4% premium is the only evident proposal that could raise taxes on incomes above $29,000.\n\nIt is important to note that the 52% tax rate, as mentioned in the memo, is strictly applied to incomes over $10 million, not $29,000. The current marginal tax rate for a household making more than $29,000 (and below $40,124) is 12%.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Bernie Sanders plans to tax anyone making above $29,000 a year 52% is false. Sanders has not proposed a 52% tax rate on incomes above $29,000. The 52% tax rate mentioned in the memo is applied to incomes over $10 million.",
    " Title: The Rise of the Grassroots: Challenging the GOP Establishment and the Pursuit of Real Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the Republican Party has been grappling with a recurring pattern of establishment candidates' failures, as evidenced by the likes of Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Bob Dole, who have opened the doors to the Obama and Clinton eras. Even when establishment candidates manage to win office, such as George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, their presidencies are often considered unsuccessful. The only undeniably successful Republican president of the modern era, Ronald Reagan, overcame the opposition of the GOP establishment.\n\nThis pattern continues in the Senate, where today's Republican superstars were yesterday's GOP primary enemies, including Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. The Republican establishment hopes to make voters forget their past opposition, just as they did with Reagan.\n\nA prime example of the establishment's questionable candidate choices is former Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who was the establishment's choice for senator. When primary voters chose Marco Rubio instead, Crist abandoned the party to run as an independent and has since become a registered Democrat. This is the same figure the GOP insiders supported instead of Rubio.\n\nKarl Rove, often referred to as the consummate insider, has launched the Conservative Victory Project to protect entrenched Republicans against future Marco Rubios. This is concerning, given Rove's role in pushing for George W. Bush's government expansion, including the TARP bank bailouts and the largest expansion of Medicare in the program's history.\n\nIn contrast, the GOP establishment's record of choosing candidates is a lesson in abject failure, as demonstrated by their losses and the economic and moral deficit they've contributed to during their long tenures in Washington. Compared to this, Sarah Palin's record of choosing candidates, including Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and others, is marked by success.\n\nEntering the 2014 elections, there are 13 Republican senators who face re-election. Their average tenure in Washington is more than 18 years. In that time, federal spending has nearly doubled, and our national debt has tripled. The current Republicans have proven themselves uninterested or incapable of addressing this economic and moral deficit of stealing from our children.\n\nA new, independent upstart called The Real Conservatives National Committee aims to do the grass-roots work that the RNC refuses to do. The committee hopes to break the juggernaut of the GOP establishment and elect real conservative leaders.\n\n\"The RNC and the Karl Roves have been choosing our candidates for way too long,\" says committee Chairman Lorie Medina. \"We're positioning ourselves to take out useless Republicans in the primaries and [President] Obama's minions in the general. Rove can keep his fat-cat donors. We've got the real conservatives on our side.\"\n\nInsiders have reason to worry. Election guru Nate Silver recently analyzed Republican insurgent campaigns and found that grass-roots challengers were able to win nearly half of the primary races against the GOP establishment candidates despite being massively outspent 5-to-1 or even 10-to-1. That shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that recent polling shows Congress has become less popular than colonoscopies and cockroaches.\n\nWe need more Ted Cruzes and Mike Lees, more Rand Pauls and Marco Rubios, and we can't just sit around waiting for the GOP establishment to deliver. They haven't, and they won't. It's time to take a page out of Sarah Palin's playbook. It's time to take on the establishment. For the sake of our party and the republic, it's time to lock and load.",
    " Title: NRA Files Lawsuit Against Florida Over New Gun Law, Challenging Age Restriction on Firearm Purchases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift response to the recent gun control legislation signed by Florida Governor Rick Scott, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida in the Northern District of Florida. The lawsuit, filed on Friday, contends that the new Florida law, which raises the age to buy firearms to 21, violates the Second and 14th Amendments of the US Constitution.\n\nThe NRA's complaint argues that the bill is particularly offensive to young adults, specifically women under the age of 21, who are \"much less likely to engage in violent crime than older members of the general population who are unaffected by the ban.\" The lawsuit asserts that the bill infringes upon the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nThe Florida bill, which includes new gun control measures, also opens the door to arming some school employees as part of new school security measures. School districts can participate in \"school guardianship\" programs that train and arm school employees.\n\nThe NRA's lawsuit names Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Rick Swearingen, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as defendants. Bondi, a Republican, said in a statement that she is proud of the law. \"This bill is not perfect, and sadly it will not bring back the 17 lives lost in the horrific school shooting, but the safety of our children is not a political issue \u2014 it\u2019s simply the right thing to do,\" she said.\n\nCameron Kasky, one of the survivors of the February 14 Parkland shooting, responded to the Florida bill on Twitter, stating that it was only the first step. The NRA's lawsuit is a response to the bill's provisions that raise the age to buy firearms to 21 and impose a three-day waiting period on most firearms, ban bump stocks, and allow police to petition in court for a risk protection order, which would let authorities restrict gun and ammunition possession for those considered a danger to themselves or others. The bill does not include an assault weapons ban.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Grapple with the Threat Posed by American Fighters in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Syrian conflict enters its fifth year, U.S. intelligence officials are grappling with the growing number of American citizens who are traveling to Syria to join the fighting. According to these officials, at least 140 U.S. passport holders have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq since the beginning of the year, more than doubling the number since the start of 2014.\n\nThe problem, according to U.S. officials, is that it is difficult to determine which groups these fighters have joined. Fighting for groups such as the Islamic State, which has been designated a terrorist organization, or al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, is a violation of U.S. law. However, with thousands of groups fighting in Syria, it is difficult to sort out who is a threat and who is not.\n\nOne such American fighter is Eric Harroun, a former Army private who spent about six weeks fighting with rebel groups in Syria. Harroun, who was initially linked to the Free Syrian Army, provided a visual atlas of his journey by posting a steady stream of videos on Facebook and YouTube. However, Harroun later joined an avowedly anti-American Islamist fighting force called the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades, leading to his arrest on terrorism charges upon his return to the U.S.\n\nHarroun's case is a cautionary tale for U.S. officials, who are increasingly concerned about the growing number of Americans traveling to Syria to fight. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, followed Harroun's case as it played out on YouTube.\n\n\"Eric Harroun's story in Syria is one of an American concerned about the Middle East who enters the very chaotic situation inside of Syria and gets caught up in a game that is beyond his comprehension,\" says Tabler. \"Unfortunately he was caught on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nHarroun's case is not unique. U.S. law enforcement has started arresting people before they leave for Syria, with a handful arrested so far this year, nearly all of which have some connection to the Islamic State. However, U.S. officials are still trying to determine the extent of the threat posed by these fighters and whether they are a danger to national security.\n\nIn the end, Harroun's story ended tragically, with his death from an overdose of prescription pills in April. His family said the death was an accident. The case of Eric Harroun serves as a reminder of the dangers and complexities of the Syrian conflict, and the challenges U.S. officials face in trying to gauge the threat posed by American fighters in Syria.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Primary Challenge from Former Governor Mark Sanford: A First for the 2020 Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has announced his challenge to President Donald Trump in the 2020 Republican primary race. This marks the first official challenge to the incumbent president, who remains popular within the Republican party.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Mr. Sanford expressed his concerns about the current state of the Republican party, stating, \"I think we need to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican. I think that as a Republican party we have lost our way.\"\n\nMr. Sanford, who served as a congressman from 1995 to 2019, has previously criticized President Trump but ultimately supported him during the 2016 presidential election. However, he became one of the president's toughest Republican critics in Congress after taking office. This stance cost him the Republican primary when his seat was up for re-election last year.\n\nPresident Trump, in response, described Mr. Sanford, two other hopefuls, and his extramarital affair with an Argentine woman in 2009 as \"badly failed candidates.\" He also referred to Mr. Sanford's mistress as his \"flaming dancer friend.\"\n\nAnalysts do not expect Mr. Trump's challengers to succeed in wrestling the Republican mantle from him. No sitting president in the modern era has lost the race to be the nominee for their own party. The Republican National Convention, at which the nominee will be formally chosen, will take place in late August 2020 after a series of state primary elections and party caucuses.\n\nWhile some state Republican parties have decided not to hold primaries in 2020 to clear the path for Mr. Trump and save money, others, including South Carolina, have opted to hold primaries. The primary results could potentially reveal the extent of dissention within the Republican ranks.\n\nMr. Sanford is expected to center his campaign on cutting government debt and spending, issues he believes the president has not adequately addressed. This primary challenge, while not expected to pose a serious threat to the president, could potentially expose weaknesses and distract from general-election preparations.\n\nThe race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump is already well underway, with several candidates already in the running. As the 2020 election approaches, the political landscape will continue to evolve, and the race to the White House promises to be an exciting and closely contested one.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order on Law Enforcement Reform Amidst Nationwide Protests and Calls for Police Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the ongoing nationwide protests and calls for police reform following the death of George Floyd, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled \"Safe Policing for Safe Communities\" on Tuesday. The order, which aims to uphold clear and high policing standards, promote accountability in law enforcement, and equip police officers for constructive community engagement, is the latest move in the administration's response to the ongoing unrest.\n\nThe executive order, according to the White House, will touch on use of force best practices, information sharing to track officers with repeated complaints, and federal incentives for police departments to deploy non-police experts on issues like mental health, homelessness, and addiction.\n\nDuring a Monday roundtable, Trump did not provide specific details about the order, but stated that it would offer \"some solutions.\" He emphasized that the order is about \"law and order, justice, and safety.\"\n\nThe order comes as Trump has been grappling with backlash over his handling of the unrest following Floyd's death, trying to balance his desire to be a \"LAW & ORDER!\" president with his campaign's efforts to court black voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has been sparring with local officials over his handling of the protests and riots. Trump has faced criticism over his reported push to consider having active-duty military handle the protests and riots, particularly over an incident in which federal law enforcement cleared protesters from Lafayette Square.\n\nTrump is now threatening to step in with federal forces to clear out protesters from a six-block area of downtown Seattle, named the \"Capitol Hill Organized Protest\" or CHOP, which has been declared \"cop-free\" by its occupants.\n\nThe order comes as Georgia's Lieutenant Governor says the state must \"build trust\" after the \"very disturbing\" death of Rayshard Brooks. The White House, in a separate tweet, emphasized that the order would \"help law enforcement build trust and effectively serve the community as our first line of defense here at home.\"\n\nThe executive order could be added to the record of criminal justice reform legislation Trump signed in 2018. However, efforts in Congress to pass legislation on criminal justice reform appear to have hit obstacles, with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., stating that addressing qualified immunity is a \"poison pill\" for Republicans, while Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has led calls to roll back qualified immunity in Congress, has received different signals from other Republicans.\n\nMultiple Atlanta officers have resigned this month as morale is said to be at an all-time low. The order's impact on police departments across the nation remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Michigan Uber Driver Charged in Deadly Shooting Spree\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the suspect accused of carrying out a deadly shooting rampage in Michigan on Saturday night has been identified as Jason Dalton, a married father of two who was working as an Uber driver.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Dalton, 45, passed a background check when he was hired by Uber. Police reports indicate that Dalton had no criminal record and only five traffic violations.\n\nAuthorities are currently investigating a Facebook post that suggests Dalton may have picked up Uber customers around the time of the shootings. Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting confirmed that he is aware of the post but declined to discuss it further.\n\nDalton resided in a ranch-style house with his wife of at least 15 years and two children, ages 10 and 15, according to USA Today.\n\nThe shooting spree began around 6 p.m. in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Richland Township, where a woman was shot and seriously wounded. The suspect was arrested about 12:40 a.m., authorities said.\n\nFour people were killed and a 14-year-old girl was wounded outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a father and son were killed outside a Kia dealership, and a woman was shot outside an apartment complex. A 14-year-old girl was in critical condition, while the woman shot outside the apartment complex was in serious condition as of early Sunday.\n\nKalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas said earlier that authorities did not believe the shootings were targeted at specific people, describing them as \"our worst-case scenario.\"\n\nMichigan State Police Lt. Dale Hinz called the shooting spree \"incomprehensible.\" Kalamazoo, with a population of about 75,000, is about 160 miles west of Detroit. It is home to Western Michigan University and the headquarters of popular craft beer maker Bell's Brewery. The city is also known for the anonymously funded Kalamazoo Promise program, which has paid college tuition for students who graduate from Kalamazoo Public Schools for over a decade.",
    " Title: Saudi Arabia Affirms Two Million Barrels Per Day Spare Capacity, Stops Short of Committing to Trump's 2 Million Barrels Daily Oil Production Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON/RIYADH - In a statement released on Saturday, the leader of Saudi Arabia, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance. This statement comes after President Donald Trump's tweet earlier in the day suggesting that Saudi Arabia had agreed to produce more oil, potentially up to 2 million barrels per day.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump and King Salman discussed the oil market during their conversation on Friday, with the Saudi leader expressing readiness to raise production if needed. However, the statement did not confirm a 2 million barrels per day increase, which would be significantly more than the 700,000 to 1 million barrels per day increase agreed upon by OPEC and non-OPEC nations, including Russia, on June 22.\n\nTrump's tweet suggested that the additional Saudi oil would help offset a decline in supply from Iran, following the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May and the subsequent imposition of oil sanctions. Trump did not specify whether the 2 million barrels per day was a daily figure, but worldwide daily demand is nearing 100 million barrels per day.\n\nSaudi state media reported that during the call, the Saudi king and Trump emphasized the need to preserve oil market stability and efforts of oil-producing countries to compensate for any potential shortage. The statement reported by Saudi media did not mention any intention by Saudi Arabia to raise production by 2 million barrels per day. Saudi oil officials did not comment.\n\nA source familiar with the kingdom's plans told media outlets last week that Riyadh plans to boost output in July to 11 million barrels per day, the highest in its history, up from 10.8 million barrels per day in June. Saudi Arabia has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million barrels per day, but it has never tested that level of production.\n\nAmrita Sen, of consultancy Energy Aspects, stated that while Saudi Arabia has the capacity in theory, it takes time and money to bring these barrels online, up to one year. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was trading around $79 a barrel on Friday, and a Reuters poll showed prices look to remain strong for the rest of this year due to supply disruptions in countries including Libya and Venezuela and as the extra oil from OPEC fails to meet rising demand.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday to discuss energy security. The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November when the United States re-imposes sanctions against Tehran, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six major powers, against the advice of allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions once they are re-imposed, with the aim of pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement. State Department officials said this week the United States is prepared to work with countries on a case-by-case basis to help them reduce imports of Iranian oil and suggested some exemptions were possible.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Washington of trying to turn Iranians against their government, stating that six U.S. presidents before him tried this and had to give up. Iran's rial currency has lost up to 40% of its value since last month, when Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, accused the United States and Saudi Arabia of trying to push up oil prices and said both countries are acting against the foundation of OPEC.",
    " Title: Justice Department Faces Challenges in Investigating George Zimmerman for Civil Rights Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department is encountering obstacles in its investigation of potential civil rights violations by George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, with the main hurdle being the lack of evidence indicating racial bias on Zimmerman's part before the 2012 shooting.\n\nIn the aftermath of Zimmerman's acquittal, the department announced its intention to consider a possible federal case. However, previously filed FBI documents reveal that agents have not uncovered any accounts suggesting Zimmerman exhibited racial bias prior to the shooting. Sanford police detective Chris Serino also told FBI agents last year that he considered Zimmerman as having \"a little hero complex,\" but not as a racist.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, in his first post-verdict comments, confirmed on Monday during a speech in Washington, D.C., that the department continues to investigate while expressing concern for the Martin family and those advocating for a federal case. He stated that the department is \"mindful of the pain felt by our nation\" over the \"tragic, unnecessary shooting death\" of Martin.\n\nHolder emphasized the opportunity for open dialogue about the charged issues involved in the case and urged that \"we must not... let this opportunity pass.\" He also suggested the possibility of bias in this case, stating it's important to address \"underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents.\"\n\nThe attorney general reiterated that the department would act in a manner \"consistent with the facts and the law.\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney indicated that President Obama would keep his distance from the consideration, adding that the merits of the case will be \"evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice.\"\n\nFlorida defense attorney Brian Tannebaum told FoxNews.com that the \"number one challenge\" for the DOJ is the evidence, or lack thereof. Tannebaum stated, \"There's been an acquittal. The evidence has not changed. It's not like the feds are going to go in and find more evidence.\" Tannebaum expressed understanding of the Justice Department's response to public sentiment but stated, \"I don't foresee it becoming a federal case.\"\n\nThe question of racial bias is crucial because, if the Justice Department were to pursue a federal case against Zimmerman, federal hate-crimes law is one of the few tools the department would have. The statute bars \"willfully\" causing injury to someone else \"because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person.\"\n\nThe department has used federal civil rights law before to pursue defendants who had been acquitted at the state level. However, in what is perhaps the most famous such case\u2014the Rodney King beating\u2014the circumstances were different. First, there was a highly publicized video of the King beating. No such video of the Martin shooting is known to exist. Second, the two officers ultimately convicted on federal charges in that case were charged with using or permitting unreasonable force under \"color of law\"\u2014this applies only to law enforcement. The separate federal hate-crimes law applies to both law enforcement and civilians, but it's not clear how the Justice Department could prove racial bias.\n\nSerino, the Sanford detective, told FBI agents last year that after examining the case, it appeared Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin because of his \"attire, the total circumstances of the encounter, and the previous burglary suspects in the community.\" Serino told the FBI that there had been several burglaries in the area, and that gang members in the community \"typically dressed in black and wore hoodies.\"\n\n\"When Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody, Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious,\" Serino said, while describing Zimmerman as \"overzealous.\" The FBI document was posted on the Smoking Gun website.\n\nMcClatchy also has reported on another set of documents that show FBI agents interviewed dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias, but nobody would say Zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting.\n\nThe department may find itself in a vulnerable spot, not only because of prior interviews which found no evidence of bias, but also due to allegations of intervention in the case by an obscure agency within the DOJ. Last week, a conservative watchdog accused this agency of helping support the \"pressure campaign\" against Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting last year.\n\nThe department, however, claims that it dispatched agency representatives to reduce tensions in the community\u2014not to take sides. The department is under heavy pressure from some groups to pursue the case further. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and other House Democrats called a press conference on Monday to urge the Justice Department to \"conduct an immediate and thorough investigation.\" The NAACP started the drive to pressure the DOJ to continue its probe by posting a petition Sunday morning on the website MoveOn.org.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Looming Deadlines as Obama Administration Warns of Early Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is facing a potential fiscal crisis as the Obama administration has warned House Republicans that a deal on increasing the federal debt limit may need to be reached earlier than expected. The warning came in a letter from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to House Speaker John Boehner, who is currently on summer recess and not expected to return until early September.\n\nThe looming deadlines include the need for a temporary spending deal to prevent a partial government shutdown and the need to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default. The spending deal is typically reached without much partisan wrangling, but this year's effort is complicated by Republicans insisting that any measure should include the steep cuts known as sequester, and by some Democrats insisting they be removed. Additionally, a small group of Tea Party-backed Republicans is pushing for funding for the president's health care law to be stripped from any budget bill.\n\nIn his letter on Monday, Lew stated that the Treasury Department will run out of \"extraordinary measures\" in the middle of October, risking a default unless Congress raises the cap. \"Extending borrowing authority does not increase government spending; it simply allows the Treasury to pay for expenditures Congress has previously approved,\" Lew told Boehner.\n\nBoehner's office responded by stating that the debt ceiling is a reminder that \"under President Obama, Washington has failed to deal seriously with America's debt and deficit.\" Boehner and Obama reached a complex deal in 2011, agreeing to roughly $900 billion in immediate spending cuts in exchange for an increase in borrowing authority by a similar amount. However, the high-wire act had a major economic impact, roiling financial markets worldwide and contributing to Standard & Poor's downgrading the credit rating on U.S. bonds.\n\nThe debt ceiling currently stands at $16.7 trillion. Economists had for months predicted the federal government would no longer be able to pay its bills after Labor Day, but at least some thought the deadline was closer to November. Lew told Congress that if the government cannot increase its borrowing authority, it must use the $50 billion in cash held by the Treasury, with no solid way of predicting when all of that money will be spent.\n\nThe White House and a group of Republican senators have reportedly been working on proposed fiscal deals to avoid last-minute negotiations, but those talks have stalled. Boehner indicated last week that he wants to pass a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, but he reportedly vowed on Monday to put up a \"whale of a fight\" over the debt limit.\n\n\"I've made it clear that we're not going to increase the debt limit without cuts and reforms that are greater than the increase in the debt limit,\" Boehner said at a fundraiser for Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson. Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, after Lew's letter urged the GOP to increase the debt limit. \"With just nine legislative days currently scheduled in September, Republicans must return to Congress prepared to move beyond the kind of brinksmanship that undermined our economic recovery two years ago,\" he said. \"It is time for Republicans to do the right thing \u2013 not the far right thing.\"",
    " Title: Mainstream Media's Response to Hurricane Irma Sparks Controversy Amidst Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Irma's devastating path through Florida, a storm that displaced up to five million people, the response of the national media, or the Mainstream Media, has come under scrutiny. As Governor Rick Scott tirelessly worked to manage the crisis in his state, the media focused on a political point rather than the immediate needs of the affected population.\n\nThe Washington Post, in particular, published an article titled \"Florida Governor Has Refused to Recognize Climate-Change Risks, Critics Say,\" which drew criticism for its timing and focus. The article, published during the height of the crisis, highlighted Governor Scott's perceived lack of acknowledgment of climate change risks, while failing to seek comment from his office.\n\nThis incident has sparked a debate about the role of the media during a crisis, with some arguing that the media should focus on providing accurate and timely information rather than advancing political agendas. The Washington Post's article, for instance, was criticized for its one-sided approach, with no quotes from individuals who support Governor Scott's stance on climate change.\n\nThe debate about climate change and its role in hurricanes like Irma is complex and ongoing. While some scientists argue that global warming contributes to more intense hurricanes, others dispute this claim. The causes of hurricanes are influenced by a multitude of factors, and attributing any one event to global warming is a complex and nuanced issue.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, it is crucial to remember that the primary focus should be on providing aid and support to those affected by the storm. Governor Scott, for his part, has been praised for his leadership during the crisis, with many commending his tireless efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of his state's citizens.\n\nAs the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, it is essential to approach the issue with a balanced and nuanced perspective. The debate about climate change and its solutions should be based on facts, not political agendas. The media has a critical role to play in this debate, and it is important that they report accurately and fairly, especially during times of crisis.",
    " Title: Trump Sets Six-Month Deadline for Congress to Address DACA, Ending Obama-Era Program\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday that President Donald Trump has given Congress a six-month deadline to address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The president's decision means the DACA program, which grants work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, will come to an end after the six-month period.\n\nSessions stated that President Obama's creation of the DACA program was an \"unconstitutional exercise of authority\" as only Congress has the power to establish such policies. President Trump issued a statement saying, \"As President, my highest duty is to defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America. At the same time, I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are a nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\"\n\nBefore the announcement, Trump had hinted at his decision through a tweet on September 5, 2017, stating, \"Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!\"\n\nThe administration hopes that six months is enough time for Congress to come up with a legislative fix before the government stops renewing permits for people already covered by the program. Trump said, \"The legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws \u2013 this is the bedrock of our Constitutional system, which I took a solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend.\"\n\nThe DACA program, established in 2012, protects approximately 800,000 people from deportation, allowing them to work legally as long as they have the required work permit, which is renewable every two years. The president has been going back and forth for months over what to do about the program as Republican state officials have threatened to sue the administration if the president did not end the program.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday that Trump was in the process of finalizing his decision. \"He loves children and wants to make sure this decision is done correctly,\" she said. Trump has publicly wrestled with the decision since he took office, stating in February that the topic was \"a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have.\"\n\nMany people have protested ending the program due to its economic impact. According to a survey from the Center for American Progress, 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed. A survey respondent said, \"Because of DACA, I opened a restaurant. We are contributing to the economic growth of our local community. We pay our fair share of taxes and hire employees... It will be hard to maintain my business if DACA ended.\"\n\nSome members of President Trump's evangelical advisory board have asked him to protect the \"dreamers.\" The Washington Post reports that Atlanta pastor Jentzen Franklin and others pleaded with the president to preserve DACA last week in a meeting in the Oval Office. A White House official said they hope delaying the enforcement by six months will give Congress time to act on a broader solution for immigration reform.",
    " Title: Trump Endorses Paul Ryan, Signaling Potential Republican Unity Ahead of November Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, US presidential candidate Donald Trump has publicly endorsed House Speaker Paul Ryan, following a public spat between the two at the top of the Republican Party.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Trump announced his support for Mr. Ryan, stating, \"I support and endorse our Speaker... Paul Ryan.\" He emphasized the need for unity, saying, \"We need unity - we have to win this election.\"\n\nMr. Trump's endorsement comes after he refused to endorse Mr. Ryan and Senator John McCain in their campaigns for re-election in November, a move that shocked party members on Tuesday. The delay in endorsement was reciprocated, with Mr. Ryan himself long delaying his endorsement of Mr. Trump.\n\nIn addition to endorsing Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump also endorsed Sen. McCain and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In an earlier interview with the Washington Post, Mr. Trump had stated he was \"just not quite there yet\" when asked if he would endorse Mr. Ryan and Sen. McCain.\n\nThe endorsement comes after a series of public criticisms from both Mr. Ryan and Sen. McCain regarding Mr. Trump's attacks on the bereaved parents of a US Muslim soldier killed in Iraq. The soldier, Humayun Khan, was killed by a car bomb in 2004 at the age of 27.\n\nThis endorsement could signal a potential shift in the Republican Party, with both candidates agreeing on a lot despite their disagreements on a few issues, as per Mr. Trump's statement.\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter, in his analysis, suggests that Mr. Trump's continued popularity and financial backing could indicate a potential comeback story for the Republican candidate. Despite the recent spat, if Mr. Trump can maintain a more moderate tone and avoid controversial statements, the polls could narrow, according to Mr. Zurcher. The general election sprint is only just beginning, and there may still be peaks of resigned accommodation ahead.",
    " Title: Hollywood's Call for Unity at the 92nd Academy Awards Overshadowed by Political Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 92nd Academy Awards, held on Feb. 9, served as a platform for socially influential figures to encourage unity and camaraderie, a theme that was largely overlooked in media coverage. Instead, the focus was on political criticisms and the lavish \"swag bags\" given to attendees.\n\nTwo key award winners, Renee Zellweger and Joaquin Phoenix, used their acceptance speeches to emphasize the importance of inclusion, civility, and the fight against injustice.\n\nRenee Zellweger, who won the award for her role as Judy Garland in \"Judy,\" said, \"Our heroes unite us. When we look to our heroes, we agree, and that matters. Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, Dolores Huerta, Venus and Serena and Selena, Bob Dylan, Scorsese, Fred Rogers, Harriet Tubman... When we celebrate our heroes, we're reminded of who we are as one people united.\"\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, who won for his role in \"Joker,\" called for continued advocacy for the voiceless, stating, \"I've been thinking a lot about some of the distressing issues that we are facing collectively. I think, whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice.\"\n\nThe calls for unity, commonality, and the fight against injustice were largely ignored in headlines, with stories about political criticisms and the \"swag bags\" dominating the news. While Phoenix's calls for equality were the subject of a CNN entertainment piece, both his and Zellweger's speeches were satirically analyzed in an article from Vulture.\n\nAs political polarization continues to threaten our democracy, reminders of our commonalities are crucial. It's baffling that these calls for civility, made during one of the most star-studded events on the U.S. calendar, received little media attention.\n\nIn a time when the media often seems eager to acknowledge extreme polarization, it's disheartening that positive societal developments seem less newsworthy. However, in thinking and speaking inclusively before a national audience, powerful voices bought into the value of common ground. That's a positive message all Americans can get behind.\n\nWe want to hear from you: Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.",
    " Title: ASL Interpreted National Anthem Performance Highlights Awareness for Deaf Rights and Cultural Competency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold move to raise awareness for the deaf community and their systemic barriers, singer Demi Lovato took the stage at the Super Bowl LVI to perform the national anthem and \"America the Beautiful\" in American Sign Language (ASL). The performance, while not accessible to all viewers due to Fox's failure to provide live captioning, served as a powerful statement and a call to action for the deaf community and their allies.\n\nThe decision to perform in ASL was a personal choice for Lovato, who has a deaf sister. She hoped to provide a public service for deaf viewers and to highlight the systemic barriers and stigmas attached to deafness. This performance comes in the wake of incidents involving deaf individuals who have been mistreated or even killed by law enforcement, such as Robert Kim, Daniel Kevin Harris, Pearl Pearson, and Magdiel Sanchez.\n\nThese incidents are part of a larger pattern, as Amiel Fields-Meyer noted in a 2017 article for The Atlantic. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires the government to provide \"effective communication\" and \"reasonable accommodation,\" but gaps in cultural competency among law enforcement have led to strained and sometimes deadly interactions with the deaf community.\n\nThe deaf community faces numerous obstacles and injustices, including limited access to mental health services, healthcare, and sign language itself, inadequate online accessibility, lack of employment opportunities, and more. These inequalities disproportionately affect people of color.\n\nLovato's performance was not just a musical event, but a celebration of her language and a call for respect for all languages and identities. By learning to sign for her deaf sister and teaching her hearing child to sign, Lovato's parents demonstrated the importance of seeing and respecting the deaf community.\n\nThe National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has posted video of Lovato's entire performances on YouTube, allowing viewers to fully appreciate the significance of her message. The performances serve as a reminder of the importance of cultural competency, accessibility, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or identities.",

Bowe Bergdahl without Congress's consent persists, with many lawmakers questioning the legality of the swap. The latest development comes from the Senate Intelligence Committee, where two top members have accused the administration of violating the law by not informing Congress before the prisoner exchange.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss stated Tuesday that the administration broke the law by failing to address serious concerns they had about the deal to swap Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees. Chambliss revealed he had not had a conversation with the White House about a possible exchange for at least 18 months.\n\nFeinstein expressed her dismay following a closed-door meeting, stating, \"It comes to us with some surprise and dismay that the transfers went ahead with no consultation, totally not following the law.\" She added, \"In an issue with this kind of concern to a committee that bears the oversight responsibility, I think you can see that we're very dismayed about it.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who put the Blind Sheik in prison for his role in the first World Trade Center bombing, echoed these concerns on The Kelly File, expressing concerns about the rule of law not being followed. McCarthy, who has a new book out, has stated that this situation could be grounds for impeachment. Judge Andrew Napolitano agrees, stating that this is a \"very, very valid argument people are going to start talking about.\"\n\nAs the White House anticipated a wave of euphoria following the release of Bergdahl, they now face a significant challenge in addressing the allegations of lawbreaking and potential impeachment discussions.",
    " Title: US Government Shutdown Reaches Record 22 Days, Affecting Hundreds of Thousands of Federal Employees\n\nThe ongoing US government shutdown has surpassed its previous record, marking the longest shutdown in history at 22 days. The impasse between President Donald Trump and Congress over funding for a border wall shows no signs of resolution.\n\nAs of Saturday, approximately a quarter of the federal government remains shut down, leaving 800,000 employees unpaid. On Friday, these workers, including prison guards, airport staff, and FBI agents, missed their first salaries of the year.\n\nPresident Trump has maintained his stance, refusing to approve a budget without funding for a border wall on the Mexican border. He has, however, downplayed the possibility of declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and secure the necessary funds.\n\nIn response to the financial hardship, some federal employees have turned to social media, sharing blank payslips and listing their possessions for sale on Craigslist. A food bank in Washington D.C. is also providing assistance, arranging pop-up markets for affected workers.\n\nOf the 800,000 federal employees, about 350,000 are furloughed, while the remaining workers are continuing to work without pay. Thousands have reportedly applied for unemployment benefits due to the financial uncertainty.\n\nOne major airport, Miami International, will close an entire terminal this weekend due to a shortage of security agents caused by the shutdown. The agents, who are considered essential workers, are expected to work despite not receiving pay until the shutdown ends. However, many agents are reportedly calling in sick in protest of the situation.\n\nThe House and Senate have passed a bill ensuring all government workers receive retroactive pay once the shutdown ends. The president is expected to sign the legislation. However, this may provide little relief to those federal employees currently struggling financially with no end in sight to the impasse.\n\nAt a roundtable discussion about border security, Mr. Trump reiterated his demand for Democrats to approve funding for a wall or steel barrier. However, the Democratic leader of the US House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stated that the ball was in Mr. Trump's court.\n\nFor further information or to speak to a BBC journalist, please contact us via the following methods:\n\n[Contact Information]\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not express a political stance.",
    " Title: Obama's Middle East Policy Under Scrutiny: A Look at the Recent Violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of violent attacks in Israel, including the murder of an American and his Israeli wife, the Obama administration's Middle East policy has come under scrutiny. The violence, which has been met with a mix of condemnation and moral equivalence from the White House, has left many questioning the effectiveness of the current approach.\n\nThis week, Israel was struck by a wave of stabbings and shootings, with one particularly heinous incident involving the murder of an American and his Israeli wife, and their four children, aged 9, 7, 4, and 4 months, watching in terror as their parents were brutally killed. The perpetrators, Palestinian gunmen, fled the scene, leaving the traumatized children to deal with the aftermath of the unspeakable cruelty.\n\nThe Palestinian response to the slaying was one of celebration, with Palestinian newspapers describing the gunmen's actions as \"heroic.\" Photographs of the gruesome crime were shared on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In Washington, the U.S. government expressed \"growing concern\" over the violence and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.\n\nHowever, the State Department's response was met with criticism for its perceived moral equivalence, with the statement condemning \"violence against Israeli and Palestinian civilians\" and calling for all parties to \"refrain from actions and rhetoric that would further escalate tensions.\" The statement was widely interpreted as placing the blame on Israel for the violence.\n\nIsraeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, called out the Obama administration for its perceived bias towards Israel. Netanyahu pointed out that Iran, which is guaranteed by the Iran nuclear deal to obtain a nuclear bomb, continues to threaten the Jewish state with annihilation. The speech was met with silence from the General Assembly audience, with no applause or even a rumble of applause.\n\nThe Obama administration has been criticized for its handling of the Middle East, with many accusing the president of not liking Jews and scorning Israelis. However, the administration has dismissed these accusations as canard.\n\nThe violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Obama administration's Middle East policy and the future of the region. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the administration will take a more decisive approach to addressing the ongoing violence and instability in the region.",
    " Title: Veteran Lawyer Emmet Jopling Bondurant II Argues Redistricting Case Before Supreme Court 55 Years After Landmark Voting Rights Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty-five years after his first appearance before the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case, Emmet Jopling Bondurant II, a veteran lawyer, is set to argue before the high court again in a case that asks whether politicians can draw political boundaries to benefit their own political party at the expense of the other party.\n\nBondurant, an 82-year-old lawyer, was a student at the University of Georgia in the 1950s, but he did not join the civil rights movement. \"I was trying to get through college,\" he said in an interview. \"And I'm embarrassed to say I was not involved. I should have been involved much sooner.\"\n\nHowever, as a 26-year-old lawyer, Bondurant soon took part in one of the most important voting rights cases before the Supreme Court in the 1960s\u2014Wesberry v. Sanders\u2014which ultimately required states to put equal numbers of people in congressional districts.\n\nIn the 1960s, urban populations had grown significantly, but politicians were not adjusting the districts, according to historian Doug Smith, author of On Democracy's Doorstep: The Inside Story Of How The Supreme Court Brought \"One Person, One Vote\" To The United States. \"I can't imagine any state legislature just forgetting\u2014not getting around to redistricting\u2014I think it was absolutely a political choice,\" said Smith.\n\nIn Michigan, for example, about 800,000 people lived in the largest district, which included Detroit. Just over 117,000 people lived in the smallest district. Yet both districts each elected one member to the House of Representatives, giving the voters in the smaller district far more sway than in the larger one.\n\nIn states where people of color could vote, malapportioned districts tended to give them less political power, and it generally gave Congress and state legislatures a rural bias, said Smith. \"You had a rural minority that was able to pass labor laws that were not favorable to workers in the cities,\" said Smith.\n\nBondurant compares the practice at that time to partisan redistricting, also called gerrymandering, today. \"They did not want the districts changed. They did not want new competition. They did not want new voters. They wanted the old voters they already had. And that is one form of gerrymandering,\" said Bondurant.\n\nIn this week's case before the Supreme Court, Bondurant is set to argue for the side asking the court to block the practice, and he brings some special experience to the topic. After Bondurant joined a law firm in Atlanta, he was recruited by a group of older lawyers to work on Wesberry v. Sanders, about the imbalance between congressional districts.\n\nBondurant spent his nights and weekends working on the case for free. The only break was for home football games at the University of Georgia. \"That was understood to be a religious holiday of sorts,\" he said. The work was especially time-consuming because of the data involved. \"You were working with the 1960 Census, and a legal pad, and a pencil,\" Bondurant said. \"And if you made a mistake in one area, it affected everything you'd done, like a series of dominos.\"\n\nOn November 18, 1963, Bondurant argued before the Supreme Court for the first time. He was 26. Chief Justice Earl Warren mispronounced Bondurant's name at the beginning of the hearing, but the young lawyer seemed unphased, and delivered his arguments.\n\nBondurant has won plenty of big corporate cases. But he says even people with few resources should have someone to speak for their interests, whether in Congress or the courts. In the 1990s, Bondurant helped secure the exoneration of Gary Nelson, who spent about a decade on death row. In the 1980s, Bondurant risked his reputation arguing for an Atlanta woman in a gender bias case. And Bondurant has backed small civil rights groups like the Asian American Legal Advocacy Center in Atlanta, founded by Helen Kim Ho.\n\n\"Ultimately the work and the fight was ours, but he stepped in at a critical time,\" Kim Ho said. \"And we're grateful for it.\" Around the 2012 election, Kim Ho's group was registering new citizens to vote. It got an intimidating letter from Georgia's secretary of state. She contacted Bondurant, and when he let the state know he was involved, it backed off. Kim Ho sees it as a great example of how Bondurant is an ally to people of color. \"What you want is a lawyer who is angry, and willing to be a bulldog for you,\" she said.\n\nIn 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bondurant's side. In states with more than one House representative, districts must have the same population. The ruling gave more power to urban and suburban areas, and it forced politicians to get more creative about how they draw districts, said Doug Smith, the historian. \"It's at that point then when the drive toward gerrymandering really starts to kick up to another notch,\" Smith said.\n\nFifty-five years later, Bondurant is set to argue before the Supreme Court again. This time he's asking the court to block partisan redistricting in North Carolina. Although the state is closely politically divided, the legislature ensured that Republicans would dominate the congressional delegation. Bondurant has no plans to retire, or quit trying to improve democracy in the country through the courts. \"I'd rather spend my time doing that than playing golf, in part because I play golf so badly that the opportunity not to play is itself a positive,\" Bondurant said. \"But, this is really important stuff, and it's very fundamental.\"",
    " Title: Colorado House Passes Limits on Ammunition Magazine Size and Universal Background Checks in Emotional Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a second day of intense debates, the Colorado House has passed bills imposing limits on the size of ammunition magazines and implementing universal background checks for all gun purchases. The Democratic-controlled House, facing strong opposition from Republicans, passed the bills amidst close votes, with some Democrats joining the Republicans in voting no.\n\nThe ammunition restrictions limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms and eight for shotguns. The bill passed 34-31, with three Democrats joining all Republicans in voting against the proposal.\n\nRepresentative Rhonda Fields, a Democratic sponsor of the bill and representative of the district where the shootings at an Aurora theater occurred last summer, stated, \"Enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of bloodshed.\" Fields' son was also fatally shot in 2005.\n\nRepublicans argued that the proposals infringe upon Second Amendment rights and would not prevent mass shootings like those in Aurora and a Connecticut elementary school. Republican Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg stated, \"This bill will never keep evil people from doing evil things.\"\n\nThe House also approved a bill requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including those between private sellers and firearms bought online. Other proposals would ban concealed firearms at colleges and stadiums, and another requires that gun purchasers pay for their own background checks.\n\nThe closest vote was on the background check measure, which passed 33-32. Democratic Rep. Ed Vigil, who represents rural southern Colorado, voted against the four bills, citing the state's rugged history.\n\nDespite a few Democrats joining Republicans in voting no for the bills, the Democrats' 37-28 advantage in the House gave them enough leeway. The Senate still needs to consider the proposals, and Democrats will need to be more unified in their support there due to their 20-15 advantage.\n\nHouse lawmakers began debating the bills on Friday, with debates lasting 12 hours before giving initial approval to the bills. During the debate, Vice President Joe Biden called four Democrats, including two in moderate districts, to solidify support for the measures.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dominick Moreno, who represents a district in suburban Denver, was among the four lawmakers. He said Biden \"emphasized the importance of Colorado's role in shaping national policy around this issue.\"\n\nCastle Rock Republican Rep. Carole Murray brought up Biden's calls during Monday's debate, stating she did not appreciate \"East-coast politicians\" trying to influence Colorado legislators.\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Hickenlooper supports the expanded background checks and thinks gun buyers should pay for them. He also said he may support limits on the size of magazines, if lawmakers agree to a number between 15 and 20. He has not decided whether to support banning concealed firearms on campuses and stadiums.\n\nRepublicans argue that students should have the right to defend themselves. Republican Rep. Jim Wilson said, \"Do not disarm our young adults in general and our young women in particular on our college campuses in the name of a gun-free zone.\"\n\nThe gun debate highlights a fundamental philosophical difference between many Democrats and Republicans. Democratic House Leader Dickey Lee Hullinghorst stated, \"I resent the implication that unless we all arm ourselves, we will not be adequately protected.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Christ Holbert became emotional while explaining his opposition to the bills. He said he understood Rep. Rhonda Fields' passion for the bills, given her district and her son's shooting in 2005.\n\n\"But I care passionately about the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, and the oath that we have taken,\" Holbert said.",
    " Title: Biden Leads Trump in 'Dislike Both' Voters, Polls Show\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing battle for the presidency, presumed Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden is emerging as the preferred choice among voters who view both him and President Donald Trump unfavorably. This dynamic was not as pronounced in 2016, when Trump was the fallback option for many voters who were not enthused about either him or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Mike Noble of the public opinion and market research analytics firm OH Predictive Insights, the former vice president's ability to attract working-class voters is a key factor in his electability argument. Exit polls in 2016 found that roughly 20% of voters in crucial states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin did not have a favorable view of their presidential options. Biden outperformed Clinton among these disillusioned voters by significant margins in these states, contributing to Trump's slim victories.\n\nSurveys from Monmouth University show that the share of voters who do not have high opinions of either Trump or Biden has been consistently around 20% since March. However, the most recent poll showed Biden leading Trump among this group by a 59% to 17% margin.\n\nPatrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, notes a shift in the composition of the 'dislike both' group. In 2016, these voters were evenly split between those leaning Democratic and those leaning Republican, 42% to 40%, respectively. This year, an overwhelming 51% of 'dislike both' voters lean Democratic, while 21% lean Republican.\n\nAnother difference between the two election cycles is that the pool of 'dislike both' voters has shrunk, according to Murray. He attributes this to either Trump's ability to win over more voters or Republican voters no longer identifying as such.\n\nA Morning Consult poll of 27,754 registered voters released this month found Biden leading Trump by 45% to 42%. Among voters with unfavorable views of both candidates, Biden held a 46% to 14% lead.\n\nA recent OH Predictive Insights poll in Arizona, a state Democrats have not won since 1996, showed a similar trend. The survey found Biden with a 50% to 43% edge over Trump among likely voters, and a significant lead among voters who think their choices are unappealing.\n\n\"The gap in their support is striking,\" said Noble in his analysis, noting the small sample size. \"More than six in ten (63%) of these voters say they would vote for Joe Biden, whereas only 6% say they would vote for Donald Trump.\"",
    " Title: Coordinated Disruptions and Obstruction Tactics Mark Democratic Strategy in Kavanaugh Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday has been marked by a series of disruptions and obstruction tactics orchestrated by Democratic senators, aiming to delay the Supreme Court nomination process amid complaints about access to documents.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kavanaugh delivered his opening statement, vowing to be a \"neutral and impartial arbiter\" after enduring a day of intense criticism from Democrats. The Democrats, in response, repeatedly objected, delayed, and even attempted to adjourn the hearing, requesting more documents and time to review the files they had.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., seemed to acknowledge the coordinated nature of the disruptions when asked by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis during Tuesday's hearing about reports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a phone call over the holiday weekend discussing protest plans.\n\nDurbin said, \"There was a phone conference yesterday,\" where \"many issues were raised.\" He cited concerns that \"over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh had been characterized by the chairman of the committee as committee confidential\" and questions of whether the committee should hear the nominee \"without access to basic information about his public record.\"\n\nAccording to Politico, citing unnamed sources, Democrats considered staging a mass walkout during the confirmation hearing. However, the party's top lawmakers ultimately decided against such a move, fearing the backlash from a made-for-TV moment would only help the Republican Party and impede any chances to stop the nomination of Kavanaugh.\n\nThe consideration of such a drastic move revealed a split between the party's more liberal wing, who wish to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh by all means necessary, and more senior Democrats, who believe the nomination should be defeated only by following rules and norms.\n\nYounger Democrats, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, led the disruptions on Tuesday, urging the committee to delay the hearing amid protests by liberal activists, some of whom were arrested. Harris received praise for her defiance of the chamber's norms.\n\nBy not staging a walkout, however, Democrats allowed themselves to become part of the process and grill Kavanaugh in the upcoming hearings, hoping to mobilize opposition to his candidacy.\n\nThe obstructionist tactics, which will likely boost some lawmakers' reputations among the increasingly liberal base, may still backfire when it comes to the confirmation of Kavanaugh. Democrats ultimately need to convince moderate Republicans to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the swing votes that could stop the nomination, dismissed Tuesday's protests as \"a lot of drama,\" according to the outlet.\n\nAnother notable moment from Tuesday's hearing was when Fred Guttenberg, father of Jaime Guttenberg who was killed in the Parkland shooting, approached Kavanaugh for a handshake, only for the nominee to walk away. The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, invited Guttenberg to sit in the audience, stating, \"He knows firsthand how Brett Kavanaugh's extreme views on guns could lead to more massacres.\"\n\nHowever, Guttenberg said it was his decision to approach Kavanaugh, stating, \"I initiated an effort to introduce myself to Kavanaugh. It was my decision, and I own it.\" Anyone trying to come up with some political master plan is simply wrong.\"",
    " Title: Who Lost Egypt? A Retrospective on U.S. Relations and the Arab Spring\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of reports suggesting a significant reduction in U.S. aid to Egypt, a question has arisen concerning the state of American relations with one of the Middle East's most significant countries: Who lost Egypt?\n\nThe answer can be traced back to June 4, 2009, with President Obama's speech, \"A New Beginning,\" at Cairo University, where he outlined his vision for U.S. relations in the Middle East, just a few months after his first inauguration.\n\n\"I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed, confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice,\" Mr. Obama told the audience.\n\nMany in the Arab world took the president at his word. However, the promises turned out to be rather hollow.\n\n\"Contradictory diplomatic and military messages suggest how enfeebled the U.S. has become in dealing with one of its closest allies in the Middle East,\" wrote Jonathan Guyer, a senior editor of the Cairo Review of Global Affairs, this week. \"In fact, Washington does not even know what it expects from Cairo.\"\n\nThe Western journalistic community that embraced the 2011 demonstrations against undemocratic and corrupt governments throughout the Arab world, including Egypt, often played the role of cheerleaders, failing to understand how autocratic forces like the Muslim Brotherhood hijacked the political process.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that the term \"Arab Spring\" is abhorrent to many Egyptians and almost everyone who knows much about the country\u2014one of the many erroneous reporting memes from Western journalists. For one thing, three seasons\u2014which don't include spring\u2014exist in Egypt: the flooding of the Nile (roughly June through September), the growing of crops (roughly October through February), and the harvest that lasts from March through May.\n\nThe term \"Arab Spring\"\u2014apparently used first by the Christian Science Monitor and Foreign Policy\u2014irked Arab writers like Rami Khouri of the Beirut-based Daily Star. He noted that the protesters themselves preferred the words revolution, or \"thawra\" in Arabic, and awakening, or \"sahwa.\"\n\nThe term \"Arab Spring\" also rings hollow because it can refer to the failed Prague Spring of 1968, which Russian troops put down brutally, or the Spring of Nations in Europe of 1848, which also arguably resulted in little change.\n\nDuring Egypt's election campaign, many journalists and the Obama team failed to understand the Muslim Brotherhood, a group many reporters described as \"moderate,\" a term I rejected from the outset. Mohammed Morsi, the head of a party backed by the Brotherhood, won roughly 25 percent of the votes in the first round of the elections in late May 2012. In a runoff election against a discredited crony of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Ahmed Shafik, Mr. Morsi won 51.7 percent of the vote to 48.3 for Mr. Shafik. That's hardly a resounding endorsement.\n\nWithin months, Mr. Morsi essentially had declared himself the supreme ruler of the country and led Egypt through the arrest and torture of opponents, along with the collapse of the economy that left many people without food.\n\nWestern journalists and the Obama team described the Muslim Brotherhood as the democratically elected government. After 14 million Egyptians protested against the Brotherhood, the military took over, albeit with a heavy hand that I abhor. Nevertheless, the reduction in foreign aid to Egypt is likely to make relations significantly worse rather than bringing about democratic change\u2014if that is the administration's intention.\n\nWho lost Egypt? The Obama administration has made numerous errors, while Western journalists have played a significant role in losing one of our most important allies.\n\nChristopher Harper is a professor at Temple University.

    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Expanded Social Media Screening for Visa Applicants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has unveiled a proposal that aims to collect the social media history of nearly all visa applicants seeking entry into the United States. The State Department, which has put forth the proposal, requires most visa applicants to disclose their Facebook and Twitter accounts used in the past five years.\n\nThe proposal, which affects approximately 14.7 million people annually, also requests five years of telephone numbers, email addresses, and travel history. Applicants will be asked if they have ever been deported from a country or if any relatives have been involved in terrorist activities.\n\nThe proposal does not apply to citizens from countries that the US grants visa-free travel status, such as the UK, Canada, France, and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China, and Mexico could be affected if they visit the US for work or leisure.\n\nOfficials have defended the proposal, stating that it would help identify potential extremists. The move comes in response to the 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, where 14 people were killed. Authorities claimed they missed signs of radicalization in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers.\n\nUnder rules implemented last May, officials were instructed to seek social media handles only if they felt that such information was necessary to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting.\n\nThe tougher proposal follows President Trump's promise to implement \"extreme vetting\" for foreigners entering the US, aimed at combating terrorism.\n\n\"Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,\" the State Department said in a statement, as reported by the New York Times. \"We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.\"\n\nThe proposal is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget, and the public will have two months to comment before a decision is made.\n\nCivil liberties groups have criticized the policy as a privacy invasion that could infringe upon free speech.\n\n\"People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,\" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and YouTube. The New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included.",
    " Title: Legal Expert Warns of \"Dangerous\" Impeachment Process as House Judiciary Committee Holds First Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated hearing on Wednesday, legal expert Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, testified that the current legal case for impeaching President Donald Trump is \"woefully inadequate\" and \"dangerous.\" The House Judiciary Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry, is investigating Trump's actions regarding a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTurley, in his opening statement, expressed concern about the \"integrity\" of the impeachment process based on the case being built against Trump. He stated, \"One can oppose President Trump\u2019s policies or actions but still conclude that the current legal case for impeachment is not just woefully inadequate, but in some respects, dangerous, as the basis for the impeachment of an American president.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which began in September, centers on Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump pressed for investigations that could help him politically, including those related to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Turley argued that while Trump's comments about Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma are worthy of criticism, they do not constitute a case of bribery.\n\nTurley, a Republican witness, testified alongside three other legal scholars, all of whom are witnesses for the Democrats. The hearing is expected to set the stage for the next phase of the House impeachment inquiry into the president. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has announced that the hearing will weigh whether the president's actions reach a level of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" and warrant articles of impeachment.\n\nThe hearing is slated to follow a similar format to the House Intelligence Committee's public hearings last month, with Democrats and Republicans given equal time to present their arguments. The president and his counsel declined Nadler's invitation to participate in the hearing.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was prompted by a whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's phone call with Zelensky. Trump has challenged the accuracy of the complaint, though the transcript released by the White House did support the core allegations that he pressed for politically related investigations.\n\nThis week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., transmitted a report with the majority's findings from their inquiry, which concluded that Trump withheld nearly $391 million in military aid from Ukraine, conditioning its delivery as well as a White House visit for Zelensky on a public announcement that he was conducting investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden's, business dealings in Ukraine, as well as issues related to the 2016 election. The Democrats' report also accuses Trump of committing obstruction by instructing witnesses not to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee drafted a report of their own, which rejected Democrats' claims, stating there is no evidence for impeachment.",

At a joint news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump stated, \"As the UK makes preparations to exit the European Union, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the US and the UK.\"\n\nTrump suggested that the two countries could conduct two to three times the amount of trade they currently do. May, who is stepping down as head of her Conservative Party this week, has been criticized for her handling of Brexit. The new prime minister will be responsible for achieving Brexit and any bilateral trade deal with the U.S.\n\nTrump praised both Boris Johnson, who has advocated for a no-deal Brexit, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign minister who has warned against leaving without a deal. When asked about the Huawei issue, Trump said he would work out any differences with the U.K., emphasizing the strong intelligence relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe Trump administration has expressed concerns about Huawei's role in 5G networks, fearing it could allow China to spy on sensitive communications and data. Huawei denies these allegations.\n\nTrump's state visit, initially promised in January 2017, is intended to celebrate the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K., boost trade links, and reaffirm security cooperation. Trump praised Queen Elizabeth as a \"fantastic woman\" and thanked Britain for the visit.\n\nMay praised the \"precious and profound\" alliance between the two countries but acknowledged that friends could also disagree, as they do on issues like the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement. The U.K. still supports the Iran nuclear agreement, but the U.S. has withdrawn from it. May also emphasized the importance of cooperation and compromise in strong alliances.",
    " Title: The Decline of Anti-Trump Media Outlets: A Case Study of The Weekly Standard and Its Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of media, the strategy of relentlessly attacking President Donald Trump has proven to be a questionable business move for numerous outlets. This is evident in the reported impending dissolution of The Weekly Standard, a 28-year-old neoconservative institution, founded by Bill Kristol.\n\nThe Weekly Standard's focus on attacking the President and his supporters for nearly three years has reportedly led to its potential demise. This trend is not limited to Kristol; other outlets that cater to the liberal base, such as Vice, Vox, Mic, Buzzfeed, and Mashable, are either seeking buyers or reevaluating their strategies in a bid to become profitable. Mic, for instance, has laid off most of its staff, while Vice and Vox are reportedly shedding employees.\n\nCable news networks have not been immune to this trend. One network, in particular, CNN, has abandoned decades of journalistic tradition and ethics, dedicating its resources to a relentless, nakedly partisan crusade against President Trump. CNN's ratings have suffered as a result, with the network falling behind both the Hallmark Channel and Home and Garden Television in October.\n\nThe \"resistance\" media strategy, while fervently pursued by many outlets, seems to be not only corrosive to the country but also a losing business model. The possible end of The Weekly Standard, under Kristol's leadership, serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon.\n\nKristol, a neocon hero during the George W. Bush administration, saw The Weekly Standard as a significant conservative outlet, read by serious people making serious policy decisions. However, the 2016 campaign marked a turning point for Kristol and The Weekly Standard. Despite most of the Republican Party uniting behind Donald Trump, Kristol remained steadfast in his opposition.\n\nDespite promising a major, serious third-party candidate to defeat both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Kristol put forward a politically obscure friend, an embarrassing move for both him and the magazine. As President Trump delivered victory after victory on issues Kristol long claimed to care about, Kristol's relentless anti-Trump crusade appeared increasingly ego-driven, then obsessive, and finally farcical.\n\nKristol's attempts to primary pro-Trump Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz with a Never Trump challenger ended in another lopsided defeat. Undeterred, Kristol continued to lead a campaign to unseat President Trump in 2020, even publishing a campaign announcement speech for a fantasy Never Trump savior. However, his efforts garnered little interest beyond the Trump-hating left.\n\nUnmoored from reality, Kristol continues to threaten Trump, prophesying that \"the Trump presidency crumbles\" in the face of his 2020 primary challenge. What is actually crumbling are Kristol's reputation and legacy. Fortunately, it appears that the bulk of the late Standard's funding will be reassigned to its thus far fair-to-Trump sister publication, The Washington Examiner.\n\nIt seems that building resistance credentials by demonizing President Trump is not only detrimental to journalism but also harmful to business. Jeff Ballabon, CEO of B2 Strategic, a political advisor, media consultant, and former CBS executive, offers this insight.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Steers Debate Discourse Toward Foreign Policy, Advocates for Iran Nuclear Deal and Peaceful Resolution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the left-leaning rhetoric of her fellow Democratic candidates during the first debate, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) focused on the issue of foreign policy, advocating for the United States to avoid war, particularly in relation to Iran.\n\nWhen asked about rejoining the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Gabbard, a veteran of the Iraq War, expressed her support for re-entering the agreement, cautioning against the potential catastrophic consequences of war. \"War with Iran would be worse than war with Iraq,\" she stated. \"Donald Trump and his hawkish cabinet, including Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others, are creating a situation where a spark could ignite a war with Iran. Trump needs to get back into the Iran deal, swallow his pride, and put America first.\"\n\nGabbard's stance contrasted with the positions of other candidates on stage. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) was the only participant to suggest that he would not automatically re-enter the Iran deal, implying a better deal could be negotiated. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) expressed her support for reentering the deal but advocated for stricter terms. Klobuchar also emphasized that any war with Iran would require congressional authorization.\n\nThroughout the debate, Gabbard maintained a focus on the U.S.'s aggressive foreign policy, declining to answer a question about the gender pay gap in favor of criticizing current interventionist foreign policy. Later in the debate, when Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) referenced the recent deaths of two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan as a reason to continue the war, Gabbard responded emphatically. \"Will you tell the parents of those two soldiers that were killed in Afghanistan that we have to be engaged? That is unacceptable. We have lost so many lives, we have spent so much money,\" she said.\n\nGabbard's single-minded focus on war and peace has been a defining characteristic of her longshot campaign since its inception. \"There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace,\" she said when announcing her intention to run to CNN's Van Jones.\n\nWhile Gabbard's focus on foreign policy may not win her many votes, given the predominance of domestic policy in the debate and the primary as a whole, her willingness to prioritize peace and avoid a softball question about women's wages was a refreshing moment amidst the otherwise left-leaning rhetoric from the rest of the Democratic field on stage tonight.",
    " Title: Lame-Duck Speaker John Boehner Clears the Path for Successor with Budget and Debt Ceiling Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to \"clear the barn\" before his impending departure, outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, has brokered a deal on two contentious issues: raising the debt ceiling by next Tuesday and reaching a budget agreement.\n\nThe 144-page budget resolution, submitted to the House Rules Committee late Tuesday, increases federal spending by $80 billion over the next two years, with half of that increase allocated to defense and the other half to domestic programs. The agreement also includes cuts to Medicare and Social Security disability benefits, and lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017.\n\nRep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., expressed support for the deal, stating, \"This is one of those moments when it's important that leadership step in and take the ball and run with it.\"\n\nHowever, the deal's swift approval has been met with criticism from hard-line conservatives who feel excluded from the negotiations. The agreement was reportedly reached in talks involving only five parties: the top two Republicans in Congress, the top two Democrats, and the White House.\n\nRep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., voiced his disapproval, stating, \"This is what we've been going through for five years, where the leadership team negotiate a deal without speaking to any members of the [Republican] conference\u2014apparently not even the committee chairmen who are in key positions\u2014and then expect all of us to vote for it.\"\n\nWhile Boehner hopes this move will ease his successor's job, some members of the Republican caucus argue that his presumptive heir, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, should have been involved in the negotiations. However, Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, believes Ryan's absence from the deal may work to his advantage.\n\n\"I think this somewhat insulates Paul [Ryan],\" said Flores. \"But I still believe if there's somebody that does not like this and they're passionate about it, that they'll take out their feelings on Paul.\"\n\nThe House could vote on this budget agreement as early as Wednesday, the same day Republicans are expected to officially nominate Ryan as the next speaker.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Campaign in Swing States, Addressing Key Issues Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final 13 days before the Nov. 6 election, both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have intensified their campaign efforts, visiting key swing states Iowa and Nevada to rally supporters and address critical issues.\n\nAt rallies in Davenport, Iowa, and Denver, Colorado, President Obama employed his recent attack lines against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, including the term \"Romnesia\" to highlight his opponent's apparent inconsistencies in his political positions.\n\nObama stated, \"I want to go over the symptoms with you, Davenport, because I don't want you to catch it. I do not want it to spread. If you say you won't give a big tax cut to the wealthy but you're caught on video promising your tax cut would include the top 1 percent, then you might have 'Romnesia.' If you talk about how much you love teachers during a debate, but just a few weeks ago you said we should not hire anymore teachers because they won't grow the economy, you probably have 'Romnesia.'\"\n\nIn Reno, Nevada, a state heavily impacted by the housing market collapse, Romney emphasized his economic argument for why he should be elected president over Obama.\n\n\"I was just a few days ago speaking with a man... He said that the job he used to have was at $25 an hour plus benefits. But the job he has now is $9 an hour without benefits. And he said, you know, I'm showing up on the employment rolls, but my life has changed dramatically,\" Romney said. \"We've seen this across the entire country, and that's in part because the president does not understand what it takes to get this economy going. He does not have a plan to get jobs for Americans.\"\n\nAccording to recent polls, Obama has consistently led Romney in Nevada, though his lead has been within the margin of error. Similarly, several Iowa polls have given the president a slight lead or show the race as tied.\n\nBoth candidates have a busy schedule ahead, with Obama planning to visit Burbank, California, for a taping of the Tonight show with Jay Leno and a stop in Nevada, while Romney is scheduled to visit Iowa and Cleveland, Ohio, with his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, delivering a speech on upward mobility.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama campaign has faced minor controversy after changing their minds and releasing a transcript of Obama's interview with Des Moines Register executives, which was initially intended to be off-the-record. The Romney campaign has faced a larger issue with Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's comment that pregnancies caused by rapes are \"intended\" by God. Romney's campaign has distanced itself from Mourdock's statement, but there have been calls for the Republican nominee to take further action due to his appearance in an ad endorsing Mourdock.\n\nFinally, reality show star and real-estate developer Donald Trump offered $5 million to the charity of Obama's choice if the president releases his college transcript and U.S. passport, a request that the White House and Obama campaign have declined.",
    " Title: Al Smith Dinner: A Night of Friendly Roast Turns into a Tense Exchange for Clinton and Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to lighten the political tension, the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, traditionally a time for presidential candidates to offer self-deprecating humor, was held on Thursday. However, the event, now in its 71st year, seemed to fall short of its intended purpose as the candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, entered from separate sides of the room and did not shake hands.\n\nTrump, who spoke first, delivered a speech that was at times difficult to discern as a joke. He joked about the politicians who had once loved him, his wealth, and his endorsements before he decided to run for president. \"Suddenly, [they] decided when I ran for president as a Republican that I've always been a no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel. And they totally forgot about me,\" Trump said, to silence from the crowd.\n\nOne of Trump's jokes that resonated was his crack about Clinton's ongoing email server saga. \"And even tonight, with all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil with each other. In fact, just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, 'Pardon me.'\"\n\nTrump also joked about calling Clinton a \"nasty woman\" at their final debate in Las Vegas. \"But this stuff is all relative,\" he said. \"After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I do not think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore,\" another famous woman he has previously disparaged.\n\nHowever, things took a turn when Trump called Clinton corrupt several times, and not in a joking manner. \"Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,\" a remark that drew boos.\n\nClinton, as she is known to do, smiled throughout. But when it was her turn, she also let her opponent have it, ribbing him over his recent allegations that the election might be rigged, and that he may not accept the results of the vote. \"It's amazing I'm up here after Donald,\" Clinton said. \"I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.\"\n\nShe mocked Trump for talking over her during the debates. She mocked Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, for defending Trump to no end, saying she'd enjoy listening to Trump's VP pick denying Trump ever gave his Al Smith Dinner speech. She mocked Trump on the way he talks about women's looks, saying he'd rank the Statue of Liberty \"a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\"\n\nThe Clinton line that drew the most laughs might have been her take on Trump's debate performance and the drama he provided before it even started. \"Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind,\" Clinton said. \"Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate.... I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer. Now, actually, I did. It's called preparation.\"\n\nAfter pausing for laughter, Clinton added, \"And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates, and he says I do not have any stamina!\"\n\nOne needed much stamina to endure the night's sometimes cringe-worthy moments. Though Trump provided almost all of them, Clinton's more traditional speech could not lift the awkward mood of the event. If the Al Smith Dinner in previous years has served as a respite from bitter campaign seasons, this year it may have failed to do so.\n\nThere was at least one bright spot, though. Before the event was done, Clinton and Trump did shake hands. The development was announced from the stage, to applause.",
    " Title: Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski Criticize Mitch McConnell's Coordination with White House on Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have joined the growing chorus of criticism against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his assertion that he is in \"total coordination\" with the White House on the ongoing impeachment trial.\n\nIn an interview with Maine Public Radio, Sen. Collins expressed her disapproval of senators on both sides of the aisle who she believes are prejudging the evidence before hearing the presentation. She specifically named McConnell and Sen. Elizabeth Warren for their comments that have been perceived as biased.\n\n\"It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because the each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously to render impartial justice,\" Collins said. \"And I have heard Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, saying that the President should be impeached, found guilty, and removed from office. I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House. There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging that's in an impartial way.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Murkowski expressed her disapproval of McConnell's comments on coordinating strategy with the White House. \"When I heard that, I was disturbed,\" Murkowski told KTUU last week. \"We have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense, and so I heard what leader McConnell had said, I happened to think that that has further confused the process.\"\n\nCollins also stated that she is \"open\" to calling witnesses in the trial, although she said it would be \"premature to decide who should be called\" until the evidence is presented. Democrats have stepped up their call for witnesses after a New York Times report detailing how Trump's order to put a hold on Ukraine aid was handled within the White House.\n\n\"Simply put: In our fight to have key documents and witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial, these new revelations are a game-changer,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference on Monday. McConnell has maintained that the trial should not include witnesses.",
    " Title: Protesters Call for Regulation of Self-Defense Rights: A Look at the Debate on Individual Liberties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of protests across the country, students, teachers, and other Americans are voicing their opinions on the issue of self-defense rights. While some may interpret these demonstrations as a call for limits on the right to free assembly, the protesters are, in fact, advocating for greater regulation of self-defense rights.\n\nThe protesters, exercising their own right to free speech, are engaging in a debate that has been a subject of contention for many years. The exercise of individual rights, according to the protesters and many libertarians and classical liberals, should not be subject to popular opinion or debate. They argue that individuals are sovereign beings free to do as they please, so long as they do not cause harm to others.\n\nThe protesters' call for regulation of self-defense rights is a response to the ongoing debate about gun control in the United States. While some argue for stricter gun laws to prevent gun-related violence, others maintain that such restrictions infringe upon their right to self-defense.\n\nThe protesters' actions have sparked a conversation about the limits of government intervention in individual lives. Some argue that the government's role is to prevent harm to others, while others believe that the potential for causing harm is inherent in the exercise of liberty and should not be a basis for government action.\n\nIt is important to note that the protesters' call for regulation does not necessarily mean that those who value self-defense rights will change their conduct if their demands are met. The enforcement of laws is ultimately dependent on the willingness of individuals to abide by them. History has shown that people are willing to disobey laws they find restrictive or oppressive, and this has been the case with gun laws in the United States and other countries.\n\nThe protesters' call for regulation of self-defense rights is a reflection of the ongoing debate about individual liberties and the role of government in regulating those liberties. While the protesters have the right to voice their opinions, it is important to recognize that their demands may not be met by those who value self-defense rights and the principles of individual sovereignty. The debate is likely to continue, and the outcome will depend on the will of the people and the balance of power between individual liberties and government regulation.",
    " Title: China Rolls Out the Red Carpet for Trump as U.S.-China Ties Remain Complex\n\nArticle:\n\nBEIJING ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - As U.S. President Donald Trump embarks on a 12-day trip to Asia, China is preparing to welcome him with a lavish state visit, following their meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April. The \"bromance\" between the two leaders is set to continue, despite political turmoil in the U.S. and growing power for Xi Jinping in China.\n\nChinese experts say Beijing has learned to manage Trump, a real-estate mogul who had never held elective office before becoming president. Trump's administration in its first 10 months has been turbulent, but China has an \"objective view\" of him, according to Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University.\n\nIn a congratulatory phone call, Trump hailed the \"extraordinary elevation\" of Xi, whose political thoughts were enshrined in the Communist Party's constitution last month during a congress marking the start of his second term. Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump cited record stock market levels, low unemployment, and Islamic State \"virtually defeated in the Middle East\" as evidence of his own success.\n\nTrade remains an irritant in U.S.-China relations, but Trump has put aside grievances about China's trade and currency practices to get China behind his strategy of punishing sanctions on North Korea for its escalating missile and nuclear tests. China has responded by shutting down North Korean companies operating within its borders, banning exports of textiles, and reducing oil exports to the North.\n\nTrump's visit to China will give him a chance to reassure friends and allies in the region, who have expressed uncertainty about his \"America First\" policies. Tillerson has already signaled the limits of Washington's patience with China, criticizing Beijing for its \"predatory economics\" and \"provocative actions in the South China Sea.\"\n\nAt last month's party congress, Xi laid out a vision for a prosperous and assertive China taking a bigger place on the global stage. The congress left China with \"greater confidence and lung power,\" according to Wang Wen, president of Renmin University's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies. The visit by Trump will provide a test of the two leaders' ability to navigate their complex relationship.",
    " Title: \"A Forgettable Farewell: Obama's State of the Union Address Marks the End of an Era\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic moment, President Barack Obama delivered his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, marking the end of his eight-year tenure in the White House. The speech, however, was met with a sense of disappointment and disjointedness, as the president failed to inspire or inform the nation about the real State of the Union.\n\nThe speech, which was more akin to a political campaign address, lacked cohesion and relevance. Instead of outlining an agenda for his final year or setting a legacy-defining vision, President Obama focused on the achievements of his administration and the greatness of the nation.\n\nOne of the most significant omissions in the speech was the absence of any mention of the recent capture of two US Navy ships by Iranian forces. This incident, which escalated tensions in the region, was met with silence during the president's address.\n\nThe speech also failed to address the growing concern over terrorism, a topic that has been at the forefront of the nation's mind following the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California. In contrast to this, the president announced his intention to release more prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, a move that has been met with strong opposition from the Congress, the military, and law enforcement officers.\n\nThe speech was delivered in a chamber filled with political heavyweights, including the new Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and Vice President Joe Biden, who is nearing the end of his political career. The event also saw an unusual display of camaraderie between Senator Bernie Sanders and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a testament to the changing political landscape.\n\nDespite the partisan divide that has characterized his presidency, President Obama lamented the lack of healing in the political arena. However, his speech was criticized for its partisan tone, further highlighting the divisive nature of his administration.\n\nAs the nation looks towards the future, the speech is unlikely to be remembered as a defining moment in President Obama's legacy. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead and the need for new leadership to address the pressing issues facing the country.",
    " Title: House GOP Takes Action to Limit Nationwide Injunctions in Federal Courts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing a contentious issue that has repeatedly hindered President Trump's executive actions, the Trump administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill have taken steps to curtail the practice of federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions. The Department of Justice has issued new guidance to government attorneys, instructing them to argue vigorously in court against such injunctions.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), has also approved legislation to limit the scope of nationwide injunctions. The bill, known as the Injunctive Authority Clarification Act, would instruct judges to write rulings that apply only to the individuals, organizations, or entities that are part of the lawsuit in front of them.\n\nThe federal judiciary, as an independent branch of government, operates under the Constitution's authority to decide cases for the parties before them, not to act as super-legislators for everyone across the country based on a single case. The bill aims to restore this balance of power between the branches of government.\n\nRep. Goodlatte, who approved the bill sent through his committee, stated, \"The Constitution gives courts the authority to decide cases for the parties before them, not to act as super-legislators for everyone across the country based on a single case. It simply can not be the law that opponents of government action can seek a preliminary injunction and lose in 93 of the 94 judicial districts, win one injunction in the 94th, and through that injunction obtain a stay of government action nationwide despite it being upheld everywhere else.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of some of America's leading professors of remedies, federal courts, and administrative law agree that Congress must enact a limit on national injunctions. \"I am pleased that the House Judiciary Committee today approved the Injunctive Authority Clarification Act of 2018 to restore the proper balance of power between the branches of government and I look forward to a vote by the full House of Representatives soon,\" Rep. Goodlatte added.\n\nThe Trump White House's initiative to roll back the constitutionally questionable Obama era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order is another point of contention within the Republican Party and the courts. The future of this issue remains to be seen as the legislation moves forward.",
    " Title: Greenland Purchase Proposal: A Historical Perspective and Current Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent resurfacing of the United States' interest in purchasing Greenland has sparked controversy, with the left expressing skepticism and advocating for strengthening existing alliances instead. The idea of purchasing the autonomous Danish territory is not a new one, with historical attempts dating back to the 1940s and even before.\n\nIn 1946, under President Harry Truman, US Secretary of State James Byrnes discussed the possibility of purchasing Greenland with the Danish foreign minister during a United Nations meeting in New York. This was not the first time such a discussion took place, as Secretary of State William Seward, who oversaw the purchase of Alaska, reportedly explored the idea of buying Greenland from the Danes nearly a century earlier.\n\nGreenland, believed to be rich in natural resources such as iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium, and oil, has much of its resources currently untapped due to the large amounts of ice and permafrost. However, due to global warming, the ice sheet is melting rapidly, making the mining of these resources more feasible.\n\nThe potential acquisition of Greenland, home to 56,000 people, raises concerns about environmental impact and indigenous rights. Greenland's lack of private land ownership and nationalized healthcare system further complicates the matter. In contrast to the United States' approach, Greenland's healthcare industry is entirely nationalized, with free medical care and prescription drugs.\n\nDenmark, a wealthy country with a budget surplus, has no reason to sell Greenland. The Greenlandic population is unlikely to want to switch their allegiance. Instead, the United States would be better off working closely and constructively with European allies, including Denmark and Norway, to protect U.S. interests in the Arctic. Such cooperation can make more economic sense than territorial expansion.\n\nWhile the idea of purchasing Greenland is not new, the current political climate and the potential implications of global warming on Greenland's resources have added a new dimension to the discussion. The circumstances surrounding the proposal are being closely examined, with some arguing that there is enough evidence to support impeachment, even in the absence of an explicit quid pro quo proposal. The focus is on the context and circumstances, with the potential for a criminal exchange being a point of contention.",
    " Title: Bolton's Allegations Cast Uncertainty over Trump's Impeachment Trial as McConnell Expresses Surprise\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent claims by former National Security Advisor John Bolton are causing uncertainty in the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Bolton alleges that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine until it helped with investigations that could potentially harm Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times on Sunday, Bolton's upcoming book contains this account. His lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, provided a copy of the book to the Trump administration on December 30 for review of any classified information.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that the Senate majority leader \"did not have any advance notice\" that the National Security Council had a copy of Bolton's manuscript for weeks. McConnell, who has said he is in \"total coordination\" with the White House on the impeachment trial, reportedly is not pleased with the revelations.\n\nMere hours before the impeachment trial was set to resume on Monday, The Times reported that McConnell and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) privately pressed the president's advisers to explain Bolton's account, which undermines the White House's defense of the president and blindsided several GOP senators.\n\nPresident Trump refuted Bolton's account, tweeting early Monday morning, \"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.\"\n\nThe allegation of Trump's participation in a quid pro quo with Ukraine is at the center of the impeachment trial that began this month in the Senate. The question of whether to call witnesses, including Bolton, to testify has been a contentious issue.\n\nAs Senate majority leader, McConnell has influence over the trial's proceedings, and he has expressed skepticism about the need for additional witness testimony. To call witnesses, Democrats need at least four members of the 53-member Republican majority to vote with them. One potential defector, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), told reporters on Monday that \"it's important to be able to hear from John Bolton for us to be able to make an impartial judgment.\"\n\nAnother potential swing vote, Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), said in a statement on Monday that \"the reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial's outcome remains uncertain as the Senate continues its proceedings. The allegations made by Bolton have added a new layer of complexity to the trial, and the Senate will need to decide whether to call Bolton and other potential witnesses to testify.",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus and Sen. Rand Paul Unite in Push for Complete Obamacare Repeal, Introduce Alternative Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint press conference on Tuesday, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), denounced the Obamacare replacement bill supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and announced the filing of Paul's own bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The group expressed their desire for a complete repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and criticized the current replacement bill as a reformation of Obamacare rather than a true repeal.\n\nSen. Paul, flanked by members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jordan, the previous HFC chairman, emphasized the unity of Republicans in their goal to repeal Obamacare. He stated, \"There is one thing that has united Republicans in 2010, when we won the House; in 2014, when we won the Senate; and 2016 when we won the White House.\"\n\nRep. Jordan argued that in order to bring down costs and improve medical care, Congress must repeal Obamacare completely. He stated that the first step is to vote on the 2015 bill, which was a complete repeal of the PPACA. Sen. Paul added that while Republicans are united in their support for complete repeal, they are divided on how, if at all, to replace the 2010 PPACA.\n\nThe Ohio congressman criticized the bill supported by Ryan and the House Republican leadership, stating that it keeps Medicaid expansion and some of the tax increases, which is not what they promised the American people they would do. Rep. Meadows echoed this sentiment, stating that repealing Obamacare meant repealing all of Obamacare, all of the fees, taxes, and mandates.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus members also expressed their support for a market-centered, patient-centered, and doctor-centered plan that would lower the cost of insurance. They emphasized that all Obamacare replacement bills will be subject to scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, but the score that matters is whether the bill will lower health care costs and premiums.\n\nVice President Mike Pence added to the day's drama by meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus after his regular Tuesday lunch with GOP senators. The meeting was described as direct and focused, with Rep. David Brat (R-Va.) stating that he told Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price that regulations on insurance companies need to be adjusted to make sense.\n\nThe White House put out a statement about the meeting, stating that the Vice President met with conservative leaders in the House to discuss the failures of Obamacare and the need to repeal and replace the law. The Vice President stressed that this is the first step in the process to deliver on the President's promise to the American people and looks forward to House passage of the American Health Care Act, the name of the bill supported by House GOP leadership.",
    " Title: New York Times, Quinnipiac, and CBS News Poll Shows Obama Leading in Key Swing States, but Romney Gains on Economic Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The New York Times, Quinnipiac University, and CBS News has shown President Barack Obama leading in key swing states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, but Mitt Romney is gaining ground on economic issues.\n\nThe poll, which will track the presidential contest in six states over the next three months, found that Mr. Obama holds an advantage of 6 percentage points over Mr. Romney in Florida and Ohio, and a lead of 11 percentage points in Pennsylvania. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points in each state.\n\nThe polls found that Mr. Obama faces substantial hurdles of his own, most of them rooted in the electorate's deeply pessimistic outlook on the economy. By double-digit margins, voters in each state say his policies would hurt, rather than help, their personal financial situation if he wins re-election.\n\nHowever, more than half of voters in each state also say the administration's actions are either slowly improving the economy or will, if given more time.\n\nIn all three states, most women say they prefer Mr. Obama. About half of female voters in Florida back him, while his support is even stronger in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where nearly 6 in 10 women say they favor him. In Ohio, men prefer Mr. Romney, while they are more closely split in Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe economy is the top concern in all three states. But voters in Ohio express more optimism about their own backyard, with 33 percent saying their economy is improving, compared with 23 percent in Florida. Ohio's unemployment rate, 7.2 percent, is the lowest of the three states and below the national rate.\n\nA sliver of voters, 4 percent in each state, say they are undecided between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. Only about one in 10 who have picked a candidate say they could change their minds, fewer than some polls showed at this point in previous races.\n\nMr. Obama has a clear advantage on personal measures, and far more voters say he cares about the needs and problems of people like them. Mr. Romney is seen as being able to do a comparable job on the economy. More voters in Florida say his economic policies would be better for their own financial situations. Among independent voters in the state, the poll found Mr. Romney outpacing Mr. Obama by 14 percentage points when asked who would perform better on the economy.\n\nThe president drew broad support from voters in each state for a proposal to raise income taxes on people whose household income is more than $250,000. The plan received the backing of 58 percent of likely voters in Florida, 60 percent in Ohio, and 62 percent in Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Romney has endured criticism for declining to release more than two years of his tax returns, and at least half the voters, including about half the independent voters, in each state say presidential candidates should release several years of returns.\n\nThe state polls were conducted by telephone, both landlines and cellphones, from July 24 through July 30 among 1,177 likely voters in Florida, 1,193 likely voters in Ohio, and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania. The findings cannot be compared with previous surveys because the polls are a measure of people who are likely to vote, rather than those who are simply registered. While the intensity of the race is high, it remains an open question how much the summer campaigning will influence the outcome. Tens of millions of dollars have been invested on television advertising in the states, but most voters say they are not swayed by the commercials.",
    " Title: Evidence Emerges of Russian Military and Intelligence Involvement in Eastern Ukraine Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Ukraine's interim government has presented evidence suggesting that Russian military and intelligence forces are fueling the unrest that has engulfed the eastern part of the country since the annexation of Crimea last month.\n\nThe New York Times reports that photographs and descriptions circulated by the Kiev government show that some of the so-called \"green men\" - armed men who have seized government buildings and demanded Crimea-style referendums on joining Russia - have been identified in other photos as being among Russian troops.\n\nOne of the men in the photos has been identified as Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a veteran Russian military and intelligence operative. Strelkov is believed to have served Russia undercover both in Crimea and in the city of Slovyansk, one of the epicenters of the most recent unrest.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian authorities released a wanted poster for Mr. Strelkov, accompanied by a pencil sketch of his gaunt face. \"What, they can't even get a proper photo of him?\" one of the men behind the sandbagged entrance to the city council of Slovyansk over the weekend, who referred to himself simply as Daisy, told a Wall Street Journal reporter. When asked about the role of Russian intelligence, the man declined to answer and told a reporter to leave immediately.\n\nThe Obama administration has endorsed the claims of the Ukrainians, stating that Russia could face new economic sanctions if government buildings currently occupied by demonstrators are not vacated under the terms of an agreement reached Thursday among Russian, Ukrainian, American, and European diplomats. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive in Ukraine Monday morning to meet with Ukraine's interim prime minister and president, as well as other officials.\n\nRussian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly denied that Russian forces are involved in the unrest, which began after the February ousting of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. That message is echoed by the separatists themselves, who claim their movement is entirely homegrown and a response to what they consider an illegal coup that led to Yanukovych's downfall.\n\nThe unit accused of operating in eastern Ukraine is known as the GRU, the Russian acronym for the Main Intelligence Department of the Russian General Staff. It is an elite Russian military intelligence unit that has participated in virtually every military conflict in which Moscow has been embroiled in recent decades, including wars in Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Georgia.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, Ukraine's State Security Service alleges that Russian operatives are coordinating pro-Russian militias, helping them identify targets, and carrying out seizures of key installations, such as police and security headquarters, government offices, and communications infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian security officials say Russian intelligence has spent years building up a network of sleeper agents in eastern Ukraine. One of them, they say, is Igor Bezler, a 49-year-old Crimean native who they say served in the GRU until 2002, when he moved to the eastern city of Horlivka. There, he worked as a security guard and as head of a funeral company.\n\nLast week, after a pro-Russian mob took over the town's police station, a video posted on a local news organization's website showed him parading in fatigues in front of a couple of dozen local police, identifying himself as a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army and telling them they had a new chief. Ukrainian officials allege he was tasked earlier this month with seizing state-security buildings in the Donetsk region, then taking the police station in Horlivka.\n\n\"The fact that the Russians have woken up these networks is evidence that we're dealing with a serious operation, not a game,\" a senior Ukrainian security official told the Journal. Now, Mr. Bezler is occupying the police station with a group of armed men, officials say. According to local police, Mr. Bezler told them he had an order \"from the center in Slovyansk\" to hold the building at any cost and had sufficient force to do so.\n\nThe separatists' ultimate goal remains unclear. Some discuss federalization within Ukraine; others seek independence; yet others dream of a Crimea scenario, inspired by Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent mention of Novorossiya (literally, New Russia), a tsarist-era imperial term for what is now southeastern Ukraine. Moscow's goals in comparison to the Crimea campaign have also remained unclear.",
    " Title: Impeachment Inquiry Overshadows Democratic Presidential Primary Race, Candidates Face Challenges Highlighting Key Policy Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has cast a long shadow over the Democratic presidential primary race, as candidates grapple with how to draw attention to their key policy issues amid the partisan fight in Congress and on the campaign trail.\n\nAfter months of resistance, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment effort on Tuesday, accusing Trump of seeking foreign help to damage Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden ahead of the November 2020 election. Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry ensures a partisan fight in Congress and on the campaign trail in the coming months. Kurt Meyer, Democratic party chairman for three rural Iowa counties north of Des Moines, the state's most populous city, said he expects the impeachment proceedings to energize the Democratic base.\n\n\"If a highly motivated person drags her mother and her husband and her second cousin twice removed to the polls, then it makes a difference,\" Meyer said.\n\nBut in a sign the probe could energize Trump's base as well, his re-election campaign raised a quarter of a million dollars in just 15 minutes on Tuesday in the immediate aftermath of Pelosi's announcement about the probe. Trump was quick to portray himself as the victim of partisan Democratic attacks, while his campaign sent repeated fundraising appeals to his supporters on Tuesday pegged to the impeachment launch.\n\nThere is a risk that any substantive policy discussions among the 19 Democrats running for the party's nomination to take on Trump in the 2020 election will be drowned out in the growing battle between allies and foes of Trump, several Democratic strategists and experts said.\n\n\"Trump has been the elephant in the room, but the democratic debates so far have been really policy-centered. I think impeachment now takes center stage,\" said Erin O'Brien, associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts, Boston.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked with congressional leaders, said Republican messaging just got simpler, if less positive.\n\n\"For Democrats running for president, breaking through on healthcare or the economy just got a lot tougher,\" he said. \"Impeachment will be the dominant topic for a long time.\"\n\nBiden, who leads polls in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Trump, said on Tuesday he would back impeachment if the Republican president fails to comply with congressional requests for information on Ukraine and other matters. Trump has raised unsubstantiated charges that Biden improperly tried to halt a Ukrainian probe of a company with ties to his son, without providing any evidence of wrongdoing by either.\n\nBiden's Democratic rivals, including U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris, are set to benefit if the front-runner falls off. But most have so far refused to be drawn into specific questions about Biden and his family, and are likely to stay that way for now.\n\nWarren, who edged past Sanders for the first time to rank second behind Biden in the latest poll with 14% support, said on Twitter the impeachment inquiry was \"an overdue but important step.\"\n\n\"No one is above the law\u2014not even the president of the United States,\" Warren said, without mentioning Biden. \"Thank you to everyone who protested, organized, and asked the crucial questions to get us to this moment.\"\n\nSo far, Trump has proven remarkably resilient in the face of repeated scandals and retaining strong support from Republicans. Democrats should act swiftly to convince voters their actions are necessary - and prevent Trump from successfully arguing he is being unfairly prosecuted, said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nRebecca Cordova, 62, from the suburbs of Austin, Texas, who describes herself as an independent but voted for Trump in 2016, said it would take strong evidence of wrongdoing to dissuade her from voting for him again.\n\n\"I think the Democrats are just blowing smoke. They're just trying to start something up like they did with (Russia),\" she said, referring to former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"I don't believe the Russians helped and I don't believe any of this with the Ukrainians, sorry.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Justin Amash Resigns from House Freedom Caucus, Leaving a Legacy of Libertarianism and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a move that marks a significant shift in the political landscape, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) has resigned from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican lawmakers that he co-founded in 2015. Amash, known for his libertarian views and outspoken nature, announced his departure on Monday evening, citing a desire to avoid being a distraction for the group.\n\nThe resignation was confirmed by Poppy Nelson, an Amash spokesperson, to various media outlets on Tuesday. Amash's departure from the Freedom Caucus had been anticipated for some time, following the group's formal condemnation of him on May 20, after he called for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n\nAmash, who was part of the wave of tea party Republican lawmakers that swept into power in the 2010 election, co-founded the House Freedom Caucus with nine other freshman Republicans. The Caucus, notorious for its role in pushing out then-House Speaker John Boehner in October 2015, does not make its membership list public, making it unclear who currently belongs to the group. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is believed to serve as its current chairman.\n\nTrump has had a contentious relationship with the group, but in December 2018, they collaborated to force a government shutdown over border wall funding. The President sided with the group's leaders over the objections of congressional Republican leaders, demanding that any government funding include appropriations for a border wall.\n\nAmash made headlines in May when he became the first Republican member of Congress to call for Trump's impeachment. In a Twitter thread, Amash alleged that the President had committed \"impeachable conduct,\" referring to obstruction of justice during the investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump responded with criticism, but Amash has remained firm in his call for impeachment.\n\nAmash is known for his transparency, having explained almost every single vote he took in Congress, from substantive votes on tax reform to symbolic votes on the naming of post offices. His office used to post explanations on his Facebook page, but it appears that they have stopped doing so.\n\nAmash gained attention in 2017 when he missed a vote in Congress for the first time, after a scheduling mishap. He cried, a rare display of emotion in the often stoic world of politics.\n\nThere has been speculation about Amash running for president in 2020, either as a libertarian or to challenge Trump in the Republican primary. In a May 29 op-ed, Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis wrote, \"as a conservative who has grave concerns about Donald Trump, I\u2019ve arrived at an unavoidable conclusion: it\u2019s time to draft Justin Amash for president.\" Amash has not entirely ruled out the possibility.\n\nAmash's departure from the House Freedom Caucus marks the end of an era, leaving behind a legacy of libertarianism and controversy. His departure, however, does not signal a departure from the political stage, as many speculate he may have future political aspirations.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Congress to Fund Two Years of Free Community College for All Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Lake Area Technical Institute's commencement ceremony in Watertown, South Dakota on Friday, President Barack Obama called on Congress to close tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires and use the savings to fund two years of free community college for all Americans.\n\nThe President emphasized the growing importance of community colleges in the 21st-century economy and expressed his belief that two years of free community college should be made available to everyone. However, his proposal remains stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nAddressing the graduating class, President Obama said, \"I didn't come here to inspire you. I came here because you, the graduates, inspire me. You've lived through some of the toughest economic times in your country's history and you still chose to come here and invest in yourself because you still believe America is a place where you can make it if you try.\"\n\nThe President has previously spoken at numerous graduation ceremonies during his time in office, including those at Notre Dame, Northwestern University, West Point, and others. He chose to visit the small South Dakota technical school this year to underscore his belief that every American deserves at least some higher education, whether it comes at a major university or a small community college.\n\n\"Our budgets should reflect that we care about you, and that means giving everybody in America the chance you've had here,\" he said. \"I want to lower the cost of community college to zero... We can't afford to let striving Americans be priced out of the education they need to get ahead.\"",
    " Title: WikiLeaks Clarifies: Edward Snowden Has Not Yet Accepted Asylum in Venezuela\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a clarifying statement, WikiLeaks has confirmed that former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has not yet formally accepted asylum in Venezuela, contradicting a previous statement made by a Russian lawmaker. The statement came in response to a tweet by Alexei Pushkov, the head of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, who had earlier suggested that Snowden had decided on Venezuela as his destination.\n\nThe confusion arose from remarks made by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who had offered asylum to Snowden. Maduro, speaking at a meeting with Panama's president, described the potential asylum as a \"first collective humanitarian asylum\" and suggested that Snowden would have to make his own decision about traveling to Venezuela.\n\nWikiLeaks, which has been providing logistical support to Snowden since he fled the United States, issued a cryptic tweet on Tuesday, stating that the \"first phase of Edward Snowden's 'Flight of Liberty' campaign will be launched\" on Wednesday. The organization, which has spoken on behalf of Snowden regarding political asylum, reminded readers that the final decision would be made by the concerned states and confirmed by WikiLeaks.\n\nSnowden, who revealed details of a U.S. intelligence program to monitor Internet activity, has been in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since June 23. He was believed to be headed for Cuba but did not board the flight and has not been seen publicly since. The U.S. annulled his passport, making it difficult for him to travel further or leave the airport's transit zone.\n\nFor Snowden to leave for South America, he would need Venezuela to issue him travel documents and find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight from Moscow to South America stops in Havana, Cuba, which could cause complications, as some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace last week due to suspicions that Snowden was on his plane.\n\nThe White House has stated that it wants Snowden to return to the United States, where he is wanted on felony charges. The Obama administration sent an extradition request to Iceland's foreign ministry last week, according to WikiLeaks, citing an Icelandic news report. Iceland, where WikiLeaks has operated, is among about 30 countries Snowden has applied to for asylum.",
    " Title: California Imposes Tougher COVID-19 Restrictions as Cases Surge Across State and Nation\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered the closure of indoor non-essential businesses in 19 counties, including Los Angeles County and Orange County, in an effort to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. The new restrictions, which will remain in place for at least three weeks, affect bars, dine-in restaurants, indoor movie theaters, and indoor tasting rooms at wineries. Restaurants may remain open for takeout meals.\n\nThe announcement comes just ahead of the July 4 weekend, a time when Newsom expressed concern about people in coronavirus hot spots ignoring public health guidelines and making the situation worse. California reported 110 deaths on Wednesday, the most the state has recorded since April, and nearly 6,000 new cases, Newsom said. Hospitalizations have jumped 51 percent in the past two weeks, and ICU admissions are up 47 percent over the same period.\n\n\"Please disabuse yourself that somehow, people are no longer dying,\" Newsom said. \"Please do not take your guard down, please do not believe those that somehow want to manipulate the reality that is demonstrable in those lives lost and those families that have been torn apart because of COVID-19.\"\n\nNewsom allowed local governments to begin reopening in early May. The most recent reopening phase took effect in mid-June and allowed retail stores, bars, dine-in restaurants, gyms, and hair and nail salons to reopen with certain occupancy restrictions. However, the new closures are being targeted at trouble spots, rather than being imposed statewide.\n\n\"We're focusing and targeting local parts of the state where we're seeing an increase in community spread and we're seeing an increase in the positivity rate,\" Newsom said Wednesday. \"Not every part of the state is impacted equally, and as a consequence, we are not targeting on a statewide level these rules and regulations, we are focusing in on areas of concern.\"\n\nCalifornia's restrictions come as an increasing number of states have been backtracking their reopenings as coronavirus cases and hospitalization spike just ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend. States like Arizona, Georgia, Texas, and Ohio all reported record numbers of cases on Wednesday. Some records have been broken on a near-daily basis, while others were set at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring.\n\nNationally, more than 48,000 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Tuesday, according to data collected by the New York Times. The surge in cases across the country has raised concerns about the ability of hospitals to handle the influx of patients, and the potential for a second wave of the virus in the fall.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the pandemic is far from over, and that the world must remain vigilant in its efforts to control the spread of the virus. Cure Violence Global founder Gary Slutkin, who has studied the patterns of violence and epidemics, has said that the two follow similar patterns, and that the key to controlling both is to focus on the areas where the spread is most concentrated.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to evolve, it remains unclear when life will return to normal, and when the world will be able to fully emerge from the shadow of COVID-19. However, one thing is certain: the fight against the virus is far from over, and the actions of individuals can have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.",
    " Title: Gallup Poll Reveals Tight Race Between Trump and Obama as Most Admired Man in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political landscape marked by deep divisions, the latest Gallup poll has revealed a surprising dead heat between former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump as the most admired man in America. This finding underscores the political polarization that continues to shape the nation.\n\nThe poll, an annual tradition since 1948, asked Americans to name the man and woman they admire most, regardless of nationality. In the survey conducted between Dec. 2 and 15, both Obama and Trump were named by 18% of respondents. However, the results were predictably partisan, with 41% of Democrats naming Obama and 45% of Republicans choosing Trump.\n\nThe sitting president is typically the choice for most admired man, taking the honor in 58 of the 72 prior polls. This year, no other man was mentioned by more than 2% of respondents. The top 10 men, in addition to Obama and Trump, included President Jimmy Carter, businessman Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Pope Francis, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Dalai Lama, and Warren Buffet.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Michelle Obama was named the most admired woman in America. The former first lady was followed by First Lady Melania Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, and climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who tied for third place.\n\nThe remainder of the top 10 women included Queen Elizabeth II, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.\n\nGallup noted that Trump's job approval rating has improved, with 45% approving of his performance, marking some of his best ratings as president. Despite Trump becoming the third president in history to be impeached by Congress earlier this month, his popularity seems to have remained relatively stable.\n\nCoincident with the rise in his job approval rating, the 18% of Americans currently naming Trump as the most admired man is also up, from 13% in 2018 and 14% in 2017, according to Gallup. The poll's findings underscore the deep political divide in America, with the two most powerful figures of the last decade locked in a tight race for the title of most admired man.",
    " Title: Tea Party Challengers Emerging as Conservative Groups Rally Against Establishment Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals a renewed push for conservative values within the Republican Party, Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel announced on Thursday his intention to challenge U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in the Republican primary next year. The announcement comes a day after Sen. Cochran voted to end the 16-day government shutdown and grant President Obama more borrowing authority.\n\nThe decision by Sen. McDaniel was met with immediate support from outside groups that had rallied against this week's debt and spending agreement. Daniel Horowitz, deputy political director of the Madison Project, stated, \"Our country can't afford any more bad votes that stem from old friends and back-room deals. And as witnessed from the recent budget battle against Obamacare, we can't win against Democrats if we don't grow our conservative bench in the Senate.\"\n\nThe past two weeks have seen deep divisions within the GOP on public display, with Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, and their allies pushing to withhold all government spending unless President Obama agreed to cancel Obamacare, while party leaders called that a losing strategy and tried to come up with alternatives.\n\nOn Thursday, the GOP accepted defeat, passing a bill that gives President Obama a \"clean\" bill to reopen government through January, and to raise the debt through at least February. A majority of Republicans supported the deal in the Senate, but the situation was reversed in the House, where Cruz allies refused to sign off on a series of plans put forward by GOP leaders to end the stalemate.\n\nAhead of the vote, each side blamed the other for squandering leverage. Tea party lawmakers say they could have won if all Republicans had stuck together, and the lesson they draw is that they need to oust those who surrendered. Sen. Cruz's battle cry seemed to resonate Thursday across the country with a new generation of tea-party-style candidates who have announced bids to run against veteran GOP lawmakers in 2014.\n\nIn South Carolina, Nancy Mace, the first female graduate of The Citadel, lampooned GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham for being the sole Republican in the state's congressional delegation to support the debt deal. Another Graham opponent, state Sen. Lee Bright, also blasted the deal, saying, \"We didn't get anything... We surrendered again.\"\n\nIn Tennessee, state Rep. Joe Carr accused Sen. Lamar Alexander of violating conservative principles by voting to raise the debt ceiling without any accompanying spending cuts. And in Louisville, Ky., Matt Bevin, a wealthy businessman running against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, praised Sen. Cruz as the new face of the conservative movement and blasted Mr. McConnell, who wrote the final debt deal with his Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party's 2008 vice president candidate, also weighed in, urging her supporters via Facebook not to \"be discouraged by the shenanigans of D.C.'s permanent political class today.\"\n\n\"We're going to shake things up in 2014,\" Mrs. Palin said. \"Rest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let's start with Kentucky\u2014which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi\u2014from sea to shining sea we will not give up. We've only just begun to fight.\"\n\nHowever, the tea party could face an uphill battle in the 2014 campaign season. A new Pew Research Center poll found the popularity of the tea party\u2014including within Republican ranks\u2014has plummeted in recent months and even more so since 2010 when it helped the GOP take over the House. Now 49 percent of the public has an unfavorable view of the tea party, compared to 30 percent who hold a favorable view.\n\nJim Manley, a Democratic strategist, said that the budget stalemate may have weakened the tea party within Congress, though it hasn't been eliminated. \"What's interesting is that more and more senators have had it with the antics of Sens. Cruz and Lee,\" Mr. Manley said. \"The 'just say no' crowd is down to only 18 in the Senate Republican caucus, a tremendous change from only a few months ago.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Contemplates Increased Aid as Europe Faces Mounting Migrant Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the escalating influx of Syrian refugees and migrants into Europe, the Obama administration has announced that it is actively exploring ways to offer further assistance, potentially by admitting more refugees into the United States.\n\nThe migrant crisis has strained the infrastructure of countries such as Greece, Macedonia, and Hungary, and has exposed divisions within the European Union. While Germany's vice chancellor has suggested that his country could accommodate at least half a million migrants annually, he has also called for other EU members to contribute more. In contrast, Hungary's prime minister is urging the completion of a 13-foot border fence with Serbia before the end of the year, as thousands of migrants remain trapped in large camps due to closed borders.\n\nAccording to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, many of the migrants are fleeing economic hardship rather than seeking asylum for their lives. Hungarian authorities are reportedly obstructing migrants' journey through southeastern Europe towards the West. Romania has stated that migrant quotas are not a viable solution, while the EU maintains that unity and solidarity are essential for Europe to overcome the crisis.\n\nOn Monday, both France and Britain pledged to accept thousands of migrants, with France committing to 24,000 and Britain to 20,000. However, these numbers fall significantly short of Germany's recent intake, which saw at least 20,000 migrants over the weekend. Germany has also allocated $6.7 billion to manage the crisis.\n\nIn terms of potential U.S. involvement, the White House has stated that it is examining a variety of strategies to respond more effectively to the global refugee crisis, including refugee resettlement. The administration notes that the U.S. has provided over $4 billion in humanitarian aid since the onset of the Syrian crisis, and over $1 billion this year.\n\nAs of 2015, more than 367,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea in search of safety and better opportunities in Europe, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency. Of this total, over 244,000 have arrived in Greece, and at least 121,000 have reached Italy. The number of migrants increased significantly in August, reaching nearly 130,000, according to the UN agency.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Economic Narrative: A Comparison to Bill Clinton's Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her bid for the presidency, Hillary Clinton is positioning herself as a candidate who will bring about an economic policy akin to her husband's administration, rather than a third term for Barack Obama. This strategy involves emphasizing the ongoing struggles of the American middle class and the economic landscape's transformation.\n\nZachary Karabell, the head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of \"The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World,\" has observed this shift in Clinton's rhetoric. He notes that Clinton has been highlighting the 1990s as a model for effective economic policies, even when compared to Ronald Reagan's administration.\n\nClinton has been emphasizing the economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction that occurred during her husband's presidency. In a speech last year, she stated, \"The 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long-term economic trends, it\u2019s possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity.\"\n\nThe economic conditions of the 1990s, compared to the present, offer a potential strong foundation for Clinton's campaign, given the widespread economic concerns in today's society. However, the comparison between the two periods is complex, as the economic landscape has undergone significant changes since the 1990s.\n\nIn 1991, Bill Clinton campaigned on a platform to revitalize an ailing economy marked by massive layoffs in manufacturing during the 1991 recession. The situation today, while statistically improved with a lower unemployment rate, is arguably more challenging due to factors such as lower worker participation rates and stagnant wages for the majority of workers.\n\nThe Clinton campaign aims to portray government, in conjunction with individual initiatives and businesses, as a means to boost opportunities, implying that this approach was successful during her husband's presidency. The economic boom of the 1990s, marked by increased employment and economic growth, as well as improved sentiment about the economy, provides a basis for this argument.\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton's economic narrative revolves around a return to the policies and successes of her husband's administration. The effectiveness of this strategy will depend on her ability to navigate the complexities of the current economic landscape and address the challenges facing the American middle class.",
    " Title: GOP Eyes Permanent Individual Tax Cuts, Prepares for Phase Two of Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted just a few months ago, has prompted Republicans to look ahead to the next phase of tax reform, aiming to capitalize on the midterm elections by making individual tax cuts permanent. The strategy could potentially put Democrats in a challenging position, as it may force them to vote against popular tax cuts.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"We hope to gain support from our Democrat friends. In fact, one of the pushbacks we heard from the Democrats was if these tax cuts are so good, why didn't we make them permanent? We've got no problem with that.\"\n\nUnder the current law, individual tax cuts are set to expire in ten years. Republicans were compelled to make them temporary due to budget rules, which required no Democrat support for the bill's passage. Now, the GOP sees an opportunity to make them permanent ahead of the midterm elections, with the potential consequence of Democrats being on record against the cuts if they fail to secure the necessary votes.\n\nWalker stated, \"I don't know if you would call it support, but at least acknowledgment from some of our Democratic colleagues that tax reform is working in many parts of our country.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers have signaled that they might release parts of phase two of the tax plan on April 15. Walker, a former pastor, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News that this second phase will likely consist of smaller adjustment bills. One of the specific bills he mentioned is the Universal Charitable Giving Act, which would allow families and non-itemizers to deduct charitable donations.\n\nWalker explained that this bill ensures the new tax plan will not negatively impact donations to churches and non-profits. \"We want to make sure that those gifts are protected,\" the North Carolina lawmaker said.\n\nHowever, Walker does not expect another attempt at repealing the Johnson Amendment through tax reform. \"We believe and hear that it is picking up some energy. At some point, we would like to attach it to something this year,\" he said, acknowledging that the Johnson Amendment was not included in tax reform but remains a priority for many conservatives.\n\nLawmakers believe they could begin voting on parts of phase two as early as this month.",
    " Title: Mueller Threatens to Subpoena Trump as Special Counsel Probe Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly warned that he could order President Donald Trump to testify, marking the first time a subpoena has been mentioned in the probe.\n\nAccording to US media, this threat of a subpoena was made during talks with Trump's legal team in March. The president's lawyers had insisted that Trump was under no obligation to face questions from federal investigators regarding the Russia inquiry. However, Mueller's team reportedly responded by suggesting they would issue a subpoena if Trump declined.\n\nThe White House announced on Wednesday that Ty Cobb, Trump's main legal representative in the probe, is stepping down. Cobb had been considering retirement for some time and decided to leave at the end of this month.\n\nThe president's former lawyer, John Dowd, has also confirmed that Mueller mentioned the possibility of forcing Trump to face questions. Dowd, who resigned about a week and a half after the meeting, said he told investigators that the probe was not \"some game,\" adding, \"You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\"\n\nThe list of possible questions has since been published, covering Trump's motivations in dismissing former FBI director James Comey last May and his campaign's contacts with Russia. Trump repeated his claim that the Russia inquiry is a \"witch hunt\" on Wednesday.\n\nThe evolving strategies of the president's legal team are playing out in full view, with the possibility of a subpoena adding a new layer of complexity to the investigation. Trump and his lawyers may argue that a president cannot be compelled to answer such wide-ranging questions.\n\nThe president has reportedly cooled on the idea of willingly meeting with Mueller, a result of his feeling that the Mueller team is out to get him. There have been hints that his legal advisers are torn on the matter.\n\nThis week's revelations, including the publication of possible Mueller questions and the subpoena threat, may explain the president's changing stance. It remains unclear when Mueller will request a meeting with the president.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is the only Justice Department official with the authority to fire Mueller, has been reportedly targeted for impeachment by House Republicans. Speaking on Tuesday, Rosenstein addressed the threats against him, saying, \"I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.\"\n\nThe special counsel is investigating Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and Trump's election campaign, and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry. Mueller was appointed special counsel following Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey last May.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Unveil Police Reform Bill, Senate Democrats Criticize Lack of Progressive Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the ongoing national conversation on police reform, Senate Republicans unveiled their \"Justice Act\" on Wednesday, which aims to hold officers accountable through an enhanced use-of-force database, pursue restrictions on chokeholds, and create new commissions to study law enforcement and race. The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, in response to the death of George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide protests demanding racial justice.\n\nSen. Scott framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color, stating, \"The answer to the question of which side do you support is 'I support America.' If you support America, you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority.\"\n\nThe Senate Democrats, however, have already expressed criticism of the Republican bill even before its official unveiling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deemed the GOP legislation inadequate, stating, \"The Senate proposal of studies and reporting without transparency and accountability is inadequate.\"\n\nThe Republican bill does not ban chokeholds outright and does not end qualified immunity, two key provisions of the Democrats' police reform legislation, the Justice in Policing Act. This legislation would lower the bar for police officers to face criminal prosecution and create a national database of cops who have committed misconduct.\n\nThe GOP bill does include measures to address chokeholds, encouraging agencies to phase out the practice or risk losing federal funds. It also provides funding for training to \"de-escalate\" situations and establishes a \"duty to intervene\" protocol to prevent excessive force.\n\nThe Republican package also includes bipartisan proposals, such as making lynching a federal hate crime and launching a study of the social status of black men and boys. The bill also extends funding for various federal law enforcement programs, including the COPS program, and establishes a National Criminal Justice Commission Act.\n\nThe bill also includes other proposals, such as tapping the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a law enforcement training curriculum on \"the history of racism in the United States.\" Another provision closes a loophole to prohibit federal law enforcement officers from engaging in sexual acts with those being arrested or in custody.\n\nThe GOP effort seeks to reach across the aisle to Democrats in several ways, but the Democrats have already panned the legislation as not going far enough. The bill's focus on studies and commissions, rather than immediate action, has been a point of contention. The bill's title, the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere (JUSTICE) Act, reflects the Republican's aim to present a unifying approach to police reform. The bill is set to be voted on the Senate floor next week, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
    " Title: Ellison Faces Criticism as Frontrunner for DNC Chair Amid Israel Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Howard Dean has withdrawn from the race to reclaim his position, citing time constraints as the primary reason for his decision. With Dean's exit, Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison has emerged as the frontrunner, but he now faces criticism over his ability to balance the role of DNC chairman while remaining in the House of Representatives.\n\nAt a meeting of DNC chair candidates in Denver on Friday, Ellison addressed the concerns, stating, \"I am in the process of deciding this issue of whether I can perform both roles... I've loved being in Congress... but I do think that it is more important to build and strengthen the DNC.\"\n\nHistorically, elected officials have held the position of DNC chair, but some Democrats, including members of the Obama administration, have expressed reservations about the demands of leading the party under President Donald Trump's administration. Ellison's symbolic position as the first Muslim elected to Congress could be an asset in opposing Trump, but his past critical comments regarding US foreign policy and Israel may impact his chances for the DNC post.\n\nRecent revelations have raised concerns about Ellison's ability to represent the Democratic Party's traditional support for a strong and secure Israel, as stated by the Anti-Defamation League. In response, Ellison issued an open letter on Thursday, affirming his commitment to Israel's safety and security and his support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nEllison was an early favorite for the DNC job, earning endorsements from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom support a more populist position for the Democratic Party. Ellison's departure leaves him with two remaining opponents: South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley. Both candidates emphasize the importance of rebuilding state parties after the November elections.\n\n\"We must become a community organization, working in our neighborhoods with grassroots activists,\" said Mr. Harrison. Mr. Buckley suggested a leadership structure in which he handles the practical aspects of running the party while Ellison or Harrison serves as the public face of the party. Dean, who championed the \"50 state strategy\" during his previous tenure as DNC chair, also called for a new leadership approach to address the concerns of younger Democrats, a key constituency for the party moving forward.\n\nDean cautioned against reopening the ideological divisions within the party that emerged during the primaries, stating, \"We can not let this be a proxy fight... We have to get rid of this idea that there is a Bernie Democrat or a Hillary Democrat or an Obama Democrat.\" The DNC chair will be decided in February, when the more than 400 members of the DNC will vote on who will lead the party during Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Reallocates $3.8 Billion for Border Wall Construction, Sparking Controversy Among Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy among lawmakers, the Trump administration announced on Thursday that it is reallocating $3.8 billion from various weapons programs to support the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The decision, which has been met with criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, is seen as a bypass of Congress's authority over federal spending.\n\nThe Pentagon announced that it is transferring $2.2 billion from its base fiscal 2020 budget and $1.6 billion from the Overseas Contingency Operations war fund to the Department of Defense's counter-drug fund, which will then be used for border wall construction.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has identified areas along the southern border as drug smuggling corridors, and has determined that the construction of additional physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the U.S. border is necessary to impede and deny drug smuggling activities, according to a notice delivered to Congress.\n\nThis is not the first time the administration has used executive authority to shift federal funds to the wall, largely due to Democratic lawmakers' opposition to immigration enforcement funding. The announcement has already rankled lawmakers who demand that the White House seek congressional approval first.\n\n\"While some of our Republican colleagues will lament the President's decision, they enabled this theft by blocking our efforts to stop the President from raiding defense accounts,\" said New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who serves as the House Appropriations Committee chairwoman, in a joint statement with the chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, Democratic Rep. Pete Visclosky of Indiana.\n\nDemocratic criticism was to be expected, but one top Republican lawmaker also took a shot at the administration on Thursday. \"The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress's constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action,\" said Texas GOP Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. Thornberry said he would be in touch with his colleagues on determining the \"appropriate steps to take.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump first declared an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border in February 2019, allowing him to use executive authority to reallocate federal funds. Congress has twice attempted to rescind the president's emergency declaration, but was unable to overturn his vetoes both times.\n\nThe Trump administration has set an ambitious goal of completing 450 border wall miles by the tail end of 2020, tackling a campaign goal ahead of the November presidential elections. Customs and Border Protection announced in a document obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation that the administration built 119 miles of new border wall in places where dilapidated walls existed or where no walls previously existed as of Feb. 7.",
    " Title: Shift in Democratic Tactics: From Allegations of Misconduct to Questions of Temperament in Kavanaugh Confirmation Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Supreme Court nomination process of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the political landscape has undergone a significant transformation. Initially, the Democrats were vocal in their opposition, labeling Kavanaugh as an evil offspring of infamous figures such as Charles Manson and Pol Pot. However, as the confirmation process unfolded, the narrative has shifted dramatically.\n\nOn July 9, the day President Donald Trump announced Judge Kavanaugh as his choice for the court, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer announced his intention to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination. He stated, \"The stakes are simply too high,\" Breitbart reported.\n\nAs the Democrats' arsenal of accusations\u2014racism, sexism, or homophobia\u2014is limited, they opted to portray Kavanaugh as a sexual predator, ultimately labeling him a rapist with no evidence or corroboration. This tactic, however, has dissipated in the face of Kavanaugh's compelling defense at the Senate hearing and President Trump's subsequent approval of an additional FBI investigation into the collapsing allegations.\n\nThe Democrats' allegations against Judge Kavanaugh have now transitioned from \"he's a serial rapist\" to \"he drank too much in college.\" They have also suggested that Kavanaugh's defense of himself, during the Senate hearing, indicated a lack of \"temperament\" to be a Supreme Court justice.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a key figure in this process, has been criticized for her comments on Kavanaugh's \"temperament.\" In a meeting of the committee, she stated, \"Judge Kavanaugh used as much political rhetoric as my Republican colleagues, and what's more, he went on the attack.\"\n\nThis shift in narrative raises questions about the truth of the initial allegations and the Democrats' understanding of them. The New York Times, for instance, reported an incident from Kavanaugh's college days, where he was accused of throwing ice on someone at a bar.\n\nAs the confirmation process continues, it is crucial to remember the tactics used by the Democrats and the potential implications for American politics and society. The actions of the Democrats in this process serve as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance and informed voting in the upcoming elections.",
    " Title: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates Warns of Credibility Problems for Both Presidential Candidates in Foreign Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has stated that the next president is likely to face an international crisis shortly after taking office, and both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have a credibility problem in foreign affairs.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, Gates, who has served eight presidents over 50 years, criticized Clinton for her role in advocating for the use of the U.S. military to bring about regime change in Libya, and for failing to anticipate the chaos that followed. He compared this failure to the criticism Democrats levied against the Bush 43 administration's handling of post-Saddam Iraq.\n\nRegarding Trump, Gates said, \"When it comes to credibility problems, Donald Trump is in a league of his own.\" He cited Trump's proposals for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, for torturing suspected terrorists and their families, for supporting Vladimir Putin's dictatorial leadership, and for praising Saddam Hussein's nonexistent successes against terrorism.\n\nGates, who most recently worked under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, assessed the candidates' positions on various global national security issues, including China, North Korea, Iran, Russia, and international trade. He warned of an early test of U.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf and Iran's continuing regional subversion.\n\nThough he has serious concerns with both candidates, Clinton fares slightly better than Trump, according to Gates. He urged Clinton to address her trustworthiness, demonstrate her judgment, and provide specific details about her plans for dealing with global issues.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, Gates said, is \"beyond repair\" on national security issues. He criticized Trump for his lack of knowledge about the world and his unsuitability to lead the U.S. military.\n\nGates concluded by stating that Clinton's approach to these issues would significantly impact voter decisions, including his own. However, he deemed Trump's stance as irreparable on national security matters.",
    " Title: \"Pennsylvania Resident Fined for Driving During Stay-at-Home Order: A Question of Balancing Public Health and Civil Liberties\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAnita Shaffer, a resident of Pennsylvania, found herself in a controversial situation after receiving a $200 fine for driving during the state's stay-at-home order aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. Shaffer, who was pulled over by state police officers for a supposed taillight issue, was issued a ticket stating she violated the state's Disease Control and Prevention Act and failed to abide by the governor and secretary of health's orders to control the spread of a communicable disease.\n\nShaffer, in an interview with PennLive's Jan Murphy, stated, \"He asked me if I was aware of the stay-at-home act. I am aware of it, but I didn't know it pertained to just driving.\" The incident has sparked debate over the balance between enforcing stay-at-home orders and respecting civil liberties.\n\nThe key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus, as public health officials have emphasized, is social distancing\u2014that is, staying away from interpersonal contact as much as possible. A single person sitting inside their own car is no less isolated than someone sitting alone inside their house would be. In fact, if Shaffer's story is true, the only interpersonal contact she had while driving on Sunday was with the officers who pulled her over.\n\nRyan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the state police, explained the encounter, stating, \"Troopers have been encouraged to use contacts with the public as opportunities to reinforce the necessity to abide by stay-at-home orders.\" However, at a time when \"contacts with the public\" are considered a public health risk, the police could find a better strategy.\n\nThe incident is not unique to Pennsylvania. A paddleboarder in California was arrested last week for violating the state's stay-at-home order, and in New York City, where the COVID-19 outbreak is most severe, police have been arresting people for violating social distancing orders.\n\nThe economic impact of stay-at-home orders and mandatory shutdowns is a topic of much discussion, with concerns about the immense economic damage and widespread unemployment. The question of how aggressively shutdown orders should be policed is a corollary to this discussion. While necessary to stop the spread of the disease, aggressive enforcement could potentially increase the risk of spreading disease.\n\nElizabeth Goitein, director for liberty and national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, a legal policy think tank, emphasizes the importance of policies that are driven by science, proportionate to the risks involved, and do not last any longer than necessary. She worries about the potential for increased government power and the erosion of civil liberties.\n\nPolice should not have the power to stop and question everyone who leaves their home in apparent contravention of a stay-at-home order. Even in a time when those orders are in place, the default assumption cannot become that movement is illegal unless approved by the state. The police may have a role in preventing large public gatherings and other actual violations of social distancing guidelines, but not every apparent violation of a quarantine order is a risk to other people.\n\nShaffer plans to appeal the ticket and fine. In an update, York County District Attorney Dave Sunday has announced his intention to withdraw the citation against Shaffer, stating, \"Based on the facts in this one specific case, the fact that she was on her way home, that she was by herself in her car, that she was completely cooperative. I think that prosecution from my office of this may not be in the public interest.\" As local and state governments navigate the complexities of the pandemic, striking a balance between enforcing mandatory quarantines and respecting civil liberties will remain a critical challenge.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Remarks on U.S. Gun Laws Spark Controversy During Brazil Tech Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at a tech conference in Brazil this week, former President Barack Obama addressed the issue of gun control in the United States, stating that the country has minimal regulations on the sale of weapons, including what he referred to as \"machine guns.\"\n\nThe video of Obama's remarks, which has since been removed from YouTube, was shared on Twitter and Facebook. In the speech, Obama expressed his frustration with the U.S.'s gun laws, particularly in the context of the Sandy Hook school shooting, where he was unable to assure parents that changes would be made to prevent the easy purchase of machine guns.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Sandy Hook shooter was prevented from purchasing a weapon due to existing laws and regulations in the U.S. In fact, the shooter had to steal the weapons he used, taking them from his own mother, whom he murdered first. As Hot Air's Allahpundit pointed out, it's unclear what specific regulations Obama is advocating for to prevent such scenarios, apart from a total ban and mass confiscation.\n\nFurthermore, Allahpundit also noted that Obama's portrayal of the U.S. as a lawless country in comparison to Brazil, a country with a notoriously high murder rate, is questionable. While gun laws are indeed debated extensively in the U.S., they are regulated through various state and federal laws governing purchase, sale, use, manufacture, and more.\n\nObama's remarks, which have been a staple of his public speaking style, were criticized for their lack of factual accuracy and for indulging in a common practice among American liberalism: criticizing the U.S. to foreign audiences. However, the former president's comments have sparked a renewed debate on gun control and the need for stricter regulations in the U.S.",
    " Title: \"Ebola and HIV: A Tale of Two Viruses and the Lessons We Keep Missing\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with clinical-research director Rick Elion of the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington, D.C., the parallels between the early days of the HIV/AIDS crisis and the current Ebola outbreak are drawn. Elion, who has been a long-time researcher in the field of HIV, expresses a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as he watches the public's reaction to Ebola, citing similarities in the fear, isolation, and stigmatization of those affected by the diseases.\n\nJulia Belluz, the interviewer, asks Elion about his thoughts on the public's response to Ebola in light of his experience with early HIV. Elion describes the emotions brought up by the Ebola epidemic as a \"stew of emotion\" that reminds him of the early days of HIV. He notes the tension between the desire to help and the desire to run away, a tension that he believes is at the core of the fear surrounding these diseases.\n\nElion also discusses the ineffectiveness of isolationist policies, such as quarantines and travel bans, which were tried during the HIV crisis and did not work. He argues that borders are porous and that it is better to keep them open, regulating who is moving, rather than imposing quarantines. Elion believes that such policies would be counter-productive, dissuading health care personnel from volunteering and placing unreasonable and unsustainable rules on them.\n\nIn conclusion, Elion's interview serves as a reminder of the lessons learned from the HIV/AIDS crisis and the importance of bringing humanity into the equation when responding to disease outbreaks. The interview highlights the need for empathy, understanding, and a focus on regulating rather than isolating in order to effectively combat these diseases and provide aid to those affected.",
    " Title: Bluefin-21 Resumes Search for MH370 as Questions Arise Over Search Area\n\nArticle:\n\nThe autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 has resumed its mission to locate missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, having scanned over 90% of the designated search area. However, an object found near Augusta, Australia, which was initially considered a potential lead, has been determined not to be related to the missing plane.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed that the metal object, which was found to have rivets on one side, is not from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Detailed pictures of the object were sufficient for investigators to rule it out as a lead in the search for the missing plane. The Australian agency leading the search for the aircraft made this announcement on Thursday.\n\nPreviously, the piece of metal was labeled an \"object of interest\" in the search. It was discovered near Augusta, approximately 1,000 miles away from the suspected crash site, after several days of fruitless searches for the missing plane.\n\nThe search for the missing plane, which disappeared mid-flight on March 8 with 239 people aboard, has been ongoing for 48 days. Despite the extensive search efforts, no evidence of the Boeing 777 jetliner has been found. One significant challenge in the search has been the ocean's abundance of garbage, with other objects spotted in the Indian Ocean turning out to be trash, jellyfish, and fishing gear.\n\nAs the search continues to come up empty, a key question remains: Are they searching in the right place? Steve Wang, whose mother was aboard the aircraft, expressed his concerns in an interview with CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\"\n\n\"They have been searching for more than a month. All of the ships, the planes, the satellites they're using, not even a small piece of the plane was found,\" Wang said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reaffirmed the search's continuation, stating, \"We are not going to abandon... the families of the 239 people who were on that plane by lightly surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something.\"\n\nUp to 11 military aircraft and 11 ships are set to search for the plane on Thursday. The Bluefin-21 has begun its 12th mission in the underwater search area.\n\nDespite the ongoing search efforts, there is no indication that the hunt in the southern Indian Ocean is nearing an end. In fact, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has stated that the search will continue until the search area is fully covered.\n\nMalaysian and Australian authorities are already developing a long-term strategy for the search, which could last for months or years, based on the two-year search for Air France Flight 447. If the underwater search fails to turn up evidence of the plane, it could ground the air search as well.\n\nThe next logical step after the underwater search is to \"rethink all of the information we have at hand,\" according to ocean search specialist Rob McCallum. An expanded search area might include the last 370 miles of the plane's flight path, perhaps 15 miles on either side. Deep-towed sonar, which provides less resolution than the Bluefin-21 but about 10 times the range, could also be employed.\n\nInvestigators would still prioritize finding the flight data recorders from Flight 370, as they could provide valuable insights into the jetliner's disappearance and the fate of the 239 passengers and crew on board. If found, the \"black boxes\" would likely be sent to the Australian Transport Safety Board's accident investigation lab. However, the investigation is officially Malaysian, so Malaysian officials would decide where the boxes would be sent.\n\nThe international investigation team tasked with looking into the disappearance of Flight 370 has been approved by the Malaysian Cabinet, with the team's members to be announced next week. The team will focus on evaluating and determining the cause of the accident, rather than investigating criminal aspects, which remain under the Royal Malaysian Police.\n\nMalaysia has completed a preliminary report on the incident, as required by the International Civil Aviation Organization, but has not released it publicly.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Negotiate Deficit Reduction Framework, Differences Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 45-minute meeting at the White House on Monday, President Obama and Speaker John Boehner discussed a deficit reduction framework that would raise $1 trillion over 10 years. The details of the plan will be finalized next year by Congress's tax-writing committees and the Obama administration.\n\nThe White House plan includes the permanent extension of Bush-era tax cuts for household incomes below $400,000, with the top tax bracket increasing to 39.6% from the current 35%. The change in the way inflation is calculated would slow the growth of government benefits, especially Social Security, and contribute to the $1.22 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years.\n\nThe White House proposal includes $800 billion in straight cuts, with half coming from federal health care programs, $200 billion from other mandatory programs, $100 billion from military spending, and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress's annual discretion.\n\nThe president's plan also includes fast-track procedures to help Congressional tax writers overhaul the individual and corporate tax code and make changes to other programs. However, senior Republican aides have made it clear that differences remain, particularly over the president's insistence on counting lower interest payments on the national debt as savings.\n\nThe president is also insisting on some protections for what he has called the \"most vulnerable populations,\" including not affecting wounded veterans and disabled people on Supplemental Security Income through the new inflation calculations. Additionally, he is pushing for upfront spending on infrastructure and an extension of expiring unemployment benefits.\n\nThe president's proposal would also secure some tax and policy changes long sought by both parties, such as the permanent extension of popular business tax breaks, the permanent stop of the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, and the stop of a planned and deep cut to Medicare health providers.\n\nTo avoid future fiscal showdowns, Mr. Obama wants the government's borrowing limit to rise high enough to take the issue off the table for two years, although Congress could periodically weigh in and try to override a presidential lifting of the debt ceiling, should it want to. Senior Republican aides made it clear on Monday night that the plan was not what the speaker had wanted.",
    " Title: Central American Leaders and Obama Discuss Comprehensive Plan to Address Youth Migrant Surge\n\nArticle:\n\nCentral American leaders, including the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, met with President Barack Obama at the White House on Friday to discuss a comprehensive plan to address the surge of immigrant youth from their countries entering the United States illegally. The meeting comes as Washington grapples with finding a solution to a humanitarian crisis that has become a contentious issue in the ongoing debate over U.S. immigration reform.\n\nThe Central American leaders signaled to Obama that they are working on a plan to address the root causes of the migration, with a focus on reducing crime and promoting greater social and economic opportunities. The presidents reiterated their commitment to prevent families and children from making the dangerous journey to the United States and to work together to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration.\n\nThe influx this year of tens of thousands of child immigrants, many unaccompanied, has become a partisan flashpoint in the already divisive issue of U.S. immigration reform. The Obama administration has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border efforts, while Republicans and some Democrats in Congress are resisting that proposal and offering alternatives that would spend less and change immigration policy to deport kids faster.\n\nThe Central American leaders and Obama pledged to redouble efforts to counter misinformation about U.S. deportation policy around young immigrants and to further efforts to \"humanely repatriate migrants, consistent with due process.\" The White House previously called the idea of assessing asylum claims in those countries premature, but spokesman Josh Earnest said before Friday's meeting that it could be extended to other countries if successful.\n\nThe administration and Congress have struggled to come to a consensus on how to address the surge that has overwhelmed border and immigration services. House Republicans are expected to vote on a scaled-down border bill next week that would provide less than $1 billion to address the crisis and modify a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children from Central America who enter the United States illegally. The proposal to alter that law all but ensures the bill will not come to a vote in the Senate, where Democrats are opposed to tagging that change to a funding bill of its own for the border crisis.\n\nThe administration is also considering sending National Guard troops to the border, according to a White House official, just days after Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would do just that in the Rio Grande Valley area. The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley. The number of unaccompanied minors seeping through that area has slowed dramatically since last month.",
    " Title: Rep. Al Green Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump, Focusing on Alleged Disparaging Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Al Green (D-TX) took a significant step on Wednesday by reading articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the House floor, with the President's Twitter account at the center of the allegations. However, the impeachment process is unlikely to advance given the Republican control of both the House and Senate.\n\nGreen's proposal does not aim to formally introduce the articles of impeachment at this time. Instead, he wants to give members of Congress and the public an opportunity to read them before a potential vote. In an interview, Green stated, \"I want my colleagues to read this and be informed.\"\n\nIn a 15-page document, Green accuses Trump of making disparaging remarks about NFL players, Puerto Ricans, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and former President Barack Obama. The articles of impeachment do not mention Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey or any alleged obstruction of justice.\n\nGreen argues that the Constitution does not require the commission of a crime for a president to be impeached. Instead, he believes that the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" referred to in Article II, Section IV consist of actions that may be \"denominated political.\"\n\nAmong the \"high crimes\" Trump is accused of committing are falsely claiming President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, which allegedly engendered racial antipathy; vowing to ban transgender people from the military, which \"incited bigotry\"; and calling NFL players \"sons of dogs\" by calling them \"sons of bitches.\"\n\nMost Democrats believe it is too early to advance calls for impeachment. In an interview this May, Green acknowledged that his articles of impeachment were unlikely to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Congress. Green has faced numerous death threats since first requesting charges leading to Trump's impeachment. Aides say they have received far more feedback over Green's impeachment speech alone than they have in the rest of this congressional term.\n\nGreen was in contact with the FBI for his safety. \"When you hear people say [in these recordings] that they want to murder you, that's what lynching is,\" Green told me in May. \"That sends a powerful message. No matter your station in life, there are people who believe that if you're a person of color, you can be intimidated with the threat of lynching.\"\n\nThe Conservative Review criticized Green's case as \"imbecilic\" and evidence of \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" Even Senate Democrats have resisted the approximately 20 House Democrats who have called for impeachment, with several stating that it is too early and reeks of partisanship.\n\nGreen, however, maintains that he is standing alone for what he believes is the right thing to do. \"Sometimes you have to stand alone,\" he said. \"The truest measure of a person is not where you stand in times of comfort and convenience.\"",

The letter, exclusively obtained by Megyn Kelly and shared on her Instagram account on Sunday, lists six specific questions, taking an urgent tone due to the nature of the alleged human trafficking operation.\n\nThe questions include inquiries about the interview conducted by ABC News with Epstein's victim, the network's knowledge of Epstein after the story was first presented, the individuals involved in the decision-making process, reasons for the story's non-airing, potential external forces responsible for the story's non-run, additional evidence presented to ABC News, and any communication with authorities.\n\nIn a series of Project Veritas videos released earlier this month, former ABC News reporter Amy Robach admitted that the network refused to air her chilling report on Epstein a few years ago. Robach had firsthand information from one of Epstein's accusers about his alleged molestation of women and minors. Epstein has been accused of pimping young girls and forcing them to have sex with hundreds of men.\n\nMcCarthy expressed his regret, stating, \"ABC News chose to bury the truth.\" In a separate development, Kelly scored another exclusive a few weeks back, interviewing former ABC News producer Ashley Bianco, who was fired by CBS for reportedly leaking the video clip of Robach criticizing ABC News for nixing her Epstein story. Bianco claimed she did not leak the video to Project Veritas, leaving open the question: Did CBS fire the wrong person? According to Project Veritas's James O'Keefe, the real leaker is still at ABC.\n\nABC News has denied reports that they killed Robach's story. The network has yet to respond to McCarthy's letter.",
    " Title: Partisan Tone Sets Early Agenda for 114th Congress as Obama Issues Veto Threats and Democrats Launch Filibuster\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 114th Congress, barely a week old, has seen a contentious start as President Obama has issued veto threats on three measures and Democratic leaders have vowed to support him. The veto threats have been met with resistance from both sides, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stating that her party will vote to uphold the vetoes.\n\nIn a swift move, Senate Democrats launched a filibuster on the third day of business, blocking the Keystone XL pipeline legislation, which has bipartisan support. The filibuster, the fastest on record, came on a bill that has six Democratic co-sponsors and the support of 54 Senate Republicans. Despite this, Democrats refused to allow debate to begin without going through all procedural hoops, a practice they had criticized when Republicans were in the minority last year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that the Senate will work through the process to get bipartisan jobs legislation on the president's desk as soon as possible. President Obama has issued a veto threat on the Keystone measure, as well as a bill to repeal Obamacare's 30-hour workweek definition and legislation that includes a two-year delay of Dodd-Frank financial reform regulations.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-WV), a Keystone supporter, believes enough Democrats could rally behind the project for the Senate to override an Obama veto. However, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-OH) criticized Obama for issuing veto threats so early in the congressional session, stating that he could have waited a few days.\n\nThe reliance on the veto and Mr. Obama's eagerness to issue threats has already created a tense atmosphere on Capitol Hill. As Republicans blame Democrats for blocking action, Democrats counter that Republicans are adopting tactics they fought when they were in the minority. The Keystone bill is expected to come up for a vote again next week, with the filibuster vote likely to occur on Monday. The previous record for a filibuster was a Republican filibuster at the beginning of the 111th Congress in 2009, which happened on the fourth day.",
    " Title: U.S., Allies Accuse Iran of Attacks on Oil Tankers, Tensions Escalate in Gulf of Oman\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of attacks on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz last week, the Trump administration has accused Iran of carrying out the attacks and has kept all options on the table, including military strikes, in response.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the attacks were conducted with the clear intent to deny transit through the strait, through which about a fifth of the world's oil is transported daily. The Pentagon released photographs and a grainy black-and-white video on Thursday, purportedly showing Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from one of the oil tankers.\n\nU.S. Central Command stated that American forces in the region witnessed and recorded an Iranian boat approaching the oil tanker Kokuka Courageous and removing an unexploded limpet mine from the side of the vessel. The video footage released by the Defense Department appears to show a small device being removed from the ship.\n\nMr. Pompeo said the U.S. intelligence community has significant evidence to blame Tehran for the attacks, with Iran persistently denying such claims. U.S. officials have also pointed to the use of limpet mines in a May attack on four oil tankers, which the Trump administration has also blamed on Iran.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced by the U.S. take on the situation. Germany's foreign minister has requested additional evidence before pointing blame on Tehran, stating that the video released by the Pentagon is not enough to draw conclusions. The Japanese owner of one of the tankers has told of his crew's account of the incident and said the ship was hit by a flying object, not a mine.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, and Britain have joined the U.S. in pointing fingers at Iran. In an interview with Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called on other countries to take a \"decisive stand\" against the attack. Britain plans to send elite military forces to the region in response to the attacks, with Royal Marines scheduled to be deployed to the region in coming weeks and expected to patrol the strait.\n\nAs tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran, Mr. Pompeo maintained that the U.S. does not seek war with Iran but will defend itself if necessary. The Trump administration has repeated that message for weeks since the Pentagon deployed additional forces to the region last month, citing a threat to American interests.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. is considering a \"full range of options\" to respond to the attacks but is \"confident [the U.S.] can take a set of actions that would restore deterrence.\" Asked whether such action would include a military response, the secretary of state responded, \"Of course.\"\n\nLawmakers in recent weeks have warned that the administration lacks congressional approval to use military force. Mr. Pompeo on Sunday insisted that the administration \"always [has] the authorization to defend American interests.\" Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have said the White House cannot cite the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to strike in the Middle East and have reiterated that only Congress can declare war.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in an appearance on CBS that while he believes Iran is behind the attacks, \"congressional approval is necessary to initiate hostilities against Iran.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who sits on the Senate intelligence and Armed Services committees, said retaliatory military strikes against Iran would be warranted. \"Unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" Mr. Cotton said on CBS after Mr. Pompeo's appearance. Mr. Cotton said he believes the administration does have the authority to use military action against Iran without expressed congressional approval.",
    " Title: Tensions Escalate Between North and South Korea, Israel Launches Airstrikes Against Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape is heating up as North Korea and South Korea engage in a series of escalating tensions, while Israel launches airstrikes against Syria. Here's what you need to know.\n\nOn August 4, two South Korean soldiers were wounded in a landmine explosion in the demilitarized zone, for which the South blamed the North. This incident marked the most significant exchange of fire between the two countries in five years. The North, in response, has ordered its military units into a \"semi-war state\" with South Korea.\n\nIn retaliation, the South began broadcasting propaganda in the demilitarized zone, a practice that was common but agreed to stop in 2004. The North has demanded that the South end this loudspeaker propaganda by Saturday afternoon, or else face an attack from the North; the South has rejected the ultimatum.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel launched two rounds of airstrikes against the Syrian military and allied militant groups in Syria on Thursday and Friday, in response to rocket attacks at the Golan Heights. Israel claims that the rocket attack was conducted by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad and coordinated by Iran, which backs the Syrian government in the country's civil war.\n\nThe Israeli government is already connecting the rocket attacks to the Iran nuclear deal, with Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon alleging the rocket strikes were a \"preview of a richer and more murderous Iran\" after sanctions are lifted. The income models of these six artists are a good guide to how the economics of art are changing.\n\nIt is important to note that brinkmanship like this between the North and South has happened for decades without escalating into war. For more information, see Zack Beauchamp's explainer. This article is a neutral, factual, and informative account of the current political tensions between North and South Korea and Israel's airstrikes against Syria.",
    " Title: \"Congressional Report Reveals High Number of Discretionary Releases of Criminal Immigrants by ICE in 2014\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the House Judiciary Committee has revealed that most of the illegal immigrant criminals released from custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last year were released due to the agency's discretion, not due to court rulings or lack of resources.\n\nAccording to the report, obtained by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, over 17,000 of the criminal aliens released last year were released due to ICE's discretion, representing 57 percent of the releases. This contradicts the claims made by ICE officials that their hands are tied by court rulings in many cases.\n\nThe report shows that more than 3,700 \"Threat Level 1\" criminals, who are deemed the top priority for deportation, were still released out into the community even as they waited for their immigration cases to be heard.\n\nIn a statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588, ICE said it takes release decisions seriously and makes a judgment in each case. However, the report indicates that 57 percent of the releases were made at ICE's discretion, and they could have been kept in detention instead.\n\n\"Put aside the spin, and the fact is that over 17,000 of the criminal aliens released last year were released due to ICE discretion, representing 57 percent of the releases,\" said Mr. Goodlatte. \"The Obama administration's lax enforcement policies are reckless and needlessly endanger our communities.\"\n\nICE officials insist that those who are released are still monitored, often by electronic ankle bracelets but also through a system of phone checks or by paying a bond. However, nearly all of those released under electronic monitoring broke the terms of their release, according to ICE numbers.\n\nIn fiscal year 2014, ICE put about 41,000 immigrants through electronic monitoring, and more than 30,000 of them broke the terms of their release\u2014many of them racking up multiple violations. All told, they notched nearly 300,000 violations in one year alone, or an average of 10 instances per violator.\n\nThe rate has gone down slightly so far in fiscal year 2015. Of the 34,002 immigrants put into electronic monitoring, 27,317 have broken the rules a combined 162,322 times.\n\nICE said violations can include what they deem minor problems, such as someone lacking a strong enough cell signal for voice verification by phone or someone calling in too early or a few minutes late. Low batteries or jostling an electronic bracelet during sports can also cause a monitoring alarm to go off incorrectly, ICE said.\n\nOf the more than 30,000 detainees who broke the conditional terms of their release and monitoring in 2014, only 2,420 were deemed to have been serious enough breaches to rearrest them.\n\nPart of ICE's problem is that it doesn't have enough beds to go out and pick up violators, according to an inspector general's report released earlier this year. Agency officials said they would like to be able to hold those who willfully break the rules, but they haven't requested more beds. Indeed, Mr. Obama's 2016 budget request actually asked for fewer beds to hold detainees next year, arguing that he wants to put more emphasis on the very alternatives that are being violated.\n\nThe treatment of those awaiting their deportation proceedings has been controversial for several years. In 2013, the agency released 36,007 convicted criminals who were awaiting the outcome of their deportation cases. Those released had amassed 116 homicide convictions, 15,635 drunken driving convictions, and 9,187 convictions stemming from what ICE labeled involvement with \"dangerous drugs.\"\n\nThe total dropped to about 30,000 in 2014\u2014but the seriousness of the offenses increased, with 193 homicide convictions among the detainees and 16,070 drunken driving convictions. There were also 426 sexual assaults and 303 kidnapping convictions, ICE said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and ICE Director Sarah Saldana said the numbers were unacceptable and imposed new rules requiring releases to be vetted by senior agency officials to make sure they were correct. Both Mr. Johnson and Ms. Saldana also said many of the releases are required and give them little discretion\u2014particularly those made under a 2001 Supreme Court decision known as the Zadvydas case, when the justices ruled that immigrants couldn't generally be detained indefinitely.\n\nThat means that if a home country won't take someone back, ICE must release them after about six months. However, the new numbers obtained by Mr. Goodlatte suggest Zadvydas-related releases were fewer than 2,500 in 2014, or only about 8 percent of the total\u2014compared to the 57 percent that ICE admits were completely discretionary. The rest of the releases were divided between cases where an immigration judge ordered bond or where ICE was unable to obtain travel documents but it wasn't considered a mandatory release under the Zadvydas ruling.",
    " Title: Journalistic Perspective: The Current State of the U.S. Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the final stretch of the 2016 U.S. Presidential race unfolds, the narrative surrounding the election has shifted significantly, with many pundits and media outlets suggesting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is coasting towards victory, while Republican candidate Donald Trump is facing an uphill battle. However, it is crucial to approach such assertions with caution, as the race remains unpredictable.\n\nThe recent third debate, polls, and various events have contributed to the Trump-is-sinking narrative. The candidate's refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome during the third debate has raised concerns among political analysts and Republican leaders. This sentiment is reflected in headlines such as \"A wave of apprehension and anguish swept the Republican Party\" and \"Donald Trump is in a funk: Bitter, hoarse and pondering, \u2018If I lose...\u2019\"\n\nPolling data and prognostication stories also suggest a favorable position for Clinton. According to Politico, even if Trump wins all the remaining battleground states, he would still fall short of the White House if he cannot flip another state where Clinton currently leads in the polls. The six states where Clinton is currently leading show signs of swing states that have traditionally been competitive.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the outliers in the polling data, such as the Los Angeles Times poll that calls the race a tie and an IBD poll that gives Trump a 2-point lead. The race will likely be decided in states like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, and a handful of others.\n\nIn light of the ongoing election, it is crucial to maintain a neutral perspective and recognize that the race remains unpredictable. As Yogi Berra once said, \"It ain't over till it's over.\" With less than three weeks to go, the 2016 U.S. Presidential race continues to captivate the nation and the world.",
    " Title: U.S. and Romanian Soldiers, Civilians Killed in Taliban Suicide Bombing in Kabul\n\nA Taliban suicide bombing in the center of Kabul on Thursday has resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier, a Romanian service member, and at least 10 civilians near the American embassy. The incident occurred near the headquarters of Afghanistan's international military force and the American embassy.\n\nThe American and Romanian service members were both NATO soldiers, according to the NATO Resolute Support mission. The American soldier was the fourth killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack, the second major one this week, has raised concerns about the U.S.-Taliban deal on ending America's longest war. President Ashraf Ghani, whose government has been shut out of the U.S.-Taliban talks, stated that \"peace with a group that is still killing innocent people is meaningless.\"\n\nA total of 42 people were wounded in the attack, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi. Surveillance footage showed the bomber's vehicle turning into a checkpoint and exploding, and a passer-by trying to sprint away just seconds before the blast.\n\nThe Taliban claimed they targeted vehicles of \"foreigners\" trying to enter the heavily guarded Shashdarak area where Afghan national security authorities have offices. British soldiers at the scene retrieved what appeared to be the remains of a NATO vehicle.\n\nThe violence continued hours later when the Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bombing outside an Afghan military base in the Logar provincial capital, Puli Alam, with local officials saying four civilians were killed and 11 others wounded.\n\nThe Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission also confirmed that its acting leader in Ghor province, Abdul Samad Amiri, had been kidnapped by the Taliban while traveling and shot dead late on Wednesday.\n\nThe especially violent week comes as U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is in Kabul briefing Ghani and other Afghan leaders on the U.S.-Taliban deal to end nearly 18 years of fighting. The Afghan government has raised serious concerns about the deal, including in new comments on Thursday as the latest Kabul bombing occurred.\n\nThe agreement was moving with \"excessive speed,\" presidential adviser Waheed Omer told reporters, warning of difficult days ahead. \"Afghans have been bitten by this snake before,\" Omer said, recalling past agreements from which the Afghan government has been sidelined. \"Where there is no feeling of ownership, there is no safety.\"\n\nThe Taliban, at their strongest since their 2001 defeat by a U.S.-led invasion, have refused to negotiate with the government, calling it a U.S. puppet. The U.S. hopes its deal with the Taliban will bring the militant group to the table for intra-Afghan talks to begin ahead of Afghanistan's presidential election on Sept. 28.\n\nThe Afghan government has said it shares the concerns raised this week by several former U.S. ambassadors to Afghanistan. They warned that a full U.S. troop withdrawal that moves too quickly and without requiring the Taliban to meet certain conditions, such as reducing violence, could lead to \"total civil war\" such as the one that engulfed the country in the 1990s after a rapid Soviet pullout and before the Taliban swept into power.\n\nThe U.S. seeks Taliban guarantees that they will not allow Afghanistan to become a haven from which extremist groups such as al-Qaida and the local affiliate of the Islamic State group can launch global attacks. The Afghan president, who has been shown the U.S.-Taliban deal but not allowed to keep a copy, has insisted that this month's election be held on time. He seeks a second term and a strong mandate to negotiate with the militant group on the country's political future. He rejects talk of an interim government, an idea that has gained such traction among Afghans that many other presidential candidates have barely campaigned.\n\nGhani's adviser, Omer, acknowledged on Thursday the risks of holding another chaotic election after Afghanistan's presidential one in 2014 and last year's parliamentary vote. This election must happen on time, he said, but said a vote that is not transparent will \"cause challenges.\"",
    " Title: Rosenstein Expected to Depart DOJ as Barr Confirmation Nears; Mueller Investigation to Continue Under New Attorney General\n\nArticle:\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has overseen the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, is expected to leave the Department of Justice (DOJ) within weeks. According to CNN and ABC News, Rosenstein has informed President Donald Trump of his plans to depart following the confirmation of Attorney General nominee William Barr.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, during a Wednesday interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" all but confirmed the move, stating that Rosenstein \"has always planned to roughly stay around two years.\" Sanders added that there is no intention by the president or the White House to push him out, and she suspects Rosenstein is \"making room\" for Barr to build his own team.\n\nBarr's confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee are scheduled for next week. Sources told The Washington Post that there are no firm plans for Rosenstein's departure or a timeline, and NBC News reported that Rosenstein won't leave until Mueller submits his final report.\n\nRosenstein's tenure as deputy attorney general has been marked by controversy, particularly after The New York Times reported late last year that he discussed secretly taping the president and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Trump has often criticized the DOJ and the FBI over the investigation, calling it a \"witch hunt\" and accusing the departments of bias against him.\n\nIf confirmed, Barr would take over for Matthew Whitaker, who is currently overseeing the Mueller probe as acting attorney general. Trump forced the resignation of Jeff Sessions, the first attorney general, in November and appointed Sessions's chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general.\n\nRosenstein's departure would come as the Mueller investigation continues, with Mueller expected to submit his final report soon. The investigation has been ongoing since May 2017, and its findings are eagerly anticipated by both sides of the political aisle.",
    " Title: Trump-Kim Summit: Bolton Suggests Denuclearization Progress in a Year, but Concerns Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" National Security Advisor John R. Bolton expressed optimism that significant steps toward North Korea's denuclearization could be achieved within a year. However, administration officials have reportedly maintained that North Korea is unlikely to completely abandon its nuclear program.\n\nThe question remains whether North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is genuinely committed to a change in course or is merely buying time with President Donald Trump, as his predecessors were during their interactions with the past four U.S. presidents.\n\nFrustrated by reports suggesting North Korea's continued advancements despite its denuclearization pledge, President Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday, boasting about the lack of rocket launches or nuclear testing in the past eight months. He claimed that the entire Asian region was thrilled, while only his opposition, including the media, was complaining.\n\nIn a Trumpian manner, he added, \"If not for me, we would now be at war with North Korea.\"\n\nWhile Trump's statement is partially accurate, as there have indeed been no missile or nuclear tests since November, it's crucial to distinguish between a freeze and denuclearization. North Korea retains all its nuclear capabilities and can resume testing at any time. This was a concern even when Rex W. Tillerson, then the Secretary of State, described this position as insufficient because it merely maintained the ability to strike, a capability that Trump, until recently, characterized as intolerable.\n\nThe current situation also highlights Trump's tendency to equate a good meeting with a good outcome. It is akin to President John F. Kennedy declaring the Cold War over after his first meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961, when the Cuban missile crisis erupted 16 months later.\n\nKim Jong-un, too, has achieved something. The tension has significantly decreased, and the United States has unilaterally suspended military exercises with South Korea.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 8: A Turning Point in the Battle for Same-Sex Marriage Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday regarding Proposition 8, the California measure that bans same-sex marriage, supporters and opponents alike agreed on one thing: this is a watershed moment.\n\nFor Nowlin Haltom, a real estate agent in Studio City, California, the hearing marks a significant milestone in a long-fought battle. Haltom, who married his partner of 15 years in New York two years ago, has been an active participant in the fight for same-sex marriage rights.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, views the Supreme Court's consideration of Proposition 8 as an attempt to redefine marriage, a concept that he argues has been consistent throughout human history.\n\nThe potential outcomes from Tuesday's arguments range from the case being dismissed to a broad ruling on whether or not there is a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. According to Rebecca Brown, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of law, the justices will now sort through the arguments and a decision is expected by early June.\n\nHaltom, a Vietnam veteran, is hopeful that the court will rule in favor of same-sex marriage, but he anticipates a more narrow decision. He expresses concern about the implications of the case on his own relationship, as his husband would not be entitled to his Social Security check upon his death.\n\nA Prop. 8 rally held at Los Angeles City Hall on Sunday drew a relatively small crowd, with only 350 supporters in attendance. Haltom questions the turnout, given the city's size, and suggests that there is still work to be done in educating the next generation of activists.\n\nMeanwhile, Wildmon argues that a broad Supreme Court ruling in support of same-sex marriage would contradict the majority opinion in America, where more than 50 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage but 31 states have defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman.\n\nPaul Linton, special counsel at The Thomas More Society, a national anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage advocacy group in Chicago, suggests that a broad ruling could lead to some states calling for a constitutional amendment, potentially requiring Congress to convene a convention. Linton notes that such a convention has not been used in U.S. history since the original Constitutional Convention of 1789, but if two-thirds of the states demanded it, it could happen.",
    " Title: Cost Analysis of Various Universal Healthcare Plans in the U.S.: A Comprehensive Look at Medicare for All, Enhanced Medicare-for-All, Lite Medicare-for-All, and a Mixed Public-Private Model\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, the debate on healthcare reform in the United States continues to gain momentum. With Democrats advocating for various methods to expand access to healthcare and President Trump promising a future \"phenomenal\" plan, significant changes are expected in the U.S. health care system.\n\nOn Tuesday, the leading Democratic presidential candidates discussed the merits of Medicare for All during a debate, but this is just one of several options under consideration by lawmakers and policy experts. On Wednesday, a team of researchers from the Urban Institute released a study examining different plans for reform.\n\nThe study found that it is possible to achieve universal healthcare without disrupting the current system or causing a dramatic increase in federal expenditures. The researchers analyzed four different plans: Medicare for All, an enhanced Medicare-for-All plan, a lite Medicare-for-All plan, and a mixed public-private model.\n\nMedicare for All, as proposed, would cost $34 trillion over 10 years. An enhanced Medicare-for-All plan, which would cover everyone in the country (including undocumented immigrants) and offer more benefits than the current system, such as dental, vision, hearing, and long-term services and supports, would raise national spending on healthcare by nearly $3 trillion in 2020 and $34 trillion, or $32 trillion after tax offsets, over 10 years. Employer spending on healthcare would decrease by $955 billion, and household spending would fall by $887 billion, but $2.7 trillion in additional federal revenue would be needed to finance the new program.\n\nAn enhanced Medicare-for-All plan would cost nearly $3 trillion in 2020 and $34 trillion over 10 years. Employer spending on healthcare would decrease by $955 billion, and household spending would fall by $887 billion, but $2.7 trillion in additional federal revenue would be needed to finance the new program. A lite Medicare-for-All plan, which would cover all legal residents in the U.S. but not the 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in the country, would cost roughly $17.6 trillion over 10 years. This plan would reduce national spending on healthcare by about $209 billion in 2020. Federal spending would increase by $1.5 trillion in the first year, but total health-care spending would fall by about $210 billion as a result of lower provider payment rates and administrative savings.\n\nA plan that includes some out-of-pocket expenses based on income and a less generous set of expanded benefits would cost about half of the enhanced version. This plan, which would cover all legal residents in the U.S. but not the 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in the country, would reduce national spending on healthcare by about $209 billion in 2020. Federal spending would increase by $1.5 trillion in the first year, but total health-care spending would fall by about $210 billion as a result of lower provider payment rates and administrative savings.\n\nMedicare for All isn't the only path to universal coverage. One of the plans in the report, involving a mix of private and public health insurance, would cover everyone in the U.S. except for 6.6 million undocumented immigrants. The plan would beef up Obamacare subsidies, expand Medicaid to all states, provide a public option, and cap payment rates. Federal spending would increase by $122.1 billion if implemented next year and by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, but total national health spending would fall by $22.6 billion in 2020.\n\nSara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, which funded the study, said that the report shows that universal health care coverage \"can be reached in different ways\" \u2013 and, we should add, with very different costs. The study provides a valuable resource for policymakers and the public as they consider the various options for healthcare reform in the U.S.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Shift in Voter Trends: Record Republican Turnout in Primary Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, more than 240,000 new Democrats and independents participated in Virginia's Republican presidential primary this week, marking a significant shift in the political landscape. This trend is echoed in other major states, with over 535,000 new Democrats and independents in Texas, 175,000 in Georgia, 172,000 in Tennessee, and 143,000 in Alabama, according to a comprehensive analysis of exit polling data compared to the 2008 primary elections.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican front-runner, has attributed this surge in Republican voter registration to his campaign efforts. In a triumphant speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared, \"We have expanded the Republican Party.\" He further stated, \"They were never going to switch, and they all switched. And they were independents. And we've actually expanded the party.\"\n\nExit polling data supports Mr. Trump's claim, with nearly 10 million people casting ballots in the 15 primaries and caucuses so far, representing about 4 million more votes than in the same Republican races in 2008. Mr. Trump has garnered approximately a third of the votes, building a formidable and diverse coalition that spans moderates and evangelicals, draws heavily from self-identified independents, and skews toward older and less-educated supporters.\n\nThe success of Mr. Trump and his fellow candidates is evident in the record-breaking turnout in 14 out of the 15 Republican contests so far. In contrast, Democratic turnout has plummeted in every race except Colorado's caucuses, with overall Democratic turnout down more than 30% compared to the 2008 primary elections. In 2008, Democrats accounted for 62% of all votes cast, but this year, they account for only 41%.\n\nDemocrats attribute the discrepancy to the larger Republican field, which had 12 candidates in Iowa compared to the Democrats' three. In the Super Tuesday races, Republicans had five candidates, while the Democrats were down to two: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest countered that the Democratic turnout is strong, particularly in key battleground states for the general election. He stated, \"I think this is an indication that there is ample enthusiasm on the Democratic side, particularly in the places where it matters most in the general election.\"\n\nThe Virginia primary was a notable exception, with Republicans outperforming Democrats in nearly every region, including suburban swing counties such as Loudoun and Prince William in the Washington region, Henrico, on the outskirts of Richmond, and Chesapeake, in the southeast.\n\nWhile some attribute the massive Republican turnout to hostility toward Donald Trump, party leaders are optimistic about the overall turnout's impact on the November elections. John Findlay, executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, stated, \"Nearly 240,000 more voters chose to cast a ballot for Republican candidates versus Hillary or Bernie.\"\n\nThe shift in voter trends is a significant development in the 2016 primary elections, with the Republican Party experiencing a surge in support from Democrats and independents. The impact of this trend on the general election remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election: Collective Bargaining Issue Sidelined as Democrats Focus on Ethical Questions and Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the June 5 recall election in Wisconsin, the contentious issue of collective bargaining rights, which sparked the state's historic civil war and national debate, has taken a back seat. The issue, once a central focus of the political landscape, has been largely ignored in campaign speeches, political advertisements, and debates.\n\nDemocratic nominee, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has distanced himself from the labor movement's preferred candidate, former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, who pledged to veto the next state budget unless it restored public employees' collective-bargaining rights. Barrett, who defeated Falk in the May primary, has refused to commit to such a maneuver, although he supports restoring collective-bargaining rights using other tactics.\n\nThis strategy allows Barrett to deflect charges that he is doing the bidding of organized labor and may help him garner support from independent voters who are not particularly fond of unions. However, it may hurt him and other Democrats in their final push to get voters to the polls in a race that could hinge on turnout.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has criticized the Democrats for shying away from the collective-bargaining debate, calling it a \"dead dog loser\" for the left. Instead, Barrett has been focusing on ethical questions surrounding a John Doe criminal probe that has led to the indictment of several former Walker aides, as well as job creation.\n\nBarrett's latest series of ads have focused on the John Doe investigation and job creation, rather than labor rights. This shift in focus may indicate a strategic move to appeal to a broader electorate and to capitalize on the ethical questions surrounding the governor's administration. The outcome of the recall election remains uncertain, but the sidelining of the collective-bargaining issue is a notable development in the Wisconsin political landscape.",
    " Title: White House Response to Las Vegas and New York City Tragedies Compared: Differences in Tone and Policy Discussion\n\nIn the span of a month, two tragic events occurred in the United States, resulting in a combined death toll of 66 individuals and over 500 injuries. The first, on October 1 in Las Vegas, saw a U.S.-born white man take the lives of 58 people, while the second, on October 31 in New York City, was perpetrated by an immigrant from Uzbekistan. The response from the White House, and the subsequent discussion of policy changes, varied significantly between these two incidents.\n\nOn October 2, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about the possibility of pursuing tighter gun laws following the Las Vegas shooting. Sanders responded, \"Today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost. Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with all of those individuals. There's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country. There is currently an open and ongoing law enforcement investigation. A motive is yet to be determined, and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we do not fully know all the facts or what took place last night.\"\n\nIn contrast, on October 31, following the New York City incident, President Donald Trump tweeted about ISIS before offering \"thoughts, condolences, and prayers.\" He then went on to tweet that \"I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!\"\n\nWhen asked if October 2 was \"a time when this should not be a political discussion, it should be a policy discussion,\" Sanders replied, \"today is more, again, like I said, a day of reflection, a day of mourning, a day of gratefulness for those that were saved. And I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place, but that's not the place that we're in at this moment.\"\n\nBarely 24 hours after the New York City incident, on November 1, Trump was attacking Senator Chuck Schumer for sponsoring a bipartisan immigration plan in 1990 and calling for a change to immigration policy. October 2 was \"a day of mourning, a time of bringing our country together.\" November 1 was a day of promoting division, apparently.\n\nThe White House's response to the two tragedies, and the subsequent discussion of policy changes, appears to have been influenced by the perpetrator's nationality and the timing of the events. The Las Vegas shooting, perpetrated by an American-born individual, was met with a call for unity and a reluctance to discuss policy changes, while the New York City incident, perpetrated by an immigrant, saw a more direct call for policy changes and political attacks on individual politicians.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Hesitant to Endorse Trump and Carson Amidst Questions of Electability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Republican presidential race, front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson have yet to receive endorsements from Capitol Hill lawmakers despite their agendas being popular with voters. This reluctance to endorse the two outsider candidates has affected Republican lawmakers of all stripes, from establishment stalwarts to renegade tea partyers.\n\nWhen asked about the lack of endorsements, most lawmakers attribute it to it being too early in the race or having too many candidates to choose from, rather than the candidates being too far outside the mainstream. However, some Republicans have expressed doubts about Trump's ability to win the presidency or perform the job if elected.\n\nRep. Trent Franks (Arizona) and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who has endorsed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, stated, \"Whoever our nominee is, I will strongly support. I am hopeful that we support someone who is eminently electable like a Mike Huckabee or [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio, or there are several others there. Carson I think is wonderful and could be very electable.\"\n\nRep. John Fleming (Louisiana), another Freedom Caucus member, expressed concerns about Trump's broad statements and lack of specific policy details, particularly regarding foreign policy. \"We just have to be careful. I want to know more about what does Donald Trump want to do with our foreign policy, other than saying that he is a tough negotiator against China and other places. I want to actually know what he intends to do in Afghanistan and Iraq and places like that. I really don't know what he intends to do,\" he said.\n\nThe Carson campaign has deliberately chosen not to solicit endorsements from any governors, senators, or congressmen. Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts stated, \"Political endorsements will come in due time. They are not a priority for our campaign attention.\"\n\nFor Trump, the lack of endorsements contrasts with his strong stance on issues such as cracking down on illegal immigration and negotiating tougher trade deals with China. Sen. Jeff Sessions (Alabama) supports Trump's positions on these issues, stating, \"Those are two issues to me that working Americans care about, and this Washington establishment of both parties seem [s] to fail to grasp.\"\n\nOther GOP contenders have managed to pick up endorsements on Capitol Hill, with Sen. Rand Paul being endorsed by eight congressmen and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian whom Paul backed in a tough 2014 reelection race. Jeb Bush collected the most endorsements in Congress with three current senators and 23 current House members.\n\nDespite lingering policy questions and doubts about electability, voters continue to boost Trump and Carson to the top of the polls. In a nationwide poll of likely GOP voters released by Quinnipiac University, Trump and Carson were neck and neck at 24% and 23%, respectively. The next-closest candidates were Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas with 13% and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with 8%.\n\nRep. Alexander X.

    " Title: Frustration Mounts as DHS Fails to Provide Details on Immigration Detainee Release\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions are rising between state and federal authorities as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) remains vague about the release of immigration detainees in preparation for the ongoing sequester. The announcement that illegal immigrants would be freed from detention centers to save money has only yielded the response that \"hundreds have been released across the country.\" Lawmakers and local officials in border states are demanding more specific information, including the number of detainees released, the involved detention centers, and the cost savings goal.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, has demanded answers from ICE Director John Morton by March 6. In a letter to Morton, McCaul expressed concern that the releases were undertaken without notifying the appropriate Congressional oversight committees.\n\nIn a letter to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Paul Babeu also demanded answers. Babeu, who was inexplicably left out of the loop, stated that protocol and logic should have required him, as the top law enforcement official in the county where the releases occurred, to be notified.\n\nWhile Babeu was not informed, his colleagues in El Paso and San Diego, both highly active border regions, were. El Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles was informed by ICE of their plans, but still does not know how many detainees have been released this week.\n\nSan Diego County Sheriff William Gore was also made aware of ICE's plans in his region and, like Wiles, expressed no concerns over the move. The El Paso and San Diego Sheriff's Offices, however, clarified that they do not enforce federal immigration law.\n\nA forewarning of the current release policy emerged from a letter Napolitano sent to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the Committee on Appropriations, on Jan. 31. In the letter, Napolitano stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not be able to sustain current detention and removal operations or maintain the 34,000 detention beds mandated by Congress. This would significantly roll back progress that resulted in record-high removals.\n\nThere is also concern about the prospect of cutbacks in Border Patrol agents along the border, which could affect progress made in recent years. Napolitano told Mikulski that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would not be able to maintain current staffing levels of Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers as mandated by Congress. This could increase wait times at airports, affect security between land ports of entry, affect CBP's ability to collect revenue owed to the Federal Government, and slow screening and entry programs for those traveling into the United States.\n\nA freshman Congressman who knows the U.S.-Mexico border firsthand says the recent decision by the DHS to release low-risk detainees may actually be a solution to a festering problem. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) of El Paso, Texas, who sits on the House Committee on Homeland Security with McCaul, told FoxNews.com there is bi-partisan agreement that there are too many people being detained in ICE facilities that do not belong there. O'Rourke believes the decision this week by Napolitano to release low-risk detainees as a cost-saving measure may be a harbinger for where the federal immigration policy should be heading.\n\n\"The detention centers are a horribly broken element of our immigration policy,\" O'Rourke said. \"These people being released are not serious criminals and do not pose a threat to the United States.\"",
    " Title: \"Obama's Health Care Reform and the Supreme Court Ruling: A Test of Presidential Legacy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of President Barack Obama's health care reform, a sense of uncertainty hangs over the White House. Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, has suggested that if the president loses both the legal battle and his re-election, the law's defeat could be seen as the reason for his loss of the presidency.\n\nThe day the ruling is announced, a former Obama adviser is reported to have joked, \"I might have to clean out my sock drawer.\" The administration, according to reports, is in a state of quiet acceptance, a stage that might be called \"Living Without Universal Coverage.\"\n\nFormer advisers are emphasizing the aspects of the bill that are not connected to the mandate, such as the subsidies to buy insurance. Some aides argue that losing the mandate could be a political boon, as it would remove the core complaint against the law from the Republicans.\n\nHowever, this position is uncomfortable for a deeper reason. It goes to the core of who President Obama wanted to be as president. Earlier in his term, he refused every chance to settle for a more limited health care overhaul, making epic sacrifices to win something far broader.\n\nBefore he became president, critics said that Mr. Obama's greatest achievement was his own rise, that he played it safe rather than taking risks for what he really believed. Early in the presidential race, Mr. Obama summoned the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for a conversation about Abraham Lincoln. He was only an upstart candidate, but he was already talking about leaving a legacy, about accomplishing vast things.\n\nIn the White House, many of his top advisers, including Vice President Joe Biden and his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, counseled Mr. Obama against a sweeping health care overhaul. By summer 2009, with the country still stunned by the economic crisis and Republicans falsely raising the specter of death panels, some aides practically begged the president to scale back, take interim steps, and move on to other issues.\n\nMr. Obama did not relent. He had an economic rationale for stabilizing a dysfunctional health system, but he also \"saw what Teddy called the moral issue,\" Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's widow, said in an interview, referring to her husband. For those who wondered what Mr. Obama really believed in, universal health coverage seemed to be the answer.\n\nAs the brutal fight continued, the president sacrificed more and more in its name: an overhaul of energy and environmental laws, greater focus on economic issues, some of his own popularity, and that of House Democrats, who eventually lost their hard-won majority.\n\nIf the court strikes down the mandate and Mr. Obama wins in November, he could face one last version of his perpetual choice on health care: would he settle, learning to live with a sharply edited law? Or would he expend yet more precious capital on health care?\n\nThe final result on health care will help determine whether Mr. Obama is the game-changing president he aspired to be. \"This is his singular policy achievement,\" said Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University who wrote a brief supporting the law. \"So there's a palpable pain in having this go down.\"",
    " Title: \"Bipartisan 'Gang of Eight' in Senate Makes Progress on Immigration Reform\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisanship, a group of eight senators, colloquially known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" have been meeting in private several times a week to discuss temporary workers and border security as part of their efforts to overhaul the nation's complex immigration laws. This group, which includes Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), is considered the best hope for immigration reform in years.\n\nThe group, known for its ability to work together despite including some of the Senate's most prominent personalities, has been making significant progress, even as the deadline for the release of their sweeping legislation approaches. The progress is remarkable, considering the group includes senators with high political profiles, some of whom are potential presidential candidates, face re-election challenges, or are embroiled in scandals.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, who is up for re-election next year and may face a primary challenge from the right, described the experience as \"one of the best experiences I've had.\" He added, \"It's sort of what I came up here to do -- sit down with serious people to solve serious and hard problems.\"\n\nThe meetings, which take place for an hour or an hour-and-a-half on days when the Senate is in session, are held in a confidential manner, with no reporters present and aides standing or sitting in the background. The group is meticulous about avoiding leaks and is tight-lipped about the details of their discussions.\n\nSenators McCain and Schumer often take the lead in the meetings, but others, such as Menendez, who has focused on family reunification, and Durbin, who has championed the cause of illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, speak up when issues of special importance arise. Graham and Schumer have been working together to help broker an agreement between business and labor over a program to bring future workers to the country, a challenge that several lawmakers have identified as the most difficult aspect of the reform.\n\nThe mood in the meetings varies, with moments of lightheartedness and seriousness. McCain is known for his jovial nature, often ribbing his colleagues. Schumer appears to have developed a genuine fondness for both McCain and Graham. The sessions provide a respite from the budget fights that have consumed Congress much of the year, with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) describing the meetings as \"an oasis from the fights over the budget.\"\n\nThe legislation the group is working on aims to secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, contingent on a secure border first, crack down on employers, and improve legal immigration. Senators have indicated some consensus on elements related to border security and the path to citizenship. However, they are struggling on the question of legal immigration and future workers, and are trading proposals with leaders of the AFL-CIO and Chamber of Commerce to try to reach a deal.\n\nThe group has set a self-imposed March deadline to release their legislation, although it now seems that this deadline may slip until they return from a two-week recess in early April. They would aim for a vote in the Judiciary Committee soon thereafter, followed by consideration by the full Senate and the House. Success is far from assured, and the process could fail at any point. Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has given the group the time and space to complete their work, but he has also signaled his patience is not infinite and may bring up more liberal immigration legislation if the Gang of Eight does not produce a bill.\n\nThe group came together after the November election, when Sen. Graham phoned Sen. Schumer. The resounding victory of President Obama among Latino voters underscored to Republicans like McCain and Graham the need for the GOP to act on immigration. Schumer, McCain, and Graham are all veterans of past failed attempts on the issue, most notably in 2007 when legislation backed by then-President George W. Bush failed on the Senate floor.\n\nThe senators have been working to round up support for their efforts. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) was approached by Schumer during Congress's lame-duck session. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) had been shopping his own immigration proposals that align with what the senators are working on. The Gang of Eight began working on drafting principles and released their blueprint at a packed news conference at the Capitol on Jan. 28. Since then, they have been quiet, focusing on finalizing their bill and expressing cautious optimism that this time they will finally succeed in solving a problem that has long bedeviled Washington. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said, \"Everybody there wants to get it done and nobody's looking for political points or political advantage. Everybody's looking to get it done, and that makes all the difference.\"",
    " Title: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Meets Taliban Officials in Qatar Amidst Ongoing Tensions in Afghanistan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to salvage the historic US-Taliban deal signed in February, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to meet Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar, on Monday. The high-level talks will be the first between the United States and the Taliban, according to the US State Department.\n\nSecretary Pompeo will engage in discussions with Mullah Baradar, the Taliban's chief negotiator, to press the Taliban to adhere to the agreement signed last month. The meeting is scheduled to take place at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base, a location that served as the host for a year of talks between the United States and the Taliban.\n\nThe US-Taliban agreement, signed in Qatar on February 29, includes a provision for organizing talks between the Afghan leadership and the Taliban to establish lasting peace in Afghanistan. However, these formal talks have yet to commence due to disagreements over the release of prisoners, a condition set by the Taliban, and the ongoing feud between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nThe standoff between Ghani and Abdullah has stalled the selection of a negotiating team to represent the Afghan government in the planned talks with the Taliban. Diplomatic sources in Kabul and two other Afghan officials reported that the meetings between Pompeo and the Afghan leaders were inconclusive.\n\nThe US-Taliban agreement also calls for the gradual withdrawal of US and other foreign troops over a 14-month period, with the main focus of US diplomatic efforts being the withdrawal. The first phase of this withdrawal has already begun, although some troop movements have been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn exchange for the withdrawal, the Taliban has agreed not to allow Afghan soil to be used against American security interests and has promised to negotiate for the first time with the West-backed Kabul leadership. However, since the Doha agreement was signed, the Taliban have continued to carry out attacks.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has added urgency to the release of prisoners, a condition set by the Taliban, as per a plea made by US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad last week. The pandemic has infected over 360,000 and killed more than 15,000 globally, and fears are growing that the thousands of Afghans returning home from neighboring Iran every day might contribute to the outbreak in a nation with a public health network devastated by years of war.\n\nOn Sunday, the Taliban and the Afghan government held a \"virtual\" meeting on prisoner releases. The ongoing tensions and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic underscore the challenges facing the US and the international community in their efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan.",

I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting.\" He further added, \"The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything.\"\n\nThe former president also took aim at Dowd, referring to her as \"crazy,\" \"wacky,\" and a \"neurotic dope.\" Trump tweeted, \"Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!\"\n\nThe attack came after Dowd's interview on CNN earlier Saturday, where she was promoting her new book, \"The Year of Voting Dangerously.\" During the interview, Dowd stated, \"I told him that it was wrong that there was violence being incited at his rallies and that reporters were getting roughed up. He paused - you're right, he did listen - but then he disagreed and said he thought the violence added a frisson of excitement.\"\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Dowd highlights the ongoing tension between the former president and the media, particularly The New York Times, during his presidency and beyond.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Suggests Possibility of Rematch Against Trump in 2020, Sparks Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with PBS Newshour, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hinted at a potential rematch against President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump despite winning the popular vote, joked that she could beat him again if she were to enter the race.\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton referenced her popular vote win in 2016 and responded to President Trump's suggestion that she should run to \"steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\" Trump had also criticized Clinton for deleting 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena.\n\nClinton responded, \"Do your job,\" and added, \"Don't tempt me. Do your job.\" In a tweet following the interview, Clinton said, \"Do your job. Don't tempt me. Do your job.\"\n\nWhen asked about the exchange during her interview with Woodruff, Clinton described Trump's tweet as \"typical\" and questioned what motivates the President other than personal grievance and seeking adulation. Clinton had previously stated during the 2016 campaign that there was no other Donald Trump, and that what Americans saw was what they were going to get.\n\nClinton's comments have sparked speculation about a potential 2020 run, as she has previously stated that she has no plans to run for office again. Her latest tweet, which included a video of her dancing to the song \"Don't Tempt Me,\" has only fueled the rumors.\n\nIn response to Clinton's comments, Twitter users have been quick to comment, with one user tweeting, \"Hillary Clinton claimed she could beat Donald Trump 'again' in 2020. But, seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anyone understands, what motivates him other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\"\n\nAs of now, Clinton has not officially announced any plans to run in the 2020 presidential election. The primary season is still several months away, and the field of Democratic candidates is currently crowded. It remains to be seen whether Clinton will enter the race or if her comments were simply a joke.",

Ron Johnson (R-WI) emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to border security and criticized \"sanctuary city\" jurisdictions, including California.\n\nStanding on the U.S. side of the border, Secretary Kelly reaffirmed the administration's commitment to a \"physical barrier\" along the southern border and the importance of stopping human trafficking. He cited drastic reductions in the number of illegal border crossings, which he attributed to the Trump administration's tough stance on border security and immigration laws.\n\nAttorney General Sessions praised the progress made under the Trump administration and warned about the danger of infiltration by gangs like MS-13. He also launched a broadside against sanctuary cities, citing the case of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015 by an illegal immigrant with seven prior felony convictions who had been deported five times.\n\nSessions warned that the Department of Justice had sent letters to nine jurisdictions, including California, that potentially violate federal law and receive millions in federal grants. The California State Senate recently passed a \"sanctuary state\" bill, SB 54, which awaits passage by the State Assembly before proceeding to Governor Jerry Brown's desk.\n\nJohnson, who serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, reiterated the Trump administration's support for border patrol and law enforcement. He defended the administration's enforcement of immigration law, rejecting the argument by sanctuary cities that it would hurt local policing.\n\nOutside the event, about a dozen demonstrators from the Remembrance Project, which commemorates victims killed by illegal aliens, gathered to support the Trump administration's efforts.

The 7.1-magnitude earthquake, which occurred 11 miles northeast of Ridgecrest, released 11 times the amount of energy of Thursday's quake, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\nThe quake caused widespread damage in the area, swaying buildings, cracking streets, and foundations. Residents reported gas leaks, water main breaks, and power and communication outages in some areas. Several injuries were reported, but no fatalities have been confirmed as of yet.\n\nJason Corona, co-owner of a Mexican restaurant in Ridgecrest, described the earthquake as \"different from the other ones that we've had before.\" He recounted how bottles fell behind the bar, patrons dropped to the floor under tables, and spilled food made a slippery getaway for frightened guests who sprinted outside.\n\nRidgecrest resident Jaye Krona compared the earthquake to her \"rocking chair gone crazy.\" She and her friend Kelly-Jo Lewis spent the night outside on Lewis' driveway, citing the unstable conditions as unsafe for being indoors.\n\nSince Friday's quake, the region has experienced an average of one aftershock per minute, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Over 4,700 quakes have occurred since Thursday, with more than 3,000 above a magnitude 1, according to CalTech seismologist Lucy Jones.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Kern County on Thursday and in San Bernardino late Friday. President Donald Trump approved the request for a presidential emergency declaration for assistance on Saturday.\n\nIn neighboring Trona, a town of 2,000 people, power and water outages have been reported. Both earthquakes disrupted the main water system, and officials are bringing in water to residents and fire teams. There were two reports of burglary in Ridgecrest, according to police chief Jed McLaughlin.\n\nThe NBA Summer League game between the New Orleans Pelicans and the New York Knicks in Las Vegas was postponed on Friday following reports of the quake. The shaking was felt as far away as Mexico and Las Vegas, according to the USGS.\n\nCalTech seismologist Egill Hauksson pointed out that Ridgecrest was once known as the earthquake capital of the world due to the high number of small earthquakes that occur there. Seismologist Lucy Jones described the recent earthquakes as part of an ongoing sequence of a \"very energetic system.\"\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the USGS reported that the chance of another magnitude 7 or higher earthquake is 3%, while the chance of a magnitude 3 or higher earthquake hitting the area is more than 99%.",

Pompeo emphasized that the U.S. is committed to ensuring the voice of the Venezuelan people is heard, democracy prevails, and a brighter future is secured for the people of Venezuela.\n\nThe tension arose after troops loyal to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro obstructed a U.S.-backed aid delivery along the country's border with Colombia. This led to violent clashes between the troops and protesters aligned with opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, resulting in several deaths and hundreds of injuries due to tear gas.\n\nThe Trump administration, along with several European nations, has supported Guaid\u00f3 since he declared himself interim president last month. In an effort to appeal to Venezuelan-American voters in Florida, who have fled their home country due to economic instability, President Trump held a rally in Miami last week to denounce Maduro and socialism.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates have also called on Maduro to cease violence against his own citizens, going as far as labeling him a dictator.\n\nPompeo reiterated that the U.S. will continue to offer humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people and hold Maduro accountable. In a separate interview on CNN's State of the Union, Pompeo stated, \"There's more sanctions to be had. More humanitarian assistance that we can provide.\" He further added, \"The Venezuelan people will ultimately, I believe, hold accountable those who have done so much harm to the fundamental, basic rights of the people of Venezuela.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Increases Special Operations Forces in Syria as Part of Incremental Strategy Against Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's announcement on Monday that 250 Special Operations Forces will be deployed to Syria marks a potential shift in the U.S.'s approach to combating the Islamic State, with some experts suggesting that a \"start small\" strategy may be showing signs of promise.\n\nLast fall, Mr. Obama sent 50 special operators to Syria as trainers to gauge the effectiveness of the U.S.'s training efforts with Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunnis on the ground. Melissa Dalton, a former intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency, explains that the goal was to determine if the U.S. could use training to gain traction with local forces.\n\nOn Monday, Obama offered his assessment, stating that the expertise of the Special Operations Forces already in Syria \"has been critical as local forces have driven [the Islamic State] out of key areas.\"\n\nThe decision to increase the number of U.S. troops in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces appears to be an attempt to accelerate the process. According to Ms. Dalton, \"it seems to reflect that this proof of concept works. There's been some positive momentum built up, with the idea now being, 'OK, if we expand that out a bit further \u2013 multiply the amount of trainers in the country \u2013 then perhaps we can multiply the effects.'\"\n\nHowever, questions remain. As a diplomatic cease-fire falters, the U.S. seems to be focusing more on a military strategy, despite failing to define a clear end state. Ms. Dalton questions, \"Where are we building to? Is this the first of many incremental increases \u2013 and to what end?\"\n\nDespite these concerns, some experts argue that building out the program incrementally makes sense. Nicholas Heras, a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American Security, states, \"incrementalism is the right approach.\"\n\nThe increased deployment of U.S. troops to Syria mirrors another decision made last week, with more troops on their way to Iraq in expanded roles. Defense Secretary Ash Carter described these roles as bringing U.S. troops \"closer to the action.\"\n\nWith Obama expressing a desire to keep the U.S. out of another war in the Middle East, the increase in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces is seen as a relatively low-risk move. In the past, the U.S. has made more grandiose efforts at fighting the Islamic State, including a $500 million program to train Syrian anti-ISIS forces, which resulted in \"four or five\" fighters on the battlefield, according to Gen. Lloyd Austin.\n\nHowever, the Syrian rebels in the program were reportedly receiving \"terrific training,\" according to Christine Wormuth, the Pentagon's policy chief. The answer was to pivot to the 50 special operators, who have worked on refining their message to potential recruits.\n\nThe trainers have also had some success in expanding the number of Syrian Arabs within the Syrian Democratic Forces, according to Mr. Heras. This is important in building trust among anti-ISIS forces, as Kurds have been the U.S. forces' most reliable partners, but Syrian Arabs distrust them.\n\nA greater ethnic mix of forces battling ISIS could help in the long run. If these troops can ultimately take back control of their hometowns, they must find a way to live together and govern \u2013 a more challenging proposition than winning on the battlefield.\n\nIn the first train-and-equip mission, the emphasis was on fighters that had been recommended by Syrians on the ground, often with the Turks acting as intermediaries. Now, the latest pool includes \"guys who were expelled from ISIS-controlled territory, so they have a sense of vengeance \u2013 they're on a mission,\" according to Mr. Heras. \"For them, it's ISIS that's the major impediment to them being able to go back home, to build up their own government,\" he adds. \"For them, it's ISIS that's the main enemy.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Senator Jeff Flake Compares Trump's Media Criticism to Stalin's Propaganda Tactics\n\nIn an interview on ABC News' 'This Week,' outgoing U.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) drew a comparison between President Donald J. Trump's criticism of the media and the propaganda tactics used by totalitarian dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nDuring a discussion about a series of speeches Flake will be delivering over the next few weeks, host George Stephanopoulos read an excerpt from one of the speeches.\n\nStephanopoulos: \"We've gotten some excerpts of what you're planning to say, taking on the president's comments about calling the press the enemy of the people. And I just want to read a portion of what we've had. It's a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase 'enemy of the people' that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use. And of course, the president has it precisely backward. Despotism is the enemy of the people, the free press is the despot's enemy.\"\n\nFlake: \"Well, what I'm trying to say is, you know, you can talk about crowd size and this is pretty innocuous if there's a falsehood. But when you reflexively refer to the press as the enemy of the people or fake news, that has real damage. It has real damage to our standing in the world. And I noted how -- how bad it is for a president to -- to take what was popularized by Joseph Stalin, the enemy of the people, to refer to the press. And then now, today, you have authoritarians across the world using the term 'fake news' to justify cracking down on their opposition or -- or stanch legitimate debate. That's nothing we should be proud of.\"\n\nFlake's criticism of President Trump is well-documented, as reported by Cortney. The hostility between the two began when Flake's book, \"Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,\" was leaked, in which he criticized Trump's agenda. Trump mocked the senator at a rally in Phoenix following the discovery.\n\nIn a previous appearance on 'This Week,' Flake has also attacked Trump supporters as angry and resentful.",
    " Title: The Spread of Misinformation in Family Group Chats: A Growing Concern in Times of Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn times of crisis, the need for information and the desire to comfort loved ones often lead to the sharing of information within family group chats. According to sociologist Emma Spiro, this process can help alleviate people's anxieties by creating a communal understanding of the current situation. However, these conversations often involve sharing information that appeals to the individual rather than facts, as people are more likely to believe misinformation when it comes from those with whom they share close ties.\n\nCailin O' Connor, an associate professor of philosophy at UC Irvine, explained that people assess information based not only on its quality but also on their perceived social and cultural similarity to the person relaying it. \"The closer you perceive yourself to [be to] someone... the more you trust the information they're sharing,\" O' Connor said. \"With families, I would think, a lot of the time, that kind of closeness would be in place.\"\n\nA 2019 study in Science Advances found that people from older generations tend to share misinformation nearly seven times more frequently than younger family members, even when factors such as education and partisan affiliation were taken into account. This trend is concerning, as family group chats may include people less familiar with social media and less adept at filtering out misinformation.\n\nAdditionally, people may recognize that their relatives are spreading misinformation but find it difficult to correct them due to their close bonds. A 2019 study found that only 21 percent of people surveyed in the U.K. reported correcting others who shared false or inaccurate information. O' Connor suggested that this number is likely to be even smaller in family group chats, as it can be uncomfortable to disagree with those close to us.\n\n\"There is this psychological force of us all kind of wanting to conform a little bit and not stick out,\" O' Connor said. \"Within families, it can be a powerful force. When someone is saying, 'Oh, I believe X,' it pushes others just to accept it rather than to say, 'Well, you're wrong about X.'\"\n\nIn light of these findings, it is crucial to remain vigilant and fact-check information shared within family group chats, especially during times of crisis. It is also important to remember that while it may be uncomfortable to correct loved ones, doing so can help prevent the spread of misinformation and contribute to a more informed and accurate understanding of the current situation.",
    " Title: Atlanta Police Officers Charged in Shooting Death of Rayshard Brooks\n\nIn a press conference Wednesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced that former Atlanta Police Department Officer Garrett Rolfe and former Officer Devin Brosnan will face criminal charges in connection with the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks.\n\nRolfe, who fired the fatal shots, is charged with felony murder, while Brosnan, who was also involved in the altercation, is charged with aggravated assault. The charges stem from the June 12 incident at a Wendy's restaurant, where Brooks, 27, was asleep in the drive-thru.\n\nAccording to Howard, the officers' behavior after the shooting, which included Rolfe kicking Brooks' body, did not reflect any fear or danger from Brooks. Instead, their actions \"did not reflect any fear or danger of Mr. Brooks,\" Howard said, \"but their actions really reflected other kinds of emotions.\"\n\nHoward described Brooks as \"calm\" and \"cordial\" during the initial conversation with officers before the shooting. Brooks displayed a \"cooperative nature\" and \"almost jovial\" demeanor, despite being \"slightly impaired.\"\n\nThe officers first engaged Brooks because he was asleep in the drive-thru of the Wendy's restaurant. They woke him up, told him to park the car in the Wendy's lot, and administered a breathalyzer test and a field sobriety test, finding him to be over the legal limit. Brooks cooperated up to this point but attempted to escape when the officers were putting him in handcuffs.\n\nA physical altercation ensued, with both officers attempting to wrestle Brooks to the ground. Brosnan pulled out his Taser, which Brooks was able to take from his hand during the fight. Brooks escaped both officers and took off running with the Taser. Rolfe pulled out his own stun gun and attempted to stun Brooks, but was apparently unsuccessful.\n\nSurveillance footage shows Brooks apparently pointing the Taser at the officers pursuing him. Three shots were fired, and Brooks was shot twice in the back.\n\nRolfe was fired from the department, and Brosnan was placed on administrative leave. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned from her position after 25 years of service with the department. The Wendy's restaurant, where the shooting occurred, was set on fire in subsequent protests.

    " Title: Yovanovitch Testifies: Shock and Devastation Over Trump-Zelensky Call\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, testified on Friday that she felt threatened during a call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which her service in Ukraine was brought up.\n\n\"I was shocked and devastated,\" Yovanovitch told the House Intelligence Committee. \"It was a terrible moment.\"\n\nNicholas Wallace, a political analyst, commented on the testimony, stating, \"If you are not moved by the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch today, you do not have a pulse.\" He further added, \"This wasn\u2019t just testimony about the past, this played out in real time with the president attacking her.\"\n\nYovanovitch's testimony, which was not only about the past but also unfolded in real-time as Trump attacked her during the call, raised the possibility of witness intimidation as a new charge. When asked if she felt this was an effort to intimidate her and other witnesses, Yovanovitch responded, \"I feel that is quite intimidating.\"\n\nTrump, in a tweet to his over 65 million followers during Yovanovitch's public testimony, asserted that Yovanovitch had performed poorly during her career as a U.S. ambassador. He wrote, \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\"\n\nThe impeachment proceedings will continue into Friday afternoon, with major news networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, C-SPAN, and PBS all pre-empting regular programming to cover the historic event.",
    " Title: Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan Holds Firm on Military Construction Funds for Border Wall\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and resistance, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan has stated that he will make the final decision on $3.6 billion in military construction funds that President Trump wants to divert for the construction of a border wall. Shanahan, who took over the position in January, has emphasized that he has the discretion to decide on the matter and is not obligated to follow the White House's request.\n\nThe Pentagon chief, who is currently reviewing all projects that could potentially be affected, has expressed concerns about the politically charged battle that pits border security against military spending, two key priorities of the Republican Party. Projects at risk include upgrades to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, dock repairs at Pearl Harbor, and maintenance at other bases across the country and across all branches of the armed forces.\n\nWhite House officials aim to pull approximately $3.6 billion from the military construction funds, with the remaining $8 billion for the border barriers coming from other sources. However, Defense Department officials and lawmakers from both parties are resisting the idea of siphoning military construction funds. Shanahan has not yet committed to the $3.6 billion figure, stating that he needs to review all projects before making a decision.\n\nOne area Shanahan has ruled out is housing for troops. In response to questions about the potential impact on housing, Shanahan assured reporters that the military would continue to prioritize the care of its personnel.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) defended the president's strategy, stating that the border wall would ultimately benefit the students at Fort Campbell's school. However, other Republicans have expressed concerns about the potential impact on military readiness and training.\n\nWith the exception of Sen. Graham, most Republicans seem reluctant to defend pulling money from specific military projects, even as they support the broader goal of a border wall. The controversy has opened up a potential political divide between the president and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with Democrats zeroing in on specific military projects that could now be shelved.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Internal Struggle Over Anti-Semitism Allegations Against Rep. Ilhan Omar\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is grappling with a contentious issue of alleged anti-Semitism, as freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments continue to stir controversy. The latest controversy revolves around Omar's remarks about political influence and allegiance to foreign countries, which have been interpreted as a centuries-old slur against Israel supporters.\n\nOmar's comment has led to accusations of anti-Semitism from within her own party. Former Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT) stated, \"Words matter, and when people say words that are biased, bigoted, and hurtful, to another group of Americans, they have to be condemned quickly.\"\n\nThe Democratic leadership is currently debating a House resolution aimed at addressing the issue of anti-Semitism on Capitol Hill. The resolution, which was initially scheduled to be brought to the floor on Wednesday, has been delayed. The text of the resolution has not been released to the public.\n\nKayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump-Pence reelection campaign, criticized Omar's remarks, stating, \"This is not a one-time thing for Ilhan Omar. There have been multiple remarks. Likewise, we have seen some comments that are similar from Rashida Tlaib and certainly those around her.\" McEnany also suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) should remove Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nThe delay in the resolution's passage and the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party over Omar's comments has caused a rift among party members. Some Democrats, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, question the need for continuous resolutions addressing the issue, given that the House has already voted on a similar measure.\n\nOmar, one of two Muslim women in Congress, has declined to apologize for her latest statement. The controversy comes just a few weeks after another set of Omar's tweets were condemned by House leadership, including Speaker Pelosi, for containing anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nRepublican leaders, including Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have also weighed in on the controversy. Scalise stated, \"If they really are serious about addressing the problem, Nancy Pelosi has to remove her from the Foreign Affairs Committee.\" McConnell added, \"It's unconscionable for any member of the United States Congress, any less a member of the foreign relations committee, to repeatedly traffic in base stereotypes.\"\n\nThe ongoing controversy and the delay in the resolution's passage highlight the internal divisions within the Democratic Party over support for Israel and the definition and handling of anti-Semitism.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Shift in Political Stance: A Surprising Turn in the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has emerged as a vocal advocate for addressing income inequality, a shift that has left some Democrats and political observers in a state of disbelief. This newfound focus on poverty and wage gap has been met with skepticism and criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with many questioning the authenticity of Romney's sudden change in stance.\n\nOn Friday, Romney addressed the Republican National Committee aboard the USS Midway in San Diego, arguing that President Obama's policies have failed to close the wage gap and have led to an increase in poverty. \"Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before,\" Romney stated.\n\nHowever, this new approach has been met with criticism from Democrats, who argue that Romney's commitment to addressing income inequality is insincere and a tactical move rather than a genuine commitment. Stephanie Cutter, Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager, stated, \"A message only works if it's authentic to the messenger. I'm not sure voters will trust that that's the case here.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made income inequality the centerpiece of his 2013 mayoral campaign, was particularly critical of Romney's sudden conversion. \"Doing it in such a ham-handed manner in what appears to be a deathbed conversion is a strange way to suddenly come out of the box with it, and I find it disingenuous, and I think a lot of other people will too,\" de Blasio said.\n\nAs Romney considers another presidential run, he will need to convince both his party and the American people that he is genuinely committed to addressing income inequality. This shift in stance could potentially make income inequality a defining issue of the 2016 campaign, with other candidates likely to follow suit in addressing the issue.\n\nThe question remains whether Romney's new stance on income inequality will be enough to win over voters and secure him the Republican nomination. With a crowded field of more dynamic newcomers, Romney will need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to his new cause and prove that he is capable of connecting with average Americans. Only time will tell if Romney's shift in stance will be successful or if it will be seen as a tactical move rather than a genuine commitment to addressing income inequality.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry Criticizes President Obama's One-Size-Fits-All Approach, Addresses Death Penalty and Minimum Wage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on \"Meet the Press,\" Texas Governor Rick Perry criticized President Barack Obama's approach to implementing one-size-fits-all solutions to various national issues, including the death penalty and joblessness. Perry, a Republican, expressed his disapproval of the administration's application of a uniform solution to a wide range of problems, from capital punishment to employment.\n\nGovernor Perry commented on the botched execution in Oklahoma last week, stating that it warranted a pause in the process within the state, but not necessarily on a national level. President Obama, on Friday, directed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the application of the death penalty across the country, including the disproportionate sentencing of minorities.\n\nTexas, the second largest state in the nation, has the highest number of executions, with 273 individuals currently on Death Row. Perry emphasized that Texas, which uses a single drug for lethal injection, differs from Oklahoma, which employs a combination of drugs in the execution process. The botched Oklahoma case involving Clayton Lockett, 38, who returned to consciousness and died of a heart attack, was cited as an example of something going terribly wrong.\n\nTurning to the economy, Perry stated that Texas is not focusing on raising the minimum wage, but rather on the \"maximum wage.\" The governor has been actively recruiting employers from other states to Texas. He noted that 95% of the jobs created in Texas are above minimum wage, and the minimum wage discussion is irrelevant when there are no jobs available.\n\nPerry, who has been traveling the country, spoke of an oft-repeated Republican theme that minimum-wage jobs are entry-level positions, not intended to support a family. On his own plans to run for president again in 2016, Perry agreed with critics who labeled his 2012 effort a failure. However, he argued that a person's character is more evident when they demonstrate their ability to perform well after experiencing failure.",
    " Title: Democrats Face Internal Divide: Center-Left or Populist Approach Post-Obama Era\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama prepares for his second inauguration on Monday, the Democratic Party, which has largely united under Obama's leadership, is set to confront a central question about its political identity. The question revolves around whether the party will adopt a center-left, Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)-inspired approach or return to a more populist, left-leaning stance that mirrors its electoral coalition.\n\nThe entitlement debate, particularly regarding Social Security and Medicare, could serve as an immediate test for Obama and congressional Democrats, as they consider any potential benefit cuts to achieve deficit reduction. \"In the short term, that's the flashpoint,\" said longtime Democratic consultant Paul Begala.\n\nAs moderate Republicans become increasingly scarce, and more centrists find a home in the Democratic coalition, the party must also reconcile its stance on a broader range of economic issues, including Wall Street regulation and public employees. As the 2016 presidential race approaches, and potential candidates begin to maneuver, Democrats will need to decide whether they want to be identified as the party of Rahm Emanuel or Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"One of the challenges is how we continue to do the right thing while working with a wide coalition of people, both workers and business,\" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFor decades, cultural issues divided Democrats internally, as they grappled with GOP charges of extremism on issues ranging from race to gender to gay rights. However, due to Bill Clinton's influence and broader cultural shifts in the country, there is now a consensus among Democrats on social issues such as abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and immigration reform.\n\nThe rise of the Obama coalition, a diverse group of youth, minorities, and women, has reshaped the party. It is unlikely that any serious Democratic White House contender in 2016 would not align with the party on such issues. The Republicans, on the other hand, are now grappling with internal divisions on cultural matters as they strive to appeal to a rapidly changing nation.\n\n\"The center has moved,\" said veteran Democratic strategist Mandy Grunwald.\n\nThe divide within the Democratic Party centers on fiscal and class issues, between its populists and elites, on how to appeal to a broad group of voters while maintaining their commitment to those in need. In essence, finding a way forward that represents the interests of their affluent supporters in areas like McLean, Virginia, and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, while staying true to middle-class backers in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and addressing the needs of the poor in Albuquerque and Philadelphia.\n\n\"The real struggle within the Democratic Party is where you stand on income inequality and whether the government needs to be a part of fixing that problem,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"The demographics that the Democratic Party must attract are the people who need responsive government.\"",
    " Title: Harvard University's Admissions Policies Under Scrutiny in Trial Alleging Discrimination Against Asian-Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a trial that could reshape the role of race in U.S. college admissions, Harvard University is defending its admissions policies against allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants. The trial, taking place in a federal court in Boston, pits Harvard against Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), an organization founded by an activist opposed to affirmative action policies.\n\nThe SFFA's complaint against Harvard is supported by the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The trial, presided over by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, offers a unique insight into Harvard's admissions process, which selects approximately 1,600 students each year from about 40,000 applicants.\n\nJohn Hughes, a lawyer for SFFA, argued that admissions data from Harvard showed a clear bias against Asian-Americans, particularly in terms of \"personal ratings,\" a measure of abstract qualities such as leadership skills and friendliness. \"That Asian-Americans get worse personal ratings year after year is pretty strong evidence that racial bias has crept into the system,\" Hughes stated.\n\nHarvard's lawyers conceded that Asian-Americans, on average, received lower personal rating scores in recent years. However, they maintained that this was just one of many factors considered in the admissions process. Asian-Americans, on average, scored higher than other racial groups on some factors, they argued.\n\nThe plaintiffs focused narrowly on the personal score to find the \"Asian penalty\" they were seeking, according to Seth Waxman, one of Harvard's lawyers. SFFA's lawyers, on the other hand, argued that Harvard engaged in \"racial balancing,\" keeping Asian-American admissions at or under 20 percent annually in the years before SFFA sued in 2014.\n\nHarvard, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, denies the allegations and claims its approach to promoting student body diversity is in line with Supreme Court precedent. SFFA is led by Edward Blum, an activist involved in other cases challenging the use of race in college admissions. The U.S. Justice Department launched a related investigation of Harvard after President Trump took office last year, and has backed SFFA's case, stating that Harvard has not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions.\n\nLegal experts predict a ruling from the judge between December and March 2019. If the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, the newly-established five-member conservative majority could potentially bar the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants gain admission to college. In previous affirmative action rulings, which aim to counter historic patterns of racial discrimination, the Supreme Court has allowed colleges to include race as one factor among others in assessing applicants.",
    " Title: Trump Admits Decision to Fire Comey Unrelated to Justice Department Recommendation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Lester Holt, President Trump has admitted that his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey was not based on the Justice Department's recommendation.\n\n\"It was set up a while ago,\" Trump said, referring to the dismissal of Comey. \"And frankly, I could have waited, but what difference does it make?\" he added.\n\nTrump further stated, \"Regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.\"\n\nThe president's remarks undermine the prior rationale provided by the White House, which stated that Comey was fired due to his handling of the Clinton email investigation, based on a review by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.\n\nTrump criticized Comey, calling him a \"showboat\" and a \"grandstander.\" He cited the FBI's turmoil and the agency's state a year ago as reasons for his decision.\n\nThe president also blamed Democrats for the Russia storyline, stating, \"When I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\"\n\nHowever, Trump clarified that he never asked Comey to shut down the investigation and wants it to be seen through to the end, but by someone \"competent\" at the FBI.\n\nTrump's firing of Comey on Tuesday has raised questions about the timing, coming just as the FBI appeared to be ramping up its investigation of Trump associates' ties to Russia. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that the president had been thinking about firing Comey since November.\n\nAt Thursday's White House press briefing, Huckabee Sanders said the \"last straw that pushed\" Trump was Comey's testimony before Congress on May 3, in which he stated that he was \"mildly nauseous\" to think that he may have swung the election after coming forward days before the election to say that he was reopening the Clinton email investigation.\n\nRaising ethical questions, Trump admitted that he called Comey to find out whether he was under FBI investigation. This admission is remarkable given the delineation most presidents and FBI directors are careful to try to draw, to avoid the appearance of collusion or interference in what are supposed to be independent investigations, especially ones that might be related to themselves.\n\nTrump also said Comey told him two other times that he was not under investigation, once on the phone and once during a dinner that had been \"arranged.\" Trump initially claimed in the interview that Comey asked for the dinner to ask to stay on as FBI director, but Comey did not need to do that, as he was appointed to a 10-year term in 2013.\n\nTrump also told Holt that just because he fired Comey does not mean he does not want to get to the bottom of Russian meddling in the election. \"I want to find out if there was a problem in the election having to do with Russia,\" Trump said, adding, \"If Russia did anything, I want to know about it.\"\n\nHe insisted that his campaign and Russia did not collude, stating, \"I have nothing to do -- this was set up by the Democrats.\"\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the election, by hacking and leaking Democratic campaign emails, for example. The intelligence community has also concluded that Russia was trying with its efforts to get Trump elected.\n\nTrump said he wants the investigation \"over with,\" despite the intelligence community's conclusions, three times he qualified Russia's involvement with \"if.\"\n\n\"If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election I want to know about it,\" Trump said.\n\nHolt pointed out that the evidence already exists that Russia did meddle.\n\n\"I 'll tell you this,\" Trump said, repeating, \"if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen.\"\n\nHe said he thought the investigation \"should be over with, in my opinion, should have been over with a long time ago.\"\n\nThe White House claimed Wednesday that morale was low at the FBI and was also a reason behind Comey's dismissal. However, this was disputed by acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who said at a congressional hearing Thursday that Comey had the full confidence of the bureau.\n\nSince the election, Comey has publicly confirmed that there was an ongoing FBI investigation into Trump associates and collusion with Russia, and he disputed under oath the president's baseless claim that President Barack Obama ordered his team to be wiretapped. Comey was fired the next day.",
    " Title: Partial Government Shutdown Affects National Parks and Services, Volunteers Step In\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown, now entering its second weekend with no signs of a compromise, has led to a partial closure of about a quarter of the federal government, affecting various services and national parks.\n\nAt Joshua Tree National Park in California, visitors centers are closed, and the park's bathrooms are not being maintained by the Park Service. However, the local community has rallied together to clean the bathrooms and restock toilet paper.\n\nJohn Lauretig, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Joshua Tree National Park, expressed concern about the long-term effects of the shutdown. \"As the dumpsters fill up and the pit toilets fill up, what kinds of solutions can we make to solve those problems?\" he asked.\n\nPoliticians in Washington have offered little hope of a quick resolution to the spending standoff. President Trump has insisted on $5 billion for his proposed border wall, while Democrats have refused. The stalemate has left nine major government departments, including Homeland Security, Interior, and State, without spending authorization.\n\nSo far, the effects of the partial shutdown have been minimal, with 400,000 critical federal employees staying on the job, albeit without pay. However, the longer the shutdown continues, the more widespread the effects will be.\n\nJacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, warned that more services will be affected as funding runs out. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to halt operations, and the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will close their doors on January 2.\n\nThe food stamps program (SNAP) and the school lunch program are funded through January but could be affected if the shutdown continues beyond that. The Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages could also be delayed, and FEMA's decision to stop selling flood insurance during the shutdown has been reversed following pressure.\n\nEconomist Kevin Hassett predicted that the shutdown would not cause lasting damage to the U.S. economy, but admitted it could cause a temporary blip in the unemployment rate if hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain idle for a few weeks.\n\nDespite the challenges, volunteers at Joshua Tree National Park are keeping the park clean and maintaining the park's unique artifacts and history. However, Lauretig emphasized the need for a fully-staffed National Park Service to protect these one-of-a-kind artifacts. \"My concern is right now those one-of-a-kind kind of things in the park are unprotected, unfortunately,\" he said.",
    " Title: Republican Convention Discord: Grassroots Activists and Establishment Clash Amidst Hurricane Isaac\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hurricane Isaac looms over the Gulf Coast, the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, has been postponed, providing a rare opportunity for disgruntled delegates to voice their concerns. Drew McKissick, a South Carolina delegate, stated, \"Everybody who has a reason to be upset about something has time to talk about it.\"\n\nThe postponement has led to a series of closed-door meetings between Mitt Romney's aides and conservative activists, resulting in a compromise that aims to create a \"warm and fuzzy\" convention atmosphere, according to one person involved. The compromise reportedly prevents what activists called a power grab by the party establishment.\n\nRon Paul supporters, however, expressed frustration over what they perceive as efforts by the Romney campaign to silence their voices in the convention hall. Paul, who has declined a speaking slot, has accused the Romney campaign of trying to control his message.\n\nSupporters of Todd Akin, the Missouri Senate candidate who lost much of the party's support after his comments on \"legitimate\" rape and pregnancy, have revived Tea Party-infused arguments against the \"establishment\" wing of the party, accusing Romney and \"party bosses\" of abandoning Akin after his remarks.\n\nThe storm has also posed a delicate challenge for President Obama, whose efforts to manage the response may have given him a moment to look presidential in Romney's absence, but are also fraught with the risk of appearing to take advantage of a natural disaster at a highly politicized moment.\n\nConvention planners have no regrets about their decision to postpone Monday's activities, and they believe any discord will be forgotten by Tuesday night, when Ann Romney and Chris Christie are set to speak. Newt Gingrich, in an interview, dismissed the worry among some senior Republicans, stating, \"We\u2019re going to leave here united and with enormous energy, enthusiasm and eagerness to defeat Barack Obama.\"\n\nHowever, a growing group of grass-roots conservative activists has used the extra day to mobilize support for their right to quash the effort by Romney's legal team to give party presidential nominees more say over the selection of convention delegates sent by the states. This rule change would have potentially hindered insurgent candidacies like Rick Santorum's and helped Romney in a potential primary challenge four years from now, some opponents argue.\n\nThe upstart talk extends beyond the fight over the party's nominating procedures. At a Tea Party \"unity rally\" on Sunday night, Herman Cain told attendees, \"There were some people who hoped you all wouldn't show up,\" adding, \"Y'all fooled them!\" Cain, who endorsed Romney in May, had earlier said on CBS News that he would have been the party's nominee if \"everyone had competed fairly and honestly.\"\n\nEven when the Republican national chairman, Reince Priebus, gaveled the convention to order and unveiled two national debt clocks, a symbolic barb at government spending under Obama, a group of Ron Paul supporters were staging a demonstration in the hall with signs that altered the convention's \"We Can Do Better\" theme to \"Ron Paul Can Do Better.\"\n\n\"They want to make everyone think that we all are united behind Romney. That's not true,\" said Jeremy McReynolds, a 25-year-old activist helping to organize Paul's delegates at the convention. Saul Anuzis, a delegate from Michigan and a Romney supporter, urged those making \"mischief\" to settle down and fall in line behind Romney for the good of the party. \"What you would hate to see happen is they minimize the positives with all of their shenanigans,\" Anuzis said.",
    " Title: Democrats' Potential Investigative Agenda if They Win Control of U.S. Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate in the Nov. 6 elections, a wide range of investigations into President Donald Trump's presidency could be initiated, from his tax returns to potential business ties with Russia and conflicts of interest, according to congressional sources.\n\nWhile the sequencing and scope of these inquiries is still being determined, leaders are clear about what is not on the agenda: impeachment of Trump, at least until the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections and possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow.\n\nIf Democrats take control of the House or Senate, they would move quickly to obtain Trump's tax returns to examine potential business ties to Russia and conflicts of interest, as well as a possible examination of his handling of security clearances. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, unlike recent U.S. presidents.\n\nPolls show Republicans are likely to lose control of the House while possibly expanding their majority in the Senate. Few congressional aides and leaders will speak openly about the Democrats' investigative agenda.\n\nDemocratic majorities in the House or Senate would bring more resources for investigations that could potentially derail or delay Trump's agenda, but aides said Democrats will still aim for some bipartisan cooperation to avoid appearing overtly political ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an interview, warned that Democratic probes could be \"reminiscent of the late 1990s when we thought it was a good idea politically to impeach Bill Clinton and the public got mad at us, and felt sorry for him.\"\n\n\"It could end up not working well for them, at all,\" McConnell added.\n\nIf Democrats take the House, Representative Elijah Cummings, who is likely to be the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, would lead investigations. During Trump's presidency, Democrats on that committee have sought 64 subpoenas, which Republican committee members have denied. If Democrats win control of the House, those subpoenas would not be issued all at once, aides said, but they offer a roadmap of Democrats' intentions.\n\nCummings would take a \"two-lane\" approach, examining Trump's businesses and potential conflicts of interest, while also probing \"day-to-day\" issues such as prescription drug pricing, voter suppression, and questions about citizenship added to the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nAnother early item on the agenda would likely be Trump's revoking of security clearances from perceived political enemies and his granting of an interim security clearance to an aide who later resigned amid allegations of spousal abuse, aides said.\n\nCummings would also examine the use of private email at the White House by Trump's son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner, aides said. Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of private email as secretary of state was an issue in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nProbes into Trump would also be conducted by the House Judiciary Committee, the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. There is no plan for a special temporary committee, but Democratic leaders would coordinate investigative efforts with the heads of the committees, aides said.\n\nThe committees would spend January organizing, with investigations cranking up as soon as February, they added. The Ways and Means Committee would use its authority to request Trump's tax returns from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The judiciary and intelligence committees could then use the returns to dig into whether Trump received anything of value from foreigners or had business ties to Russia.\n\nSenate Democrats have a list of Trump-related concerns that runs about 100 pages, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nAdam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, wrote on Friday in the Washington Post that the Republican-controlled Congress had abdicated its oversight duty and \"been complicit in some of the president's most egregious attacks on our democratic institutions.\"\n\nSchiff said Democrats must \"restore Congress as an equal branch and check the ambition of an imperial and erratic president.\"",
    " Title: Fact-Checking America Web Media's Claims on Trump Campaign's \"Spy Gadgets\" and the Trump Blimp\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent resurgence of an earlier claim by America Web Media, the outlet suggested that President Donald Trump's re-election campaign might employ \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets\" to collect data on American citizens through a campaign blimp. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a different story.\n\nInitially reported in March by various outlets, including Politico, the Associated Press, and Fox News, the Trump campaign had indeed planned to send a blimp emblazoned with the Trump-Pence logo over swing states from May to July. The blimp was intended to serve a dual purpose: campaigning and collecting voter data.\n\nAccording to the March reports, the campaign was planning to gather voter information through a message on the blimp encouraging those who see it to text the Trump campaign. The campaign would then be able to use the respondents' contact information for donation requests and to send election materials. The America Web Media article's claim of \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets\" for data collection is inaccurate, as the data collection that was planned would have been entirely voluntary.\n\nSince the initial round of reporting, the situation has significantly changed. With the coronavirus pandemic causing the cancellation or postponement of many large gatherings, the Trump blimp, as reported, never made it beyond the planning stage. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment, and there have been no reports of sightings of the blimp and the campaign has said nothing about it publicly.\n\nIn summary, the America Web Media article's claim that the Trump blimp would use \"state-of-the-art spy gadgets to gather data on the American people\" is false. The data collection, as initially reported, would have been voluntary and through text messages. The information presented in the article, while accurate at the time of its first publication, is now outdated due to the changes brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.",
    " Title: Abortion Debate in Texas Threatens Democrats' \"Turn Texas Blue\" Strategy Amidst Opposition from Latino Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing abortion debate in Austin, Texas, is proving to be a challenging terrain for Democrats in their quest to \"turn Texas blue.\" The party's strategy to attract a new generation of Latino voters has been met with an unexpected hurdle as the abortion issue, a hot-button topic nationally, may not resonate with the very voters Democrats are targeting in the state.\n\nThe issue arose when Governor Rick Perry added an anti-abortion bill to the special session in June, reviving it in a second special session that started in July. This unexpected turn of events has placed Democrats in a precarious position, as the ensuing battle over the bill has drawn attention to an issue that may galvanize liberals nationally but is not particularly appealing to the Latino voters Democrats are hoping to win over in the state.\n\nIn candid conversations, Democrats admit that abortion is not the issue they would have chosen to lead the pitch for Latino votes. Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, humorously acknowledged, \"Is this the issue we would have picked to turn Texas blue? No, it was kind of thrust at us. We didn't pick it.\"\n\nPolls suggest that the Democrats' position on abortion may not be popular among Latino voters. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, 53% of Hispanic Catholics believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, a higher percentage than all other religious voting groups, including white Catholics, white mainline Protestants, black Protestants, and Jews.\n\nSteve Munisteri, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party, cited a poll by the Wilson Perkins Allen research firm that found a 2-1 \"pro-life\" margin among the state's Hispanic voters. The poll, conducted for the state GOP, showed that 62% of Texas Hispanics who voted in the 2012 election described themselves as pro-life, while just 32% called themselves pro-choice.\n\nSome Democratic strategists argue that the key to winning over Latinos is to avoid focusing too much on any one issue, especially abortion. Matt Angle, a longtime state strategist, suggests that the party's candidates should develop a broader pitch on a range of issues important to Latinos, but one powerful message, he says, is \"overreach\" by imposing such strict health and safety standards that many of the state's health clinics have to shut down.\n\nAs the Democrats face an uphill battle in Texas, with the party not winning a statewide race since 1994 and losing control of the Legislature years ago, the abortion debate may prove to be a significant obstacle in their efforts to attract and retain Latino voters. However, most Texas Democrats remain optimistic, believing that Latinos' anti-abortion views will not sink their hopes.\n\nJames Aldrete, an Austin-based consultant, points to polls that suggest Latinos' opposition to abortion may be softer than it appears. He cites a poll earlier this year by Lake Research Partners that found that 74% of Latinos believe women have the right to make their own decisions without interference from politicians, and a similar percentage said they wouldn't judge women who decide they're not ready to be parents.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Shifts Focus to Elizabeth Warren as Rising Candidate Threatens Blue-Collar Base\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift of strategy, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign is targeting Senator Elizabeth Warren, a move that reflects the volatility of the Democratic primary and the potential threat she poses to the president's blue-collar base.\n\nThe Trump campaign, which had initially focused almost exclusively on Joe Biden, is now training its firepower on Warren, aiming to blunt her momentum. This reassessment, confirmed in conversations with more than a half-dozen Trump advisers, comes as Warren's disciplined style, populist-infused speeches, and perceived ability to win over suburban female voters have raised concerns within the Trump team.\n\nCampaign pollster John McLaughlin has sounded the alarm internally, stressing that Warren's attacks on Trump threaten to undercut his support from the working-class voters who propelled him to the presidency.\n\n\"Although our own early published polls and internal polls discounted Elizabeth Warren, her recent momentum in May and June in national and early caucus and primary states into a strong second place to a flat Joe Biden is a cause for our campaign's attention,\" McLaughlin wrote in a text message to a colleague.\n\n\"Sen. Warren's attacks on President Trump's policies need to be rebutted,\" McLaughlin added. \"We can't just allow her to continue to attack the President in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and elsewhere.\"\n\nBiden will still receive a significant share of the campaign's attention. However, Trump aides say they're less certain that he'll be their eventual opponent.\n\nThe reelection campaign first began taking note of Warren's momentum several weeks ago, when polling showed her gaining substantially on Biden and Sanders. They were startled earlier this month when Tucker Carlson, a host on Trump-friendly Fox News, used the opening monologue of his show to heap praise on the liberal senator.\n\nWarren's populist economic agenda, Carlson said, \"sounds like Donald Trump at his best.\"\n\nOther pro-Trump Republican groups are paying closer attention to Warren, too. The GOP oppo research shop America Rising has placed Warren in its top tier of Democratic candidates and will prioritize putting trackers on her campaign events. The RNC, meanwhile, recently sent out a news release drawing attention to a radio interview in which Warren was pressed on her past claims of Native American ancestry.\n\nHowever, Trump aides are planning a barrage that extends well beyond the heritage issue, which has been the focus of Trump's mockery and broadsides. They're preparing to dig into her past as a professor and try to pick apart her laundry list of policy proposals.\n\n\"There's no question that Elizabeth Warren is on the move, has momentum, and could well end up as our opponent,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman. \"We have to make sure voters know about her proposals for government takeover of health care, free health care for illegal immigrants, radical environmental restrictions, and increased taxes\u2014all proposals that will devastate this country.\"\n\nA Warren spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWarren is enjoying a renaissance after a painful campaign rollout. Trump attacked her mercilessly after she released a DNA test that attempted to put the controversy over her bloodlines to rest only to reveal she's between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.\n\nDuring an appearance at his Mar-a-Lago resort in March, the president lamented to donors that he knocked Warren out of the race too early and that he should have saved his jabs for later. During a late April rally in Wisconsin, the president said Warren was \"finished.\"\n\nIn the weeks that followed, though, the anti-Wall Street crusader engineered a turnaround with a litany of policy plans, a nonstop campaign schedule, and a hard-charging populist message.\n\nIn the most recent national poll, from Quinnipiac University, Warren was at 15 percent, only slightly behind Sanders for second place. And in polls released this week of California and Nevada\u2014two key states that vote in late February and early March, respectively\u2014Warren leapfrogged Sanders, running behind only Biden.\n\nThe latest view inside the Trump campaign is that Warren has a more coherent message and a more passionate liberal following than Biden, whose support they see as soft. \"Her politics are where the Democratic party has moved,\" said Trump campaign adviser Raj Shah. \"She's primed to pick up more support as Bernie fades and Biden erodes.\"\n\nBiden and his supporters, however, are confident the Democratic electorate is more centrist than prognosticators think.\n\nNot everyone agrees that going after Warren is the right move. Some Trump aides contend that her liberal positions would make her an easier general election opponent and that they should hold off on attacking her. Others, however, argue that guessing a particular candidate's level of electability is impossible and that the Democratic nominee\u2014no matter who it is\u2014needs to be defined well before next year's convention.\n\n\"Now I see that Pocahontas is doing better,\" the president said during a Friday morning appearance on Fox News, using his favorite nickname for the Massachusetts senator. \"I would love to run against her frankly.\"",
    " Title: Obamacare Premiums Rise for 2015, but Consumers Can Minimize Costs with Careful Plan Selection\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is experiencing an average increase in premiums for 2015, according to various experts. However, this does not necessarily mean that consumers will see a rise in their Obamacare premiums.\n\nAvelere Health, an advisory firm, reports that consumers in the most popular 2014 plan, the cheapest silver tier plan, will pay an average of 10% more for the same policy next year. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, a consulting group, found an average increase of 5.2% when examining premiums for all tier levels by state.\n\nInsurers had difficulty pricing their policies for 2014 due to the absence of the exchanges, according to Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avelere. With a better understanding of the popularity of their offerings and the health status of their newly enrolled, insurers can set more precise premiums for 2015.\n\nHowever, the increased number of insurers offering plans for 2015 means that consumers will have a wider selection in terms of premiums, deductibles, doctor networks, and coverage options. This underscores the importance of consumers browsing through all the Obamacare plans available, especially those currently enrolled, to avoid being automatically re-enrolled and potentially paying more for coverage.\n\nEven if a policy's premium does not increase, consumers may still experience sticker shock for 2015 due to changes in their subsidy. Subsidies are based on the price of a benchmark, which is the second-cheapest silver plan being offered in their area that year. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit health policy research firm, found that the benchmark plan will rise 2% on average.\n\nIf the benchmark plan in someone's area carries a lower premium for 2015, the subsidy levels are recalculated. Consumers who do not check out next year's offerings may find their subsidy for 2015 covers a smaller share of their premium, whatever plan they pick.\n\n\"Shopping around is an imperative this year,\" Mendelson said. \"In many cases, they'll be able to find a lower-cost option.\"",
    " Title: Facebook Overhauls Privacy Tools Amidst Data Scandal and Regulatory Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In response to mounting criticisms over its data practices and impending European regulations, Facebook is revamping its privacy tools. The changes will not alter the company's privacy policies or the types of data it collects on users, but aim to make navigation of its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings easier for its 2.2 billion users.\n\nThe updates, announced Wednesday, follow the revelation that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, obtained data on millions of Facebook users, including information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, without explicit consent. Facebook is also facing criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers, and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not disclosed what it used such data for or why it was necessary.\n\nOn Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, stated in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for some time, but the recent events highlight their importance.\n\nFacebook plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but provided no further details. The company has attempted over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet controls remain hard to find and use for many people.\n\nIn an effort to address these concerns, Facebook will consolidate privacy settings into a single, easily accessible location. The company will also provide clearer explanations about how its privacy controls work. Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, described the new settings as \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns.\n\nFacebook has been preparing for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was approved two years ago and takes effect May 25. The regulations aim to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, regardless of the company's location.\n\nTo comply with the GDPR, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments, and things they have searched for. This is where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it required some effort to execute. Cox stated that the changes allow people to browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.\n\nCox noted that while the changes align with the principles of GDPR, there is \"a bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\" Facebook also plans to propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy, but provided no further details.",
    " Title: Disney's Strategic Shift: The Launch of Disney+ and the Pursuit of a Multi-faceted Media Empire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signifies a significant shift in the media landscape, Disney, one of the most profitable media conglomerates globally, has launched its own digital-video service, Disney+, in November 2019. Despite the crowded marketplace for subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services, Disney's vast content library, including the top eight highest-grossing films of the year, gives it a competitive edge.\n\nDisney's decision to invest in building its own SVOD service, rather than licensing its content to competitors like Amazon, Netflix, HBO, or Apple, was a strategic move with long-term implications. The initial investment includes the acquisition of BAMTech Media, a leading digital-video streaming company, and the purchase of 21st Century Fox for $85bn. In the coming years, Disney will spend billions more on original content and films for its service.\n\nThe low price point of Disney+, at $7 per month or less with an annual plan, has raised eyebrows in the industry. However, Disney's strategy is twofold. First, the company is entering a market already dominated by services like Netflix, Amazon, and HBO. By offering a lower price, Disney aims to attract subscribers and retain those frustrated by the absence of \"Star Wars\" and Marvel films, as Disney reclaims the full rights to its catalogue over several years.\n\nSecond, Disney's long-term ambition is to leverage the service to gain valuable data and direct customer relationships. For decades, Disney has thrived on the interconnection and cross-monetization of its various divisions. With Disney+, the company aims to bridge this gap, learning more about its consumers' preferences and tailoring its content, marketing, and merchandise accordingly. This data-driven approach could potentially lead to increased revenue from high-value offerings such as Disney family cruise vacations and annual park passes.\n\nDisney's multi-product strategy has led some analysts to compare Disney+ with Amazon's Prime Video, rather than Netflix. The endgame in SVOD isn't just video, but entire ecosystems, as evidenced by Apple giving its original content away free with devices and AT&T expected to give HBO Max to tens of millions of its subscribers. In this competitive landscape, Disney+ represents a strategic move to fortify the entire Disney empire, deepening its connection with consumers and driving growth across its various divisions.",
    " Title: George Zimmerman Files Lawsuit Alleging Witness Fraud in Trayvon Martin Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, George Zimmerman, the man acquitted in the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, has filed a lawsuit in Florida, accusing civil rights attorney Ben Crump and others of witness fraud and obstruction of justice. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, alleges that Crump helped to swap out a reluctant witness, Brittany Diamond Eugene, for her half-sister, Rachel Jeantel, and prepared Jeantel to deliver a scripted testimony that led to Zimmerman's trial.\n\nThe lawsuit, announced in tandem with a documentary titled \"The Trayvon Hoax,\" claims that Jeantel posed as Trayvon's girlfriend during the encounter with Zimmerman, while it was Eugene who was dating Trayvon and on the phone with him during the incident. The suit alleges that Jeantel delivered bogus testimony on the stand at Zimmerman's trial, despite Jeantel being two years older, 5 inches taller, and about 120 pounds heavier than Eugene.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Trayvon's parents, prosecutors, and state authorities of going along with the alleged ruse, and \"are alleged to either have known about or should have known about the witness fraud, obstructed justice, or lied repeatedly under oath in order to cover up their knowledge of the witness fraud,\" a news release from Zimmerman's attorney, Larry Klayman, said.\n\nJeantel, a key prosecution witness, testified during the trial that Trayvon told her in the phone call that someone was following him. As Trayvon neared the home of his father's girlfriend, he tried to lose Zimmerman, she testified. Jeantel said she heard him talking to Zimmerman in the background.\n\nThe plan was made final in a 3-minute phone call between Crump and Eugene on March 31, 2012, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks compensatory and actual damages of more than $100,000,000 and leaves open the possibility of an additional claim for punitive damages. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and Jeantel did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nZimmerman was acquitted of all charges in July 2013. Since then, he has been arrested in several alleged domestic incidents but not charged. Trayvon's death spurred a movement and helped give rise to the rallying cry that resonated with many: #BlackLivesMatter. The image of Trayvon wearing a hoodie became iconic, with professional athletes wearing hoodies and protesters repeating the mantra: \"I am Trayvon Martin\" to express solidarity and outrage.",
    " Title: Encouraging Inter-Regional Student Exchange in U.S. Colleges: A Step Towards Overcoming Polarization and Fostering National Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an increasingly polarized nation, it is crucial for colleges to offer students opportunities to study in states and regions far from their comfort zones. This move would not only benefit the students themselves but also contribute to the overall health of our democracy.\n\nAs a college student, I have witnessed the consequences of our divided nation on a daily basis. My university, while socioeconomically diverse, is predominantly populated by students from the top 20% income bracket, with more than half hailing from the blue states of Massachusetts, New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut. I have yet to encounter a publicly pro-Trump student on campus.\n\nThe lack of exposure to diverse viewpoints and experiences makes it challenging for us to understand the complexities of our country and the sources of its problems. To truly overcome our divisions and foster a better understanding of each other, we need to find ways to get citizens to move out of their \"bubbles\" and interact regularly with a wider variety of their fellow citizens.\n\nThis is the motivation behind \"national service\" programs, such as President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps proposal, which have become a staple for politicians, including during the 2020 presidential race. For example, Democrat Pete Buttigieg proposes a \"New Call to Service\" plan that views national service as \"essential to fashioning a common character.\"\n\nWhile these programs hold promise, they would require a substantial budget and a new bureaucracy. However, there is an existing program that has proven enormously successful and could be repurposed for this purpose: study abroad.\n\nOver the past generation, the number of American college students studying abroad has increased dramatically. Currently, about 16% of those earning bachelor's degrees spend part of their time in college abroad. Studying abroad is seen as a way for students to expand their worldviews, learn about other cultures and lifestyles, and gain skills like language proficiency that are necessary to thrive in our globalized world.\n\nThese are, of course, important and worthwhile goals. But learning more about our own country is equally important, and encouraging study \"at home\" rather than just study \"abroad\" could help achieve that. Programs that allow students to spend time at different universities in the United States do exist, but they are quite small. Given increasing partisanship and geographic sorting, these programs ought to be scaled up significantly, in order to ensure that students learn about the different types of people and lifestyles that make America so great.\n\nImagine if colleges set up programs to encourage students to spend a semester at a campus very different from theirs. If students from Hillsdale College and Harvard University, or State University of New York at Albany and The University of Alabama, or Brigham Young University and Brandeis University, switched places and spent a semester learning and living together?\n\nWhen people have one-off encounters with someone different from them, they are not likely to deeply connect with and empathize with that person. But when they spend significant amounts of time with them, doing a wide variety of activities\u2014sports, social events, volunteering, campus jobs\u2014they are more likely to relate to and perhaps even befriend them.\n\nSuch \"study in the U.S.\" programs should be the foundation for other campus initiatives to encourage students to have difficult conversations and interactions in safe and civil settings. This would not only inject different ideas but also make colleges places where young people learn the skills needed to become informed and empathetic citizens in a diverse society.\n\nHelping Americans learn more about the world is important, but so is helping Americans learn more about each other. Too many colleges have come to reflect the sorting and polarization plaguing our country. But they could become the place where we start to overcome these trends. The next time a college or university decides to add a new destination for their study abroad programs, they might consider Mississippi or Massachusetts in addition to Madrid. They'll be doing their students, and our democracy, a favor.\n\nIsaac Rose-Berman is a rising sophomore at Brandeis University and an intern at The Flip Side, a free daily newsletter that seeks to bridge the divide between Democrats and Republicans.

    " Title: The 2012 Election: A Small yet Expensive and Controversial Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 election, now concluded, marked a significant chapter in American political history, characterized by its unprecedented expense, garishness, and debasement. The campaign, which began with the first Republican primary debate in 2011, was a complex interplay of operatives, reporters, and a vast audience, captivated and repelled in equal measure.\n\nCritics, from both the left and the right, lamented the election's descent into triviality. Maureen Dowd, a columnist, described it as a race that \"looked more to the gutter than the stars,\" while Fred Barnes, in his final election column, titled \"Good Riddance.\"\n\nGary Hart, a former Colorado Senator who ran for president in the 1980s, criticized the campaign for its \"dumbing down of the message to elementary rhetoric that does not contain big ideas or challenging ideas.\"\n\nThe paradox of the 2012 campaign lies in its seeming bloatedness and all-pervasiveness, contrasted with its miniaturization and ephemerality. The election was, objectively, the most expensive in history, yet it was also marked by petty squabbles and inconsequential remarks.\n\nAt the heart of these criticisms are the candidates themselves, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, who, according to many, drove the election into cul-de-sacs of trivia and evasion. However, both men were caught in a vortex of large forces that converged to make the election small.\n\nThe arguments were small, with numerous days dominated by uproars over careless remarks. The debate often played out on cable TV and Twitter, shaping the contest in an unprecedented manner.\n\nThe playing field was small, with the Electoral College's usual bias towards a handful of swing states intensified this time by the candidates' relentless focus on mobilizing narrow demographic slivers within those states.\n\nThe leading actors were small, either content with their diminished stature or powerless to change it. Obama, who once encouraged people to view him as an epic figure, presented himself as a mortal figure this time, acknowledging setbacks and disappointments. Romney, who ran mainly as the vessel for anti-Obamaism, watched helplessly as his career achievements turned into partial liabilities.\n\nThree long-term trends contributed to making this election historically small. One consistent refrain of Barack Obama, especially in the early days of his administration, was his disdain for modern political media and the 24-7 news cycle. In June 2009, Obama told NBC's Brian Williams that he did not watch cable television, comparing it to WWF wrestling.\n\nThis election, with its small arguments, small playing field, and small leading actors, was a product of these long-term trends that shrank the election's scope and impact.",
    " Title: Trump's Tweets and the Ongoing Russia Investigation: A Constitutional Dilemma\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's growing frustration with the ongoing Russia investigation has once again surfaced on Twitter, with the President questioning the legitimacy of the investigation and the motives behind it.\n\nIn a series of tweets on August 5, 2018, Trump stated that the 2016 meeting in Trump Tower was not primarily about the issue of international adoptions, as previously stated, but was instead about gathering opposition research from a Russian lawyer with Kremlin ties. He also questioned the legality of the meeting, stating, \"What law, statute, rule or regulation has been violated? Nobody has pointed to one.\"\n\nTrump's tweets come in response to the revelation that the meeting was indeed about opposition research, a common practice in politics. His tweets also follow a previous tweet on August 1, 2018, in which he called for the investigation to end, labeling it a \"rigged witch hunt\" and accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased.\n\nDemocrats have labeled Trump's statements as obstruction of justice, while Trump's lawyers have maintained that the President is willing to sit down for an interview with the special counsel, but have advised against it, leaving the question of whether to subpoena the President unanswered.\n\nIn an interview with ABC This Week, Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, argued that the theory of obstruction of justice by tweet is \"absurd.\" He stated, \"For someone to make an allegation of obstruction, those are Article II powers,\" referring to the executive powers granted to the President under Article II of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhile the President is calling for the investigation to end, some Republicans, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL, believe the investigation should continue to ensure the truth comes out. Meanwhile, some Democrats have expressed support for the possibility of impeachment if grounds are found.\n\nThe ongoing Russia investigation and the President's tweets continue to create a constitutional dilemma, with the President asserting his executive powers and the investigation delving into the question of whether the President has obstructed justice. The outcome of this investigation remains to be seen.",

He stated, \"I asked a close friend of mine to do it [leak the memo]... I asked a close friend of mine to do it because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\"\n\nThe memo, detailing Trump's request for Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, was published online by The New York Times on May 16, and in the newspaper the following day. The story attributed the information to \"two people who read the memo\" without naming them.\n\nWhen questioned by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Comey did not reveal the friend's name but confirmed that he is a professor at Columbia University. On Thursday, Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia, confirmed that he was the close friend who served as intermediary.\n\nThis revelation sheds new light on the events that unfolded following Comey's dismissal in May 2017, and adds another layer to the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference and potential obstruction of justice by the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Lower Court Injunctions on Travel Ban Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has announced that it will review the lower court injunctions blocking the enforcement of President Donald Trump's executive order barring travel from six Muslim-majority countries. In a per curiam opinion, the Court partially stayed the injunctions, allowing for the enforcement of the executive order with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\n\nThe Court's decision comes as it consolidates the cases from the U.S. Courts of Appeal for the Ninth and Fourth circuit, Trump v. Hawaii and Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project, respectively. Both cases found the executive order unenforceable as a likely violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment Establishment Clause.\n\nThe Court's opinion states that the lower court injunctions went too far, as they also barred enforcement of the executive order against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States. The Court will hear arguments on the case when it reconvenes in October, with Attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center expected to face off against a government team now led by acting Solicitor General Jeffery Wall.\n\nThe government had argued in new briefing that the injunctions had delayed the start date for the 90-day order, allowing the ban, which affects those coming from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, to remain valid despite having been issued in March. A dissent from the per curiam decision, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, would have gone further and stayed the injunctions in their entirety, allowing the travel ban to go fully into effect immediately.\n\nThe executive order is the second issued on the matter. The first, Executive Order 13,769, also included Iraq and was immediately the subject of challenges in the courts. The current order was tailored to address the concerns raised in these initial lawsuits but soon was itself enjoined in both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits. Finding a likelihood the plaintiffs would succeed on First Amendment grounds, these courts' decisions to enjoin the orders have heretofore prevented enforcement of the order.\n\nPrevailing arguments in the lower courts have controversially included those based on statements made by the president and his surrogates while on the campaign trail as to his motivation for issuing the ban. The Trump administration has been determined to defend this version of the travel ban, setting up Monday's opinion and the potential for a Supreme Court hearing on the merits in the fall.",
    " Title: GOP Budget Battle: Defense Spending and Medicare Reform Stick Points in Bipartisan Struggle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly polarized Republican Party, GOP leaders are facing an uphill battle to pass their budget proposals amid disputes over defense spending and the pace of entitlement cuts. The latest development came on Thursday when GOP leaders announced a deal with top Democrats to scrap an 18-year-old tool designed to cut Medicare spending, sparking fierce opposition from conservative groups.\n\nThe spending fights will make it challenging for House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to assemble a coalition capable of passing a budget. Democrats, who have criticized the twin GOP proposals as \"warmed-over stew,\" are unlikely to offer assistance.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, stated, \"I haven't seen any budget they've put forth in a long time that does anything more than take us back to the failed economic policies under President Bush that took us to the brink of a depression, took us into a deep recession, and now they want to go back to a budget that does exactly the same thing.\"\n\nBoth the House and Senate will debate their budgets on the floor next week, with lawmakers grappling over whether they can support them. Rep. Matt Salmon, Arizona Republican, commented, \"We've already had some pretty embarrassing situations, but I think not being able to pass a Republican budget on the floor would be the granddaddy of them all.\"\n\nThe primary sticking point is a fight over defense spending. With Republicans in control of both chambers, defense hawks have pledged to reverse years of cuts to the Pentagon to combat terrorism and maintain control of adversarial countries. However, this would necessitate either politically difficult spending cuts or tax increases, or else the GOP will have to break the spending caps it imposed in a 2011 debt deal with President Obama.\n\nThe House Committee on the Budget approved its blueprint on a 22-13 party-line vote Thursday after a shaky 24 hours that underscored the defense rift. Budget Chairman Tom Price's budget cuts $5.5 trillion from spending over 10 years, overhauls Medicare into a voucher-like system, and makes steep cuts to welfare programs.\n\nThe Senate Republicans called the maneuver a gimmick, although they weren't thrilled with their own plan, which included $58 billion in war funds for fiscal 2016 and maintained sequester caps in later years. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, said the plan \"fails to prioritize our national defense after years of damaging cuts to our nation's military.\" Lawmakers amended it Thursday to recommend $96 billion in war money, matching the House's new aim.\n\nIn the House, Mr. Boehner said members will debate whether to boost war spending to $96 billion without requiring $20 billion in offsetting savings. \"There is overwhelming support in our conference for providing additional resources to protect our national security,\" he said at his weekly press conference. \"We have been and will continue to work with all of our members on this issue.\"\n\nCongressional budgets are blueprints without the force of law, but they offer a comprehensive outline of each party's agenda as lawmakers forge actual spending bills. This year's process provides the GOP a coveted path to putting an Obamacare repeal bill on President Obama's desk. However, the procedure, known as \"reconciliation,\" requires both chambers to agree on a compromise budget resolution and then pass laws carrying out the budget's instructions. Reconciliation is a powerful tool because it avoids a Democratic filibuster\u2014though President Obama would still wield a veto.\n\nCoupled with the budget fight is a battle over updating an unpopular Medicare formula that controls payments to doctors. Lawmakers face an end-of-month deadline to avert a 21 percent cut to doctors' Medicare payments, so that doctors do not flee the program. Passed as part of a budget deal in 1997, the \"sustainable growth rate\" was supposed to cap doctors' payments as a way of limiting the growth of Medicare. However, when it began to bite in the early 2000s, Congress balked at the cuts, and has approved repeated \"patches\" to boost payments to ensure doctors' full payments continue.\n\nMost lawmakers would like to do away with the annual problem, but they have been unable to agree on where to find the nearly $200 billion needed over the next decade to cover the costs of a permanent fix. On Thursday, congressional leaders said they have a framework for a replacement, which would give doctors a 0.5 percent pay raise each year for five years while streaming programs that evaluate their performance. \"I've been committed to finding a permanent solution to this problem,\" said Mr. Boehner. \"It's a chance to get rid of Washington's most infamous budget gimmicks.\"\n\nHowever, it will not be easy, as some conservatives have questioned why Mr. Boehner set out to work with Mrs. Pelosi before his own caucus. \"The door opened, and I decided to walk in it,\" the speaker said. \"Simple as that.\"",

The website, which is the primary platform for Americans to enroll in health insurance plans under the new law, will be shut down this weekend for maintenance.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has been a vocal critic of Obamacare and has been advocating for its defunding. However, the current situation has sparked a debate, with some questioning whether the difficulties experienced with the website's rollout could be used as an argument for defunding the law.\n\nPresident Obama, in an interview with The Associated Press, asked for patience as the technological glitches are being addressed. He acknowledged the high volume of visitors to the website and assured that the insurance does not start until January, giving ample time for the issues to be resolved.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) criticized the decision to disable the enrollment site for maintenance, stating that it confirms the launch of the healthcare law has been a disaster. Boehner and other Republican leaders have been vocal critics of Obamacare, with Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) stating that the law is not ready for prime time.\n\nDespite the issues, enrollments have been reported to be increasing, with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association stating that they expect enrollment to continue to rise. However, smaller insurers have yet to see any new customers due to the website's difficulties.\n\nTech experts suggest that the website's problems extend beyond simple traffic overages, with the Obama administration being criticized for underestimating the level of interest in the program. Designers have complained about the site's coding, instructions, and overall functionality.\n\nAs the website undergoes maintenance this weekend, it remains to be seen how the situation will evolve and whether it will impact the public's perception of Obamacare and Sen. Cruz's efforts to defund the law.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany Accuses Media of Lack of Journalistic Curiosity in Michael Flynn Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during a press briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized reporters for their perceived lack of interest in the criminal case surrounding former national security advisor Michael Flynn. The conversation ensued after CBS News Radio correspondent Steven Portnoy questioned McEnany about President Trump's recent comments suggesting that individuals should be jailed for the \"very obvious crime\" committed against Flynn.\n\nPortnoy, in his line of questioning, asked McEnany to outline the elements of this crime, to which she responded by referring to the Obama administration's unmasking activities. When Portnoy clarified the term, McEnany expressed her gratitude for the question, stating that there has been a lack of journalistic curiosity on this matter.\n\nMcEnany proceeded to detail the actions of the Obama administration, including the Democratic National Committee-funded Steele dossier, the FISA warrants granted to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, and the unmasking of Flynn by top Obama officials during the transition period between November 2016 and January 2017. She also highlighted an Oval Office meeting that took place just days before Trump's inauguration, during which President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and acting Attorney General Sally Yates discussed the unmasking matter.\n\nMcEnany emphasized the seriousness of the alleged wrongdoing in the Michael Flynn case, citing the FBI's notes suggesting a strategy to \"get him to lie\" and the unauthorized leak of Flynn's identity to the press, which she argued violated his Fourth Amendment rights. She expressed her belief that these questions have been ignored by the media for too long.\n\nPortnoy then asked McEnany to specify the \"crime,\" to which she reiterated that the leaking of Flynn's name to the press in January 2017 was the alleged offense.\n\nThe conversation then shifted to other alleged instances of wrongdoing within the administration, with McEnany mentioning the cases of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan. She accused these individuals of lying under oath in various instances.\n\nWhen Portnoy asked if the individuals McEnany listed were the ones the president thought should be \"in jail,\" McEnany pushed back, insisting that journalists should investigate the matters she had \"laid out.\" She emphasized that it was the job of reporters to answer the questions she had presented and hoped they would take the time to do so.",
    " Title: Trump's Controversial Remarks on Iraq War and 9/11 Spark Controversy at Republican Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Republican Party found itself in a state of discord during the recent primary debate, as Donald Trump made bold claims about the Iraq War and the 9/11 attacks. Trump's statements, while largely factual, sparked a heated response from other candidates, particularly Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump's assertion that the Iraq War was a disaster and that the Bush administration misled the country into invading Iraq, citing the absence of weapons of mass destruction, was met with resistance. Jeb Bush, in response, defended his brother's administration, stating that while Trump was building a reality TV show, his brother was building a security apparatus to keep the nation safe.\n\nThe debate took a more personal turn when Trump questioned George W. Bush's handling of the 9/11 attacks, stating that the World Trade Center came down during his brother's reign. This statement was met with boos from the crowd, which seemed to be heavily in favor of the Bush family. Rubio, a close rival of Bush, further defended the former president, blaming Bill Clinton for the 9/11 attacks, stating that he did not kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance.\n\nThe exchange seemed to go against Trump, with the audience appearing displeased with his comments. However, it is important to note that the in-studio audience was hand-picked by the state party and seemed to be heavily biased towards the Bush family.\n\nThe debate marked a significant shift in the primary politics, with Trump stepping outside the boundaries of traditional Republican Party rhetoric and facing backlash from the party establishment. This is a stark contrast to previous debates, where the candidates primarily focused on attacking each other, with the intention of facing Trump in a one-on-one battle later.\n\nTrump's claims, while controversial, are factually accurate. George W. Bush was indeed in office during the 9/11 attacks, and the Bush administration's claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were later found to be inaccurate. Trump's statement about the Bush administration's knowledge of the absence of WMDs in Iraq is more debatable, but it is undeniable that the WMD programs the White House claimed to exist were not found, and the administration's presentations of intelligence findings were selective and skewed.\n\nThis debate marked a turning point in the Republican primary, with the party establishment finally finding common ground to criticize Trump. However, it also highlighted the party's double standards, as statements that are factually accurate but politically sensitive are met with criticism, while fabricated or exaggerated claims are often met with silence or acceptance.",
    " Title: North Korea-South Korea Summit: Clarity on Denuclearization Remains Elusive\n\nArticle:\n\nAs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in prepare to meet next Friday, the topic of denuclearization remains the most contentious and least defined issue on the agenda. The term has been tossed around in recent weeks, from Seoul to Washington to Beijing, yet there is little agreement on what it means, and this lack of clarity could potentially lead to trouble in this week's summit as well as the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nSouth Korean officials and Chinese state media have reported that Kim is willing to discuss denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. On Thursday, President Moon announced that North Korea had not raised its long-standing demand for the withdrawal of US forces in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons, a concession that analysts greeted with skepticism.\n\nNorth Korean state media has yet to address the topic, and public statements by Kim have been vague. In Beijing on March 27, Kim said, \"It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,\" according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. This statement elicited a positive response from US President Donald Trump, who said there was now a \"good chance\" of denuclearization by North Korea.\n\nHowever, are Trump, Kim, and Moon talking about the same thing when it comes to North Korea giving up its nuclear capabilities? Over the past decade, denuclearization in North Korea has only ever meant one thing for the United States and South Korea: complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North Korean program.\n\n\"It's called CVID -- complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean program,\" said Josh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. The language has been used consistently by the United Nations Security Council in its resolutions condemning North Korea as far back as October 2006.\n\n\"Irreversible,\" in the practical sense, aims to ensure that the current facilities cannot be reactivated after they've been dismantled, Pollack said. Any denuclearization deal would need to include a series of \"verifiable\" steps for dismantling North Korea's program, carried out under the eyes of independent observers. Inspections could be carried out by an international body such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose inspectors were previously expelled by North Korea in 2002.\n\nFor decades, the US and South Korea have pushed for denuclearization in North Korea. In 1991, Pyongyang joined Seoul in signing a \"joint declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Two years later, North Korea pledged it would dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid.\n\nStill, the US government appears hopeful that the latest round of talks will be different. Trump on Wednesday offered a bullish view, insisting he's positioned to accomplish what his predecessors could not. However, he said he'd be willing to stand up and leave the highly anticipated summit should the meeting fall short of his expectations.\n\nOn South Korea's part, Moon denied on Thursday that there was any separation between what the North and the South meant by denuclearization. \"I do not think there is any difference in the concept,\" he said. When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised talks on denuclearization in Beijing in March, according to Xinhua, he did not speak of Pyongyang ending its program. He spoke of \"denuclearization on the (Korean) Peninsula.\"\n\n\"To Kim, denuclearization applies to the whole peninsula, which includes the South,\" David Maxwell, retired US Army Special Forces colonel and a fellow at the Institute of Korean American Studies, told CNN in March, prior to Moon's statement on Thursday. Experts said Pyongyang has long been expected to push for the American military presence across the border to be part of the discussion, a position Pollack said he was not sure had changed despite the South Korean president's remarks.\n\nAlthough the US has not stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea since 1992, Pollack said North Korea considered the US's mere presence on the peninsula a nuclear threat. \"They really are threatened by superior American and South Korean military power; they need nuclear weapons to try and prevent an invasion in their view,\" Pollack said. \"They feel the need to equate their nuclear program with the (US and South Korean) military alliance and claim the military alliance is a nuclear threat, when there's no real grounds for that.\"\n\nExperts said North Korea's apparent change of heart on the US military presence in South Korea seemed at best a temporary concession or, at worst, an attempt to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. \"The pessimistic interpretation is that Kim is intent on making concession after concession in private to show Moon that he is the reasonable one, with the expectation that Trump will ultimately be unable or unwilling to deliver,\" Pollack said.\n\nExperts told CNN the confusion over how much each side was willing to give and what their basic goals were for the summits make a positive outcome harder to see. \"The hopes of some officials in Washington that Kim would willingly give up his nuclear weapons program are 'utopian, really pie in the sky,'\" said Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea at the University of Leeds in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in March, Cathcart said given the ongoing \"disdain\" the Trump administration had shown for the Iran deal reached during President Barack Obama's administration, it was hard to see a similar, incremental plan getting support in Washington. The deal removed many of the sanctions on the Iranian government, in exchange for the Middle East country getting rid of the majority of its weapons program and uranium -- a key ingredient for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reality, argue analysts, is there simply too much distrust and too little understanding between the two sides to come to an agreement. \"They will affirm the principle of denuclearization as they did in 2005,\" said Pollack. \"And the implementation will be drawn up and never happen,\" he said.",
    " Title: Investigation Links Tsarnaev Brothers to 2011 Waltham Triple Murder, Preceding Boston Marathon Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing turn of events, forensic evidence has reportedly linked the Tsarnaev brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, to a 2011 unsolved triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts, two years before they were identified as suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\nSince the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the perpetrators of the Boston attacks, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office has been investigating the possibility that Tamerlan was behind the fatal stabbings of Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken in Waltham. Now, the office is also looking into whether both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar may have been involved in the unsolved murders, according to ABC News, which reported that \"mounting evidence\" and \"forensic hits\" make the brothers strong suspects.\n\nThe triple homicide of Mess, Weissman, and Teken has remained unsolved since their gruesome murders on September 11, 2011. At the time, the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office stated that they believed the three men knew their killer or killers. Tamerlan identified Mess as his \"best friend\" to the owner of the martial arts gym where he and Mess worked out, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nAttention turned to Tamerlan after family and friends of the victims in the Waltham murders recognized him following the bombings and recalled that he did not attend Mess' funeral and stopped making appearances at the gym, as reported by ABC News.\n\nOn the night of the murders, the three victims ordered food from Gerry's Italian Kitchen, but a deliverywoman heard no answer from inside the apartment when she rang the bell around 8:45 p.m. on September 11, 2011. The restaurant drew the attention of authorities nine days after the Boston bombings after empty fireworks with the gunpowder removed were found in a charity bin located in Gerry's parking lot, as reported by ABC News.\n\nResidents of Waltham and nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, told the network that they remembered Tamerlan delivering food, and that he and his brother worked as pizza deliverymen. However, the restaurant denied that either brother worked for Gerry's.\n\nThe Middlesex County District Attorney's Office stated late last month that it was looking into the possibility that Tamerlan was involved in the triple homicide. \"We are definitely going to pursue any new leads,\" spokeswoman Stephanie Guyotte said.\n\nThe news that the Tsarnaev brothers are strong suspects in the Waltham triple murders comes the same day it was revealed that Tamerlan was buried in Virginia. He died in a firefight with authorities on April 19, four days after the Boston bombings. His brother escaped but was captured later that same day by federal and state authorities in Watertown, where Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the backyard of a home.\n\nDzhokhar faces two terrorism-related charges in connection with the bombings, which killed three people. He has yet to be charged in the murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, who was allegedly killed by the brothers shortly before the firefight with authorities on April 18.",
    " Title: FBI Director James Comey Testifies: Clinton's Email Practices \"Not Truthful,\" Fueling Political Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated hearing on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey testified that some of Hillary Clinton's statements about her use of a private email server, made under oath, were \"not true.\" This revelation has fueled Republican questions about whether Clinton may have committed a felony.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging appearance before the House Oversight Committee, Comey also stated that Clinton's email practices put America's secrets at risk and her actions constituted \"the definition of carelessness.\"\n\nHowever, Comey defended the FBI's decision not to pursue charges, stating, \"We have no basis to conclude that [Clinton] lied to the FBI.\" Yet he acknowledged that lying under oath is a felony, as some Republicans point to statements she made last October before the House Benghazi committee, where she claimed that nothing she sent or received was marked classified.\n\nIn a pointed exchange with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), Comey clarified that \"That's not true... There was classified material emailed.\" He also stated that Clinton used multiple devices and did not return all work-related emails.\n\nDemocrats on the committee attempted to argue that Clinton may not have noticed or understood the classified markings in a few emails that bore them, bolstering any claim of plausible deniability. Comey did acknowledge that there is a question over whether Clinton was \"sophisticated enough\" to understand the significance of a particular classified marking at the time.\n\nFox News was first to report on a 2012 email that carried a classified code known as a \"portion marking\" when it was sent to Clinton's account.\n\nDuring the hearing, Clinton herself was at her Washington home, as her campaign responded regularly to hearing highlights. The campaign flagged that Comey acknowledged during the hearing that the portion markings themselves were not properly marked.\n\nRepublicans on the committee suggested a \"double standard\" was at play in the FBI's decision not to pursue charges. \"It seems to a lot of us that the average Joe... if they had done what you laid out in your statement, that they'd be in handcuffs,\" said House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).\n\nComey repeated his claim that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.\" He stated that while Clinton showed \"great carelessness,\" he did not see evidence she and those with whom she corresponded \"knew when they did it they were doing something that was against the law.\"\n\nComey also denied a double standard was at play, saying no one at the DOJ would have brought such a case against \"John Doe or Hillary Clinton\" based on the facts.\n\nDemocratic committee members slammed the hearing and described the criticism of Comey as political. \"Amazingly, some Republicans who were praising you just days ago... instantly turned against you,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).\n\nComey also addressed claims by Romanian hacker \"Guccifer\" that he breached Clinton's personal server. The hacker, Marcel Lehel Lazar, had told Fox News earlier this year that he easily accessed the server, but Comey said that when questioned, Guccifer admitted he lied about the breach.\n\nToward the end of the hearing, Comey would not answer directly when asked whether the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation. He also stated that Clinton gave individuals who were not cleared access to classified material, though a campaign spokesman countered that the attorneys who sorted through the emails had \"Top Secret-level clearance.\"\n\nThe hearing comes as Republicans turn up the pressure on both Comey and Clinton in the wake of the FBI's recommendation not to pursue charges in the email case. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, after receiving Comey's recommendation, on Wednesday declared the investigation over with no criminal charges issued.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) now wants Comey to release all of the unclassified findings from the agency's investigation. \"Right now, there are simply too many unanswered questions,\" Ryan wrote in a letter to Comey. \"The American people deserve to know exactly what your investigation uncovered and why the FBI came to the decision to recommend that no criminal charges be brought against Secretary Clinton.\"\n\nRyan also sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper urging him to deny Clinton access to classified information \"for the duration of her candidacy for president.\" \"I firmly believe this is necessary to reassure the public that our nation's secrets are secure,\" he said.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is hitting back repeatedly at Republicans, with a top spokesman calling the bid to deny her access to classified information a \"stunt\" and the campaign stating that Republicans had voiced \"nothing but confidence\" in Comey before his announcement earlier this week.\n\nComey's decision, and the way he delivered it, infuriated Republicans who felt that the FBI director, in his unusually detailed and critical televised statement Tuesday, had laid out a sufficient basis for prosecution. In a stinging assessment of her email practices as secretary of state, Comey rebuked Clinton and her aides for being \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information and contradicted many of the defenses and explanations she's put forward for months. But he also said there was no evidence anyone willfully or intentionally mishandled classified information.\n\nComey, who served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, was appointed in 2013 to a 10-year term as FBI director by President Barack Obama.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Divided on Obama's Surveillance Reform Proposals, Expressing Concerns Over Privacy and National Security\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of Sunday interviews, congressional leaders expressed mixed reactions to President Obama's plan to overhaul U.S. surveillance, with some expressing concern that the president did not go far enough to protect Americans' privacy, while others criticized a key part of the proposal as unworkable.\n\nThe leaders of both the House and Senate intelligence committees pushed back against the president's assertion that the government should cede control of how Americans' phone records are stored. President Obama, under pressure to calm the controversy over government spying, said Friday he wants bulk phone data stored outside the government to reduce the risk that the records will be abused. However, Obama did not specify who should have control of Americans' data and instead has directed the attorney general and director of national intelligence to find a solution within 60 days.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the decision had intensified a sense of uncertainty about the country's ability to root out terrorist threats. \"We really needed a decision on Friday, and what we got was lots of uncertainty,\" Rogers told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And just in my conversations over the weekend with intelligence officials, this new level of uncertainty is already having a bit of an impact on our ability to protect Americans by finding terrorists who are trying to reach into the United States.\"\n\nThe president also said he will require a special judge's advance approval before intelligence agencies can examine someone's data and will force analysts to keep their searches closer to suspected terrorists or organizations. However, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed concern that this could hinder the program's ability to provide instantaneous information to disrupt potential terrorist plots. \"The whole purpose of this program is to provide instantaneous information to be able to disrupt any plot that may be taking place,\" she told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nUnder the surveillance program, the NSA gathers phone numbers called and the length of conversations, but not the content of the calls. Obama said the NSA sometimes needs to tap those records to find people linked to suspected terrorists. However, the president said the bulk data eventually should be stored somewhere out of the government's hands. That could mean finding a way for phone companies to store the records, though some companies have balked at the idea, or it could mean creating a third-party entity to hold the records.\n\nFeinstein expressed concern that many Americans do not understand the ongoing threat of terrorism, 12 years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \"New bombs are being devised, new terrorists are emerging, new groups, actually, a new level of viciousness. And I think we need to be prepared,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers did praise the president for his defense of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. Rogers said, \"I thought it was very important that the president laid out no abuses, this was not an illegal program, it was not a rogue agency.\"\n\nThe surveillance programs have been under fire since former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden absconded with an estimated 1.7 million documents related to surveillance and other NSA operations, giving the documents to journalists around the world. Revelations in the documents sparked a furor over whether Americans have been giving up privacy protections in exchange for intelligence-gathering on terrorism.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has proposed ending the NSA's bulk data collection program, putting him at odds with his fellow Democrat Feinstein on the issue. Leahy suggested to \"Fox News Sunday\" that the chamber will continue to look at legislation to make its own changes, and the final product will be impacted by Attorney General Eric Holder's testimony on Jan. 29 before the Judiciary Committee.\n\nLeahy suggested he might not fight the president on allowing the NSA's surveillance programs to continue. \"I think we have a way that we could do this,\" he said. \"The question is, what is Congress going to do on this?... I just think that there should be an oversight... I believe in going after the bad guys... But you still have to have some checks and balances, or you have a government that can run amok.\"",
    " Title: Anticipated Interview of Stormy Daniels on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" Raises Questions About Alleged Affair with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the much-anticipated interview of adult-film actress Stormy Daniels with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" is set to air Sunday night, questions about what she could reveal about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump continue to swirl. The interview, shrouded in mystery, has left many in suspense about the details Daniels may disclose.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has alleged that she carried on an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid to remain silent about the matter as the real estate mogul sought the presidency in 2016. The interview could potentially shed light on whether she will discuss the details of the nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Trump and speak openly about the alleged affair, and what the segment could mean for her ongoing lawsuit.\n\nHere are seven things to watch for in Daniels's interview:\n\n1. The Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)\nDaniels has never publicly discussed the NDA that purportedly bars her from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump. However, a lawsuit filed by Daniels earlier this month confirmed the existence of such a document, arguing that it is invalid because it was never co-signed by Trump himself. Whether Daniels will discuss the details of the agreement in the \"60 Minutes\" interview remains to be seen.\n\n2. The Payment of $130,000\nDaniels has implied that she was paid $130,000 by Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about the alleged affair. Speaking openly about her claims would certainly violate the terms of the disputed NDA, and could subject Daniels to legal penalties.\n\n3. The Threats\nAvenatti has repeatedly hinted that video or photographic evidence of Daniels's alleged affair with Trump exists. In court papers filed earlier this month, Trump's lawyers said that Daniels could face up to $20 million in damages for violating the terms of the agreement. Avenatti has also hinted that Daniels may have been physically threatened in connection with the alleged affair with Trump.\n\n4. The Threatened NDA\nOne question that remains is whether Daniels could toss out the NDA completely in her \"60 Minutes\" interview, and provide details about her alleged relationship with the president. The last time she spoke about it was 2011, when she gave an interview to In Touch magazine that was not published until this year.\n\n5. Trump's Knowledge of the Payment\nCohen himself has acknowledged making the payment to Daniels, but has insisted that the money came from his personal funds and that Trump was never made aware of the transaction. However, Avenatti has argued otherwise, saying the fact that Cohen used a Trump Organization email address backs up his claim that the real estate mogul was aware of the transaction.\n\n6. Daniels's Motives\nDaniels's lawsuit claims she expressed interest in discussing the alleged affair publicly in 2016 after The Washington Post published a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump could be heard boasting about groping and kissing women without their permission. It was at this point that Cohen and Trump \"aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford,\" according to the lawsuit, which claims that the $130,000 payment and nondisclosure agreement soon followed.\n\n7. The Aftermath of the Interview\nAfter news broke that CBS intended to air the \"60 Minutes\" segment with Daniels, speculation swirled that Trump's lawyers would take legal action seeking to block the broadcast. Such legal action would have been unlikely to proceed, because courts rarely allow such prior restraint of speech, particularly regarding the news media. However, Trump's legal team has already signaled they're willing to fight Daniels on her claims. They reportedly asked for a temporary restraining order against her last month and have asked to transfer the lawsuit from California state court to a federal court in Los Angeles. But how Trump and his lawyers respond to the interview after it airs will be closely watched.",
    " Title: Karl Rove's Remarks on Hillary Clinton's Health Sparks Controversy, Bill Clinton Defends Wife's Health\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, former advisor to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove, has sparked controversy with his comments suggesting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be suffering from a brain injury. Clinton, who is seriously considering a second bid for the White House, suffered a blood clot in December 2012 after falling.\n\nRove, a Fox News Channel contributor, made these comments at a conference last week, according to the New York Post's Page Six gossip column. Rove questioned Clinton's health, referring to her wearing glasses after the incident, which are typically used for people with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nClinton's health has been a topic of discussion since the 2012 incident, where she was hospitalized for a three-day stay in New York. The incident prevented her from testifying before Congress about the deadly 2012 terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, raising questions from some Republicans.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton has come to his wife's defense, stating, \"Look, she works out every week, she is strong, she's doing great. As far as I can tell, she's in better shape than I am. She certainly seems to have more stamina now.\"\n\nRove, in response to the backlash, defended his comments, stating that it's legitimate to ask about a potential presidential candidate's health. However, his comments have been met with criticism from Democrats and Clinton's camp.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill stated, \"Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there are no words for this level of lying. She is 100%.\"\n\nThe 2012 incident was not the first time Clinton dealt with blood clots. In 2007, Clinton told the New York Daily News that while campaigning for Sen. Chuck Schumer in 1998, she suffered a large blood clot behind her right knee and had to be rushed to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Clinton also fell and fractured her right elbow as secretary of state in 2009 and was treated at George Washington University Hospital.\n\nRove's comments have reignited discussions about the politicization of a candidate's health, with some recalling similar tactics used during the 2008 campaign, where some Democrats made Republican presidential nominee John McCain's age an issue. Age has often been a campaign issue, with candidates' health records being a point of contention.\n\nAs Clinton mulls her decision, the GOP and pro-Republican outside groups have stepped up their attacks on Clinton, on everything from the Benghazi incident to the 1990s Monica Lewinsky scandal. If Clinton decides to run, she would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.",
    " Title: Trump's Healthcare Agenda Faces Legal Challenges as 2020 Election Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \"Obamacare,\" are facing setbacks in the courts, with two federal judges in Washington, D.C., blocking parts of his health care agenda this past week. The rulings could potentially complicate Trump's re-election campaign as the litigation process may take months, or even longer, to resolve, and there is no guarantee he will achieve the desired outcomes before the 2020 election.\n\nIn a significant blow, a federal judge in Texas ruled last December that the ACA is unconstitutional and should be struck down in its entirety. This ruling is now on appeal. At the urging of the White House, the Justice Department has stated it will support the Texas judge's position and argue that all of \"Obamacare\" must be abolished.\n\nThe most prominent case, the Texas case against the ACA, is likely to end up in the Supreme Court. However, the administration currently lacks a comprehensive health care plan, and there seems to be no consensus among Republicans in Congress regarding a replacement for the ACA.\n\nIn a separate development, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled that when Congress repealed the ACA's fines for being uninsured, it undermined the constitutional foundation of the entire law. This ruling is being appealed by attorneys general from Democratic-led states to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., last week blocked Medicaid work requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas approved by the Trump administration. The judge questioned whether the requirements were compatible with Medicaid's central purpose of providing \"medical assistance\" to low-income people. He found that administration officials failed to account for coverage losses and other potential harm, and sent the Health and Human Services Department back to the drawing board.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates last week struck down the administration's health plans for small business and sole proprietors, which allowed less generous benefits than required by the ACA. Bates found that administration regulations creating the plans were \"clearly an end-run\" around the Obama health law and also ran afoul of other federal laws governing employee benefits.\n\nThe administration has stated it disagrees but has not formally announced an appeal. The legal challenges to the administration's regulation that bars federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions and a rule that allows employers with religious and moral objections to opt out of offering free birth control to women workers as a preventive care service are also facing challenges in courts around the country.\n\nEconomist Gail Wilensky, who headed up Medicare under former Republican President George H.W. Bush, stated, \"Was this a good week for the Trump administration? No.\" Timothy Jost, a retired law professor who has followed the Obama health law since its inception, added, \"By the time these cases get through the courts, there simply isn't going to be time for the administration to straighten out any messes that get created, much less get a comprehensive plan through Congress.\"\n\nThe ACA, now nine years old, would be incredibly disruptive to uproot, according to Thomas Barker, an attorney with the law firm Foley Hoag, who served as a top lawyer at the federal Health and Human Services department under former Republican President George W. Bush. \"It seems to me that you can resolve this issue more narrowly than by striking down the ACA,\" Barker asserted.",
    " Title: Republican Gaetz Proposes Legislation to Deport Illegal Aliens During National Emergency Due to Communicable Disease\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at prioritizing American citizens during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz has introduced legislation that would require all illegal aliens under U.S. custody to be deported when the government declares a national emergency due to a communicable disease.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fox News on Wednesday, Gaetz criticized the actions of Democratic lawmakers, stating, \"It is unconscionable that at a time when we should be working together as Americans, Democrats are working to socially engineer our country and advance their legislative priorities.\"\n\nThe proposed bill, known as the Protect American Nationals During Emergencies by Mitigating the Immigration Crisis Act (PANDEMIC Act), is a response to legislation filed by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, both Democrats, which called on federal immigration authorities to release detainees and stop targeting illegal aliens who are believed to not pose a substantial public safety risk.\n\nThis is not the first time Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C. have asked federal authorities to scale back their operations amid the coronavirus pandemic. In March, a group of House Democrats, led by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, requested Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to halt all deportations in response to the virus.\n\nGaetz cited the actions taken by the Mexican government, which has nearly repatriated all of the illegal aliens in its custody to prevent migrant detention centers from becoming hotbeds for outbreaks. \"I think we should love our country at least as much as Mexico loves theirs,\" the Florida lawmaker said.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has scaled back its immigration enforcement efforts in some ways, it has also increased enforcement in others. ICE announced it would focus more on individuals who pose a greater public safety threat, and the agency has released hundreds of immigrants at risk of coronavirus complications. However, the administration has also increased enforcement operations in other areas, such as closing the northern and southern borders off to all \"non-essential\" traffic, immediately turning back illegal entrants, and President Donald Trump has threatened visa sanctions on any country that refuses to accept deportees from the United States.

    " Title: House Oversight Committee Accuses FBI of Stonewalling Investigation into IRS and Conservative Group Targeting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's chief investigator, Rep. Darrell E. Issa, has accused the FBI of obstructing an inquiry into whether the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeted the conservative group True the Vote for special scrutiny. In a letter to FBI Director James B. Comey Jr., Issa and fellow committee member Rep. Jim Jordan are threatening subpoenas to compel the release of information from the FBI.\n\nIssa and Jordan, both Republicans, are leading the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's IRS inquiry. They claim that the FBI has refused to provide any documents related to its own investigation into the IRS, which began in the days following an auditor's report revealing the tax agency had improperly targeted tea party groups for special scrutiny.\n\nThe FBI's six-month-long investigation has yielded no public information, and the congressmen allege that the FBI rescinded an offer for an in-person briefing with the assistant director in charge of the investigation after consulting with the Justice Department, suggesting political meddling.\n\nIn their letter to Comey, Issa and Jordan warned that if they do not receive the information, they will use \"compulsory\" means. The FBI declined to comment on the congressional letter, stating that it would respond in writing. The FBI did confirm that its investigation into the IRS is ongoing.\n\nThe Justice Department referred inquiries about its involvement to the FBI. Issa, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been leading an investigation for months into the IRS's targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nIn May, the IRS's internal auditor reported that the agency asked inappropriately probing questions and delayed conservative groups' applications\u2014in some cases for three years. After the revelations, the IRS promised to clean up its operations, and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. ordered the FBI to open a criminal investigation.\n\nHowever, one of the conservative activists whose groups were targeted, Catherine Engelbrecht, claimed that she and her husband faced an occupational safety investigation into their company, an IRS audit of their company, repeated rounds of IRS questions about True the Vote's activities, and six inquiries from the FBI about the King Street Patriots\u2014including general inquiries and specific questions about someone who attended a group meeting.\n\nTrue The Vote was granted nonprofit status this fall, but the King Street Patriots is still waiting. The group received another round of questions from the IRS in August, according to attorney Cleta Mitchell, who represents True the Vote and the ActRight Legal Foundation.\n\nIssa and Jordan began pressing the FBI for information when former Director Robert S. Mueller III was unable to provide any details, just days after Holder assigned the FBI to investigate. The congressmen wanted to be kept informed as part of their oversight duties. In September, they sent a letter asking for more information on the broad IRS investigation and why the FBI had been looking into True the Vote and the King Street Patriots.\n\nIn response, the FBI provided a letter that did not mention Engelbrecht's situation and gave brief details about the broader IRS investigation. The FBI stated that Assistant Director Valeria Parlave, who oversees investigations opened by the Washington field office, was in charge, and had 11 special agents and one forensic accountant working for her.\n\nThe FBI stated that the documents Issa is seeking are part of the ongoing investigation and therefore \"cannot be released at this time.\" In a follow-up conversation with committee investigators last month, FBI official Monique Kelso refused to provide documents but offered to make Parlave available for a briefing, according to the committee.\n\nWhen the investigators emailed to follow up, one of her colleagues, Kirk Melquist, said he had run the idea by the Justice Department and was awaiting guidance. In a follow-up conversation on November 20, Kelso rescinded the offer of a briefing, according to Issa and Jordan.\n\nThe congressmen allege that Kelso denied receiving pressure from the Justice Department, but Melquist would not say one way or the other. They suggest that senior Department of Justice officials may have inappropriately interfered. The two lawmakers sent copies of their latest letter to the two top senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, urging them to give extra scrutiny to Peter Kadzik, one of the Justice Department officials Kelso informed of the committee's request for a briefing. Kadzik is up for a promotion within the Justice Department, and his nomination must pass Senate scrutiny.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Enters Day One with No Progress in Funding Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first day of government shutdown negotiations has yielded no progress, as the White House and Congress remain at an impasse over funding for a border wall. The shutdown, fueled by President Trump's border wall-fueled demands, has left more than 25 percent of the government unfunded, with significant impacts expected to be felt by government workers starting Wednesday.\n\nOn Saturday, President Trump met with some Republican lawmakers at the White House, while Congress adjourned without taking any action. The House was recessed, preventing any floor action, and the Senate, which was in session for over three hours, saw minimal activity. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that lawmakers would be sent home until Thursday, signaling that the shutdown will last at least until then.\n\n\"It's really simple,\" McConnell said. \"Sixty votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and President Trump's signature. That's what we need.\" However, the two sides appear to be moving further apart, not closer.\n\nPresident Trump canceled his plans to spend Christmas in Florida, and the first lady will return to Washington to spend the holiday. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer stated that Mr. Trump must abandon his border wall demands before Democrats will agree to reopen the government. \"If you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Saturday.\n\nDemocrats are confident that the president, who has long threatened a government shutdown, will be blamed by voters. Mr. Trump, for his part, criticized the media, stating there was a lot of \"fake news\" about the shutdown, but did not specify what he objected to in the coverage.\n\nThe shutdown has affected about 800,000 employees in the departments and agencies that lost funding. Of these, 420,000 are deemed essential and must continue working, though they will not be paid until the shutdown ends. The remaining 380,000 employees have been furloughed. The Senate passed a bill on Friday to guarantee that furloughed workers will still be paid for the time they were out of work, but this legislation has not passed the House.\n\nThe chief sticking point in negotiations is President Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding. The White House had signaled earlier this week that the president would sign a bill without it, but he reversed himself on Thursday and vowed a veto unless he received his funding for the border wall. Most Republicans have rallied around Mr. Trump, while Democrats appear nearly unanimous in their opposition to him.",
    " Title: Conservative New York Times Columnist Bret Stephens Deactivates Twitter Account After Exchange with George Washington University Professor\n\nNew York, August 27 - Conservative New York Times columnist Bret Stephens announced the deactivation of his Twitter account on Tuesday, following an exchange with a George Washington University professor, David Karpf.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Stephens expressed his disdain for the social media platform, stating, \"Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity.\" He further apologized for any harm caused and thanked his followers.\n\nThe exchange between Stephens and Karpf began after the Times columnist took offense to a tweet by Karpf, in which he referred to Stephens as a \"bedbug.\" The reference was made in response to reports of a bedbug outbreak in the Times' midtown Manhattan newsroom on Monday.\n\nIn an email to Karpf and the provost of George Washington University, Stephens expressed his dismay at the professor's choice of words, stating, \"Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a 'bedbug.' I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people\u2014people they've never met\u2014on Twitter.\"\n\nStephens then invited Karpf to visit his home, meet his wife and children, and call him a \"bedbug\" to his face. He challenged the professor to show \"genuine courage and intellectual integrity\" and promised to be courteous during the encounter.\n\nKarpf shared the email on Twitter, which quickly went viral. In a subsequent tweet, Karpf commented, \"It got 9 likes and 0 retweets. I did not @ him. He does not follow me. He is deeply offended that I called him a metaphorical bedbug.\"\n\nKarpf's tweet received more than 8,000 retweets and over 52,000 likes.\n\nStephens, who is also an MSNBC contributor, later clarified that his offer to Karpf to visit his home was a \"standing invitation\" and that the professor could also bring his spouse.\n\nThe exchange between the two has sparked a debate online, with some criticizing Stephens for his response and others defending his actions. The New York Times has not issued a statement regarding the incident.",
    " Title: President Obama's Strategy in the Face of Sequester: A Test of Public Engagement and Bipartisan Compromise\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Obama's strategy in the face of the sequester, a series of automatic spending cuts, has become a test of public engagement and bipartisan compromise as the crisis deepens. With the sequester now in effect, the president finds himself in an awkward position, rooting for the predicted impact of the cuts while simultaneously attempting to mitigate their real-world impact.\n\nThe $85 billion in cuts, which are coursing their way through the federal bureaucracy, will have a significant impact on various government services, including military spending, mental health services, and border security. The president needs this impact to be felt, as it is intended to exert political pressure on Republicans over spending cuts that has been absent to date.\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\" White House economic adviser Gene Sperling stated, \"My belief is that as this pain starts to gradually spread to communities affected by military spending, to children who need mental health services, to people who care about our border security, I believe that more Republican colleagues who are concerned about this harm to their constituents will choose bipartisan compromise on revenue-raising tax reform with serious entitlement reform.\"\n\nRepublicans, too, face challenges in dealing with the sequester, both in substance and messaging. House Speaker John Boehner has expressed concerns about the sequester's impact on Defense spending, and in a recent interview, he questioned whether the sequester would \"hurt the economy or not.\"\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) has kept the door open for a \"big agreement\" on the budget, while other Republicans, including many aligned with the tea party, view the sequester as a step toward fiscal sanity. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) last week called the sequester \"a big victory\" for the GOP.\n\nThe one point of contention that remains unyielding among Republicans is taxes. Any plan to replace the sequester, the president is saying, must include ridding the tax code of loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy.\n\nIn a rare admission, the president acknowledged during a recent press conference that he lacks the direct powers to address the current state of affairs in Washington. \"What more do you think I should do?\" he asked reporters, not entirely rhetorically.\n\nWith no easy answers in sight, all the president and his critics can do is wait, as the policy, designed to be so awful as to force an alternative, unfolds. The question remains: Can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing?",
    " Title: Miss Michigan 2019, Kathy Zhu, Stripped of Title over Political Views Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nMiss Michigan 2019 winner Kathy Zhu has been disqualified from the Miss World America (MWA) pageant following a dispute over her conservative political views. In a letter obtained by Zhu and shared on her Twitter account, MWA accused her of violating the organization's rules regarding good character, citing several social media posts containing offensive, insensitive, and inappropriate content.\n\nThe letter stated that Zhu's refusal to try on a hijab in 2018, her tweet about black-on-black gun violence, and \"insensitive\" statistical tweets were the primary reasons for her disqualification.\n\nZhu's tweet about refusing to wear an Islamic headscarf was in response to a Muslim woman attempting to put a hijab on her head during World Hijab Day at her college campus in 2018. Townhall.com reports that Zhu argued the Islamic headscarf is used to oppress women in certain Muslim countries, stating, \"There is a 'try a hijab on' booth at my college campus. So you're telling me that it's now just a fashion accessory and not a religious thing? Or are you just trying to get women used to being oppressed under Islam?\"\n\nMWA also took issue with a tweet by Zhu that read, \"Did you know the majority of black deaths are caused by other blacks? Fix problems within your own community before blaming others,\" according to Detroit Free Press.\n\nZhu defends the two now-deleted tweets, attributing their removal to the stripping of her title. \"I am so glad the story got brought into the public eye and the media because this is so much bigger than pageantry. This is about an organization discriminating against people with different opinions. Calling people racist when they\u2019re not. Little attacks like that really diminish the value and truth of the word racism,\" Zhu said.\n\n\"There should not just be diversity of skin color, there should be diversity of thought and of mindset, political affiliation, and I'm so glad to be the voice of this right now,\" Zhu added.\n\nZhu expressed her emotions upon receiving the messages from MWA, stating she was crying when she first saw them but is thankful for the support she has received. \"I hope that other pageant organizations can really learn from this story and situation. Do not discriminate others based on opinions. I will still stand firm, stand my ground, and I'm going to still continue to fight for what I believe in,\" she added.",
    " Title: Climate Change and Typhoon Haiyan: A Closer Look at the Science and Reality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, a powerful and devastating storm that struck the Philippines, the global community is once again grappling with the complex issue of climate change and its potential role in extreme weather events. While the tragedy has sparked calls for urgent action to combat climate change, it is crucial to approach the issue with a balanced and factual perspective.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to acknowledge the human suffering caused by Typhoon Haiyan. The loss of life and destruction of property is a horrific event, and the Philippine's representative to the United Nations' emotional plea for action is understandable. However, as Bjorn Lomborg, a renowned environmental economist, has repeatedly pointed out, the cost of implementing the measures advocated by those seeking to \"stop this madness\" would be astronomical, potentially causing economic collapse and yielding marginal results at best.\n\nThe current reality is that carbon emissions in the United States are at 1994 levels, and emissions have decreased in most parts of the world due to the economic downturn. Furthermore, the global warming pause, where warming has stagnated for ten years, has led some climate scientists to predict a potential 20-year pause in warming. Given this context, attributing a single event, such as Typhoon Haiyan, to climate change is challenging.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that hurricanes and tornadoes are currently at record low levels in the United States. This year, as of Tuesday morning, no hurricanes have formed, and tornado activity in 2013 is also at record low levels. Heatwaves are fewer and milder than last year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The causes of these phenomena are attributed to factors such as luck, shifts in the high-altitude jet stream, African winds, and dust.\n\nThis raises the question of whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions, often blamed for climate change, are the primary drivers of extreme weather events. Given the ongoing debate about the science of climate change, it is prudent to remain open to alternative explanations for local climatic events.\n\nIn conclusion, while the tragedy of Typhoon Haiyan is undeniable, it is essential to approach the issue of climate change with a nuanced understanding of the science and the reality of the situation. The debate about climate change is far from settled, and there is much to learn about our climate and its complex interactions. Until the science is more definitive, it is premature to attribute a single event, such as Typhoon Haiyan, to climate change.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Permanent Tax Cuts Legislation Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have unveiled a trio of bills, collectively known as Tax Reform 2.0, aimed at making permanent the individual tax cuts from last year's tax overhaul. The legislation, announced on Monday, seeks to highlight the Republican party's role in the current economic growth and remind voters of the tax cuts ahead of the November midterm elections.\n\nThe bills, if passed, would make permanent the individual tax cuts from the 2017 tax package, preventing tax increases for individuals in eight years. The legislation also aims to boost incentives for retirement savings, offer more lenient tax treatment to startups and small businesses.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which announced the bills, stated, \"Under our new system, we're seeing incredible job growth, bigger paychecks, and a tax code that works on behalf of families and American businesses. Now it's time to ensure we never let our tax code become so outdated again.\"\n\nThe bills are expected to face a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, making them more of a political statement than a policy accomplishment. The lack of a budget to protect the bills from the filibuster further complicates their passage.\n\nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, the cuts would add at least $650 billion to the deficit over the next decade, with most of the savings benefiting wealthier Americans.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the tax reform, with Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on Ways and Means, stating, \"The first Republican tax law hasn't helped workers get ahead. Wages aren't keeping up with inflation, costs for health insurance and prescription drugs are rising, and companies are laying people off and shipping jobs overseas.\"\n\nThe tax reform is one of the significant legislative accomplishments of a Congress controlled by Republicans since President Trump took office. The party is counting on the tax cuts to persuade voters to keep them in power.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 70 percent of respondents said the U.S. economy is \"excellent\" or \"good,\" matching the poll's record high. However, President Trump's approval rating stood at just 38 percent in the same poll, dragged down by what voters saw as personal failings of lack of honesty and leadership.\n\nThe tax reform's impact on the economy has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that the tax cuts have contributed to the current economic growth, while others claim the growth would have occurred regardless of the tax cuts. The White House has pointed to increased small-business optimism, business confidence, real sales, real private nonresidential fixed investment, and core capital goods orders and shipments as evidence of the tax cuts' positive impact.\n\nHowever, the White House has also faced criticism for inaccurate statements regarding economic data. On Monday, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett had to correct President Trump's tweet stating that GDP growth was higher than the unemployment rate for the first time in over 100 years, when the statistic is actually incorrect.\n\nThe tax reform's passage remains uncertain, with Democrats criticizing the legislation as disproportionately benefiting wealthier Americans and adding to the nation's debt. The midterm elections in November will likely determine the fate of the Tax Reform 2.0 bills.",
    " Title: Analyzing Donald Trump's Unconventional Leadership Style in the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe management style of President Donald Trump in the White House has been compared to his approach in running his family business, characterized by a lack of rigid organization and a small, loyal staff. This style, however, has yielded mixed results, with the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the withdrawal of Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder from the confirmation process.\n\nDavid Cay Johnston, author of The Making of Donald Trump, notes that Trump's business had a small staff and that he was the absolute ruler of his business empire. This is a stark contrast to the White House, where Trump now finds himself in charge of a vast federal bureaucracy that he and some of his Cabinet nominees are not familiar with.\n\nTrump's improvisational style has led to upheavals in longstanding foreign policy doctrine, such as questioning the two-state solution in the Middle East, and his bristling at the idea that presidential orders can be blocked by a federal judge.\n\nJohnston describes Trump's approach as \"seat of the pants,\" and while he contends he is a great negotiator, Johnston asserts that Trump is not a great negotiator but rather a skilled promoter of the idea that he is.\n\nThis week, the White House was tested when Flynn resigned after making false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Despite knowing about the false statements for more than 3 weeks before Flynn quit, the White House maintains that the president acted decisively.\n\nTrump's \"You're fired\" catchphrase from The Apprentice is well-known, but former employees say he does not enjoy firing people in real life. The president also seems comfortable with competing personalities and power centers in the White House, which can generate friction and palace intrigue.\n\nChris Demuth, a veteran of the Reagan White House, believes that this competition can lead to wiser decisions, as Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt deliberately pitted staff members against each other. Demuth also shares the president's view that unpredictability is a good thing.\n\nHowever, unless unpredictability is calibrated, it can throw friends off balance, making it harder for the president to advance his agenda. Johnston, who launched the news site DCReport.org, notes that running government is a complex process that requires coordination and knowledge of how to achieve it. Trump, according to Johnston, does not have those skills.\n\nThe administration is less than a month old, and adjustments could still be made. After the botched rollout of the travel ban, the White House chief of staff reportedly drew up a checklist to ensure future initiatives go through the proper channels. Trump, the improviser, often seems impatient with checklists. But as Trump once said on The Apprentice, it's important to adapt.\n\nThe question remains whether Trump can learn the lessons of his political apprenticeship and adapt his unconventional leadership style to the demands of the White House.",
    " Title: U.S. Abstention from U.N. Vote on Israel Settlements Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and criticism, the United States abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote on Friday, allowing a resolution condemning Israel's settlement expansion in the disputed West Bank to pass. The decision, made by the outgoing Obama administration, has been met with swift and sharp criticism from U.S. Republicans, Jewish leaders, and Israeli officials.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry defended the administration's decision, stating that the objective was to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians, a position that every U.S. administration for decades has agreed is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace. Kerry emphasized that the two-state solution is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors, and freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people.\n\nThe resolution, put forward by four nations, was a departure from the U.S.'s usual veto of such measures. In 2007, the U.S. used its veto power on a similar matter, but circumstances have changed dramatically since then, according to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power. The resolution was adopted with 14 votes in favor, after the U.S. abstained, marking the first resolution the Security Council has adopted on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador Danny Danon described the U.S.'s abstention as a \"shameful resolution\" and expressed confidence that the new U.S. administration and the incoming U.N. Secretary General will usher in a new era in terms of the U.N.'s relationship with Israel. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the administration for appearing to undermine America's historic Middle East ally, while former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called the administration's move \"a big mistake.\"\n\nThe resolution calls on Israel to \"immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in occupied territories, including East Jerusalem,\" and repeats the longstanding U.N. position that all settlements on land Israel conquered in 1967 are illegal under international law. Israel believes it has the right to expand settlements in the disputed territories as populations within them expand, while Palestinians do not believe the settlements should exist at all.\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to abstain from the vote has been criticized for imposing outside positions on Israel without allowing them to negotiate directly. Former U.S. Mission to the U.N. spokesman Ric Grenell, now a \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor, described the move as \"shameful\" and argued that it will make it harder to find a peaceful solution. The U.S., as one of the council's five permanent members, has veto power and has used it to shield Israel from condemnatory resolutions in the past. However, the Obama administration has long made clear its opposition to Israeli settlement-building in occupied territory, even though it provides Israel with tens of billions annually in assistance.",
    " Title: Pelosi Urges Boehner to Initiate Debate on Military Force Authorization for President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has called on Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to initiate a debate in Congress over granting President Barack Obama a new authorization to use military force against Islamic militants. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Pelosi expressed her frustration that Congress has yet to engage in a discussion on the matter, despite widespread public concern.\n\nPelosi stated, \"Everybody in the country's talking about it except for us.\" This statement was made during a breakfast meeting with reporters and editors in New York on Tuesday.\n\nCongress recently passed Obama's plan to arm and train Syrian rebels in a bipartisan vote. This authorization is set to expire in December during the post-election session of Congress. Boehner, who has expressed a willingness to call Congress back into session to vote on authorizing broader military action, has stated that it is ultimately up to Obama to make the request.\n\nPelosi criticized the current approach, stating, \"Since when do we sit around waiting, using the excuse he didn't ask? No, if you want to have an authorization that has any constraints on the president, you don't wait for him to write it.\"\n\nThe debate over the extent of the president's power to combat Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria is expected to create divisions within both parties and both chambers of Congress. Democrats, led by Pelosi, strongly oppose the use of U.S. ground troops in the fight against Islamic State, while Republicans, particularly in the House, advocate for a more robust response, including the possibility of ground forces.\n\nYesterday, Boehner stated that the U.S. may have \"no choice\" but to deploy American troops if other nations fail to do so. \"These are barbarians,\" Boehner said on ABC's \"This Week\" program, referring to Islamic State.\n\nPelosi also expressed concern about a potential congressional debate over the nation's borrowing limit, which is set to expire as early as March. \"I'm very concerned about the debt ceiling because many Americans don't understand the importance of meeting the nation's borrowing obligations,\" Pelosi said.\n\nDespite the challenging election year for Democrats, Pelosi predicted that her party will win a majority in Congress in 2016.",
    " Title: Discontent with Obamacare Exchanges: High Prices and Technical Issues Deter Half of Users from Re-enrolling\n\nArticle:\n\nDisenchantment with high prices and ongoing technical issues has led more than half of households that utilized an Obamacare exchange last year to express reluctance about revisiting the portal during the upcoming sign-up period, according to a survey released Monday by Bankrate.com.\n\nThe survey, which polled 1,000 adults, revealed that 51 percent of respondents do not wish to use HealthCare.gov or their state-run insurance marketplaces again. This less-than-enthusiastic response comes as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) faces another high-profile legal battle less than two weeks before the open enrollment period begins anew.\n\nThe primary concern for 40 percent of respondents was the \"much higher prices for health plans\" on the exchanges this year. A quarter of respondents cited the persisting issue of uninsured individuals despite the ACA's implementation, while 21 percent pointed to the technological problems that plagued the federal Obamacare website and some state-run exchanges during the initial rollout.\n\nDespite the pessimistic outlook, more than half of those surveyed reported having a positive experience during the previous enrollment period, while 43 percent reported a negative one.\n\nThe Obama administration aims to continue reducing the nation's uninsured rate during the second round of enrollment, which runs from November 15 to February 15. To meet congressional scorekeepers' target of 13 million enrollees in 2015, they will need approximately 7 million existing enrollees to renew their plans and nearly 6 million new enrollees.\n\nThose who can afford coverage but choose not to obtain it may be subject to a tax penalty unless they qualify for an exemption. If these individuals opt out of the exchanges, it may be because they do not qualify for income-based subsidies and instead shop in the off-exchange market.\n\nGerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told Bankrate.com, \"That's a reasonable alternative because the law regulates those so-called'mirror' policies to where there aren't significant differences. But I don't think there are any huge bargains there.\"\n\nOn Monday, 18 states filed a legal brief to oppose high-profile lawsuits that claim Obamacare subsidies should only be available to states that established their own exchanges. The states argued that there is no plausible reason to believe that Congress intended such a drastic outcome.\n\nThe case is currently being considered by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, with oral arguments scheduled for December. Opponents of the Affordable Care Act argue that the law reserved income-based credits for customers who use an exchange \"established by the state.\" They interpret this to mean the 16 exchanges set up by the states, and no others. However, the Obama administration contends that the law's framers intended the federal government to act as a stand-in for states that did not wish to run their own insurance portals.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit is considering the case after a three-judge panel ruled against the administration earlier this year. On the same day, the Fourth Circuit ruled in favor of the administration, creating a split in the federal appeals courts. The Supreme Court is expected to decide in the coming days whether it will take up the Fourth Circuit case or wait for the D.C. Circuit's decision, potentially eliminating the circuit split and reducing the need for high-court review.",
    " Title: US-China Summit in California: A Focus on Personal Relationship and Strategic Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming summit between President Obama and China's new president, Xi Jinping, in southern California this weekend has sparked debate among experts regarding its potential impact. While the leaders are expected to discuss a range of issues, including military and corporate cybersecurity, North Korea, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and US-China trade, the emphasis on building a personal relationship between the two leaders has left some skeptics unimpressed.\n\nDean Cheng, a research fellow in Chinese political and security affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, expressed his doubts, stating that \"tone\" and personal rapport matter little in defending national interests. He anticipates little of substance from the summit at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California.\n\nHowever, the informal and untested format of the summit, chosen to allow the two leaders to get to know each other and cover a broad agenda with candor, is built on the premise that the dynamics between leaders do matter, especially in the critical and rapidly evolving relationship between the United States and a rising China.\n\nAlthough Obama and Xi have met before, this will be their first summit as presidents. Xi formally assumed China's presidency in March. US officials argue that the informal summit format allows the two leaders to build a personal relationship that will lay the groundwork for US-China relations in the years ahead.\n\nSome China experts see the upside of trying out a new summit format with the Chinese, particularly with a leader who has shown signs of being less rigid and more open to free-wheeling discussion than his predecessors. Christopher Johnson, a senior adviser and the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, believes that the informal setting offers a relaxed atmosphere where the two leaders can focus on developing personal rapport and exchange views on the strategic challenges facing the bilateral relationship.\n\nEven Chinese officials are cautious about expectations for specific agreements or formal steps forward on the issues discussed. However, they have been open to the less structured format, perhaps in part because Xi is eager to demonstrate a maturing China ready for the \"new type of great power relationship\" that Xi is calling for between the US and China.\n\nUS officials interpret Xi's desire to refashion US-China relations as recognition of the potential pitfalls the two countries face as China asserts itself on the world economic and security stages, and as the US reasserts its role in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nObama has said he intends to place emphasis on the cybersecurity issue, especially after the recent Pentagon-commissioned report that warned that Chinese hackers have accessed the designs for dozens of key US weapons systems. The US and China will also discuss North Korea, with US officials describing Obama as particularly interested in probing recent signs of a growing Chinese willingness to challenge Pyongyang over its security provocations and funding schemes related to its nuclear program.\n\nThe US has recently had encouraging discussions with the Chinese on reining in North Korea, US officials say. They point out that these \"good discussions\" have taken place even as the two countries have aired their disagreements on cybersecurity issues. This ability to pursue encouraging and problematic discussions at the same time is evidence that the US-China relationship is evolving into something more open and developed, these officials say. It's also the kind of evidence that suggests that the two powers may be ready for the \"open and serious discussions\" Obama and Xi will have ample time for in Rancho Mirage.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Louisiana Abortion Law, Potentially Impacting Abortion Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court has agreed to take on a Louisiana abortion case that could reveal the court's stance on abortion rights in the midst of the 2020 presidential campaign. The justices will examine a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The law is similar to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, before the addition of President Donald Trump's two high court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who have shifted the court to the right.\n\nThe court's new term begins on Monday, but arguments in the Louisiana case will not take place until the winter. A decision is likely to come by the end of June, four months before the presidential election.\n\nIn February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from taking effect, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court's four liberal justices to put it on hold. Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were among the four conservatives who would have allowed the law to take effect.\n\nThe Louisiana case, along with a separate appeal over an Indiana ultrasound requirement for women seeking an abortion, were the most significant of hundreds of pending appeals the justices considered when they met in private on Tuesday. Both cases involve the standard first laid out by the court in 1992 that while states can regulate abortion, they can't do things that place an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nLouisiana abortion providers and a district judge who initially heard the case said one or maybe two of the state's three abortion clinics would have to close under the new law. There would be at most two doctors who could meet its requirements, they said. However, the appeals court in New Orleans rejected those claims, doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying the doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals.\n\nIn January, the full appeals court voted 9-6 not to get involved in the case, setting up the Supreme Court appeal. The Hope Medical Group clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, and two doctors whose identities are not revealed said in their appeal that the justices should strike down the law without even holding arguments because the decision so clearly conflicts with the Texas ruling from 2016.\n\nThere was no action on a third abortion-related appeal that involves a challenge to a Chicago ordinance that stops protesters from getting within 8 feet (2.4 meters) of people entering abortion clinics and other health care facilities without their consent. Anti-abortion activists had challenged the Chicago law as a violation of their free speech rights. The federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the law, though grudgingly.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld a similar Colorado law in 2000, but in 2014 struck down a Massachusetts provision that set a fixed 35-foot (10.7-meter) buffer zone outside abortion clinics.\n\nAlso on Friday, the court agreed to hear an appeal by energy companies and the Trump administration asking the court to overturn an appeals court ruling and reinstate a permit to allow construction of a natural gas pipeline through two national forests, including parts of the Appalachian Trail. The 605-mile (970-kilometer) pipeline would begin in West Virginia and travel through parts of Virginia and North Carolina. The proposed route, which the administration had approved, would include the George Washington and Monongahela National Forests, as well as a right-of-way across the Appalachian Trail.",
    " Title: Primary Elections: A Preview of Tuesday's Voting in Six States and Key Races to Watch\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in six states will head to the polls for primary elections, marking one of the most significant primary election days of the year. NPR's Lynn Neary provides a preview of the upcoming races, with insights from NPR's political editor, Charlie Mahtesian.\n\nThis is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Lynn Neary. Primary races are picking up ahead of the midterm elections this fall. On Tuesday, voters in six states will go to the polls, making it one of the most important primary election days of the year.\n\nAmong the races to watch is a Tea Party challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. To give us a lay of the land is NPR political editor Charlie Mahtesian.\n\nNEARY: So, I guess the most closely watched primary coming up this Tuesday is the race in Kentucky, where Senator McConnell has been fighting off a challenge from the right. So tell us more about that.\n\nMAHTESIAN: Well, of all the primary elections this year, the McConnell race is probably the most important and also the most highly anticipated because in some ways, Senator McConnell is the most powerful Republican in Washington. And so now he's matched up against a Tea Party challenger named Matt Bevin, who is a businessman and political newcomer.\n\nMcConnell represents the face of the Republican establishment in a time of serious unrest at the conservative grassroots level. And Kentucky, remember, is the state where Rand Paul made his significant victory in 2010 with Tea Party support.\n\nNEARY: Senator McConnell has raised a lot of money, $20 million. Is he worried?\n\nMAHTESIAN: Well, he's less worried than he was before. The most recent poll shows Senator McConnell has a fairly comfortable lead over Bevin. And I think it would be considered a pretty ground-rattling upset if Bevin was somehow able to pull this off. One of McConnell's problems in Kentucky has been that his approval ratings are not great.\n\nBut what's happened is that Senator McConnell has run a very focused and a nearly flawless campaign. Bevin, on the other hand, as a political newcomer, has made some rookie mistakes. And against an astute and sharp-elbowed politician like Mitch McConnell, you really can't afford any errors like that.\n\nNEARY: Kentucky is not the only important Senate race. What else should we be keeping our eye on?\n\nMAHTESIAN: Well, the Georgia and the Oregon Republican primaries are the other big Senate races to follow. The Georgia primary is a big, sloppy, messy affair that features a pretty crowded Republican field and is taking place against the backdrop of lots of Republican angst about the quality of the candidate the party is going to nominate.\n\nAnd that anxiety is because Democrats are all but certain to nominate Michelle Nunn, who's the daughter of former senator Sam Nunn. And she's widely considered to be a top-notch candidate. Now in Oregon, the primary field is a lot smaller - just two candidates there. One of them is state representative Jason Conger, who went from homelessness to Harvard Law School.\n\nAnd the other is Dr. Monica Wehby, who is a pediatric neurosurgeon. There are some conservatives who think Dr. Wehby is not quite conservative enough, especially on abortion. But she's captured the imagination of some in the state and also some in the national Republican establishment who think a woman candidate with her profile is exactly what they need to win in a blue state like Oregon.\n\nNEARY: So what about House elections? Polls are suggesting voters are in a pretty cranky mood. Should incumbents be worried?\n\nMAHTESIAN: Well, so far, only a handful of states have held their primaries, but not a single incumbent has lost yet. And most of them are winning pretty comfortably or they're simply uncontested. So that tells you a little something about the environment right now.\n\nGranted, we're just talking about primary elections here, meaning that congressmen are only going in front of their own party voters right now. I think we'll probably have a much clearer picture by the end of June when probably more than half of the states will have voted.\n\nNEARY: And let's talk a little bit about Idaho. Now there's an election that's getting some attention belatedly, I think, and maybe for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMAHTESIAN: Well, there's one reason it's getting all this attention, and that is Wednesday's Governors' debate. It was a doozy. Two longshot, fringe candidates were included in this debate. And basically, these were two guys letting it rip, talking about Armageddon, political correctness, discrimination against motorcycle clubs.\n\nWhat's lost here is that the top candidates for governor, incumbent Governor Butch Otter and the state senator who's challenging him, are engaged in an unusually competitive race. And that took a backseat on Wednesday.\n\nNEARY: NPR political editor Charlie Mahtesian. So good to have you with us, Charlie.

    " Title: The Unconvincing Argument Against Aggregate Campaign Contribution Limits: A Closer Look at the McCutcheon Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent contention, Mr. McCutcheon and the Republican National Committee (R.N.C) argue that aggregate limits on contributions violate the First Amendment by restricting a contributor's opportunity for political expression. However, this argument appears unconvincing.\n\nTo illustrate the implausibility of Mr. McCutcheon's claim, consider his argument that aggregate contribution limits infringe upon his right to political expression by preventing him from contributing $1,776 to each of 25 candidates, along with a total of $7,500 to three others, while he could give $17.76 to every Republican Congressional candidate. This comparison is akin to developers of the One World Trade Center arguing that the First Amendment grants them the constitutional right to build to a height of 1,776 feet.\n\nThe R.N.C. claims that they are not challenging all contribution limits, only aggregate limits. However, in practice, this distinction is without a difference. If the court were to strike down aggregate limits, a contributor could donate up to the maximum amount not only to every federal candidate but also to any political action committee (PAC) that contributes to a candidate. Furthermore, as a lower federal court in McCutcheon recognized, there is no limit on how many PACs might be created that are likely to contribute to a particular candidate.\n\nIf there were 10,000 PACs, all of which were likely to contribute to John Smith for Congress, then, by Mr. McCutcheon's and the R.N.C's reasoning, you should be free to give up to the maximum of $5,000 to each PAC, for a total of $50 million. This would significantly undermine the longstanding, court-approved scheme of campaign contribution limits.\n\nAs Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote in another context, this argument is not a wolf in sheep's clothing: \"this wolf comes as a wolf.\" The only reason the Supreme Court would be tempted to let this wolf in is if the court wants to see the destruction of all limits on an individual's donations to a political candidate.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Legacy as Secretary of State: Empowering Women and Girls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her final days as Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton is stepping down from her position, leaving behind a legacy that has been marked by her focus on empowering women and girls worldwide. Clinton, who is rumored to be considering a run for the presidency, has been the first secretary of state to prioritize the impact of foreign policy on regular people, particularly women and girls.\n\nDuring her tenure, Clinton has been a strong advocate for education and inclusion in politics for women and girls. She has transformed the understanding of foreign affairs, shifting the focus from treaties and diplomatic relations to the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties.\n\nOne of Clinton's most significant accomplishments as Secretary of State was the creation of the Office of Global Women's Issues. This office has worked to highlight the plight of women around the world, particularly in emerging countries, and has fought for their education and empowerment. Rape of women has been a weapon of war for centuries, and the office has worked to hold governments accountable for systematic oppression of girls and women.\n\nClinton also included the United States in the Trafficking in Persons report, an annual review of global efforts to eliminate human trafficking, a form of modern slavery that primarily affects women and girls. She has emphasized the importance of keeping the spotlight on human trafficking, stating that it is not someone else's problem, but a problem that exists in our own communities.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, Clinton created the Office of Global Partnerships, which has focused on empowering women, children, the poor, and the helpless. Her efforts have been marked by a balance of diplomacy and empathy, as she has held her own in palaces and held the hands of hungry children in mud-hut villages.\n\nClinton's book, \"It Takes a Village,\" which focuses on the impact that those outside the family have on a child's well-being, reflects her commitment to empowering and uplifting the most vulnerable members of society. As Secretary of State, she has done all she could to ensure that our nation's impact would be for the better.\n\nAs Clinton steps down from her position, it is essential to appreciate the significant impact she has had on foreign policy and the lives of countless women and girls worldwide. Her focus on empowerment and her dedication to the plight of the powerless will undoubtedly leave a lasting legacy in the realm of foreign affairs.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Constitutionality of Voting Rights Act Section 5 in Landmark Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the United States Supreme Court has decided to take up a case that could potentially reshape the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. The case, originating from Shelby County, Alabama, questions the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires certain jurisdictions, primarily in the former Confederacy, to obtain federal approval before implementing any changes to their voting laws or districting plans.\n\nLegal experts argue that the essential question before the high court is whether Congress overstepped its bounds when it reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006, arguing that federal oversight is too broad and potentially discriminatory. Those advocating for state and local control of election affairs cite the recent presidential election as evidence that federal oversight may no longer be necessary.\n\nThe reelection of President Obama, despite losing in many of the so-called Section 5 districts and states, is cited as a reason to reconsider the need for federal oversight. However, it is in the South where the US Department of Justice has used the Voting Rights Act to challenge new voter ID laws, likening them to Jim Crow-era practices.\n\nPost-election analyses from both political spectra have highlighted the strength of the minority vote in 2012, with Blacks and Hispanics playing key roles in President Obama's reelection. Edward Blum of the Project on Fair Representation, the group behind the Shelby County case, stated, \"The America that elected and reelected Barack Obama\u2026 is far different than when the Voting Rights Act was first enacted in 1965. Congress unwisely reauthorized a bill that is stuck in a Jim Crow-era time warp.\"\n\nShelby County seeks to declare Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, citing the Justice Department's nullification of a local redistricting effort in Calera, Alabama, which allegedly played a role in the defeat of the sole black incumbent on the city council.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to review the case comes after hints earlier this year that some justices saw \"serious constitutional problems\" with the Voting Rights Act. Given these indications and other recent rulings, many legal experts believe that conservatives on the court are ready to reconsider key VRA enforcement provisions.\n\nLower federal and state courts have made a variety of rulings on new voter ID laws this year. In two cases \u2013 Pennsylvania and South Carolina \u2013 courts found the new laws constitutional but blocked their implementation due to insufficient time for adjustment before Election Day.\n\nWhile the high court upheld the Voting Rights Act in a 2009 case, conservative justices expressed concerns about the law potentially discriminating against white Southerners. Opponents of the Voting Rights Act argue that the American people have shown at the polls that the playing field is now even, and that it is no longer necessary to punish Southern jurisdictions for past sins.\n\nThose defending the need for continued federal oversight cite statistics showing that minorities are less likely to have state identification required by new voter ID laws, thus putting an undue burden on specific groups. They also point to the focus on voter fraud by Republican legislatures in the South, despite studies showing voter fraud to be rare.\n\nDoug Kendall, founder of the Constitutional Accountability Center, wrote in a Huffington Post commentary, \"The 2012 election may be over, but the fight to protect voting rights has just begun.\" However, VRA critics argue that the American people have demonstrated at the polls that the playing field is now even, and that it is no longer necessary to target jurisdictions identified as discriminatory more than 40 years ago. The Supreme Court's decision on the Shelby County case could significantly impact the future of voting rights enforcement in the United States.",
    " Title: Ahmedabad Slum-Dwellers Face Eviction Amidst Preparations for Trump's Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Indian city of Ahmedabad, slum-dwellers have reported receiving eviction notices from municipal authorities as the state prepares to host US President Donald Trump on February 24. The eviction notices come as the city gears up for an event titled \"Kem Chho Trump,\" a counterpart to the \"Howdy Modi\" extravaganza Trump organized for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Houston last September.\n\nTejabhai Meda, a 36-year-old laborer earning approximately Rs 300 ( $ 4.2 ) per day, expressed shock at the eviction notices. Meda, who has lived in the slum for 22 years, stated, \"I don't know what to do. On one side, the government is saying it is helping poor people in constructing new homes, but here we are being evicted from a piece of land.\"\n\nMeda, a father of three, added that until last month, no authorities had bothered them. He and 44 other families were asked by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to leave the plot on Monday, but the municipal body has denied issuing such notices.\n\nAMC Commissioner Vijay Nehra stated, \"The news report is incorrect and misleading. In fact, it can be called mischievous as it tries to link the issue with 'Namaste Trump' event. There are no plans for any forceful evictions in the near future.\"\n\nAn AMC official explained that the slum dwellers were \"encroaching on government land.\" Kishore Varna, an AMC official, stated, \"We have asked them before as well to clear the site, but they refused, saying we should follow due process and give them notices. And when we issued notices now, everybody is linking the issue with Trump's visit, Ahmedabad.\"\n\nMina Jadhav, general secretary of Majdur Adhikar Manch, a trade union working for unorganized workers in Gujarat, linked the eviction to Trump's visit to Ahmedabad. Jadhav stated, \"The BJP government does not want the world to see that poverty exists in Gujarat. They want Trump and others to see only the big buildings, roads, and that everyone here has toilets and homes.\"\n\nJadhav further added, \"They (the government) want to hide the poor people living in slums, that is why it has sent the eviction notices to these families and built a wall to shield Trump from noticing another slum.\"\n\nNehra, the AMC commissioner, tweeted on Sunday that more than 100,000 participants had registered to greet Trump as he heads from the airport to the city center. Trump stated last week that Modi had promised \"millions and millions\" of people would line his route.\n\nThe event provides Trump, who was impeached in December, with the opportunity to woo hundreds of thousands of Indian-American voters ahead of the US presidential election in November. Trump is also expected to visit the humble abode of India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad.\n\nAuthorities in Ahmedabad expect to spend 800 to 850 million Indian rupees (approximately $11-12 million) on preparations for the first India visit by the US president, according to Reuters, citing officials. Trump, who has made his pledge to build a wall along the US's border with Mexico a feature of his presidency, will visit India on February 24-25 to reaffirm strategic ties that have been buffeted by trade disputes.",
    " Title: Connecticut's Gun Seizure Law: Balancing Second Amendment Rights and Community Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at the Connecticut State Lottery headquarters in 1998, the state enacted a law aimed at preventing similar incidents. The law, Sec. 29-38c, allows the police to seize firearms from individuals who are believed to pose an imminent danger to themselves or others, even if no law has been broken.\n\nThe law was enacted in response to the shooting, where Matthew Beck, a co-worker, shot and killed several of his colleagues before taking his own life. Mike Lawlor, the Connecticut governor's criminal justice adviser, who was a state representative at the time, was determined to understand what led to the rampage. Lawlor discovered that Beck had previously attempted suicide and owned a number of guns.\n\nLawlor, recognizing a need for a procedure to intervene and diffuse volatile situations, worked with his colleagues to enact the law. The law allows the police to seize guns and hold them for a year, and also allows for a mental health evaluation.\n\nOne of the first individuals to have his guns seized under the law was Bernard Krzynowek. His sister, Christine, called the police during an argument, reporting that her brother was in possession of guns and \"was going to kill her and other relatives.\" The police seized 39 guns.\n\nKrzynowek, who kept the guns for sport, hunting, and protection, believes none of the seized guns presented any danger. Attorney Rachel Baird, who has represented about a dozen people who had their firearms taken under the gun seizure law, shares Krzynowek's belief. Baird says the law, as written, does a good job balancing second amendment rights with the protection of the community, but she notes that police and judges sometimes err on the side of caution.\n\nIn the first 10 years after it was enacted, more than 2,000 guns were seized. The majority of the complaints were made by spouses. Lawlor is not suggesting the law could have prevented the shootings in Newtown, but he believes it has prevented other crimes.\n\nCriminologist James Alan Fox from Northeastern University says gun laws are not a guarantee against gun violence. He suggests that we should also try to connect with people who are isolated.\n\nSince the shooting in Newtown, more people in Connecticut have been reaching out to state agencies asking for help and saying they're concerned about others who may have guns. The law, while controversial, has sparked a conversation about the balance between individual rights and community safety.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support Grows for FASTER Act, a Crucial Legislation Addressing Food Allergies in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nBipartisan support for the FASTER (Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research) Act has gained momentum in Congress, with the potential to significantly improve the lives of 32 million Americans living with food allergies. The Act, introduced by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) in April, has seen a 115 percent increase in congressional support since July, with 44 co-sponsors.\n\nThis week, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers, endorsed the FASTER Act. The caucus, co-chaired by Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), has shown resolve in supporting the Act, which aims to address the food allergy epidemic.\n\nEvery three minutes, a food allergy reaction sends an American to the emergency room. A recent study supported by Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) suggests this statistic is on the rise, with medical claims for food-allergy induced anaphylaxis increasing nearly 400 percent nationwide since 2009.\n\nThe FASTER Act seeks to combat this trend by enabling major research and data collection initiatives that pave the way for new therapies, treatments, and, eventually, a cure. FARE, the world's leading food allergy advocacy organization, has been working tirelessly over the last year and a half on legislator education, policy refinement, and advocacy.\n\nThe Act also addresses the critical issue of sesame as an allergen, with more stringent labeling and disclosure requirements. A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that more than 1.5 million Americans are allergic to sesame, a figure five times higher than the previous estimate. Despite its prevalence, sesame is not currently regulated by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), making it difficult to determine which products may contain this allergen. The FASTER Act aims to address this issue and others, making daily life safer and simpler for those with sesame allergies.\n\nLisa Gable, the Chief Executive Officer of FARE, emphasizes the importance of the FASTER Act, stating, \"FARE supports the FASTER Act because it puts into action our mission to improve the quality of life and the health of individuals with food allergies and to provide them hope through the promise of new treatments.\"\n\nWhile the growing support for this legislation is a step in the right direction, the work is not done. FARE encourages Americans to visit their website to learn more about the food allergy epidemic and to write a letter to their representative to co-sponsor the FASTER Act. The passage of the FASTER Act is not ordinary legislation; it is hope for the entire food allergy community that groundbreaking treatments are out there and, eventually, a cure.",
    " Title: The Dangers of Twitter: A Call for Journalistic Responsibility in the Digital Age\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent controversy surrounding the encounter between a group of high school students and a Native American elder, a word of advice to journalists everywhere: it's time to log off. Last Saturday night, a seemingly innocuous Washington Post news alert found its way to many phones, stating that MAGA-hat-wearing teenagers had surrounded and taunted a Native American elder. However, the story, as it turned out, was far more complex than it initially seemed.\n\nThe Washington Post's one-sided version of events, fueled by a bloodthirsty Twitter frenzy, has since unraveled. The story, complete with a short video clip and screenshot, was tailor-made for the land of the retweet. Without Twitter, this frenzied display of snap judgments and public shaming would likely have vaporized before it was even a twinkle in a writer's eye.\n\nMedia mistakes and media dishonesty are nothing new. However, this type of story, designed to confirm one side's ideological biases, was a perfect fit for the Twitter landscape. Twitter, with its instant gratification and viral potential, is a disastrous scourge, particularly unfortunate given that a large bulk of the nation's media is hopelessly addicted to it.\n\nIt is a great pixel-based den of rumors, as bleak as one of those depressing old Wilfred Owen poems about the Great War. Also, it may or may not be destroying our entire civilization from within. With this in mind, I have a suggestion: each and every responsible member of the media should immediately and dramatically declare a Twitter strike, preferably while wearing a monocle.\n\nWhile it may seem that Twitter is a necessary evil in today's fast-paced, digital world, it is essential to remember that Twitter is not a reliable source of news or information. It is a platform designed to amplify the worst in us, to incite mob action, viral groupthink, and outrage in exchange for hits of dopamine.\n\nIt is easy to get caught up in the frenzy, to let the pressure of staying relevant cloud our judgment. However, it is crucial for journalists to remain objective, to fact-check, and to avoid being swept up in the Twitter storm. After all, the truth is the only thing that can set us free.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama's Post-White House Plans and Her Unconventional Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of her tenure as First Lady, Michelle Obama is contemplating her future, aiming to redefine her role and identity beyond the White House. As she prepares to leave the political arena, she is expected to focus on writing a memoir and delivering speeches, but her approach may remain calculated and measured, similar to that of her predecessor, Laura Bush.\n\nThroughout her time in the White House, Michelle Obama has been known for her candid and unconventional approach, challenging societal norms and expectations. During her husband's presidential campaign, she openly discussed issues such as medical trials on poor black Chicagoans and the importance of women prioritizing themselves. Her frankness and honesty have been noted as one of her strengths by her colleagues and associates.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Michelle Obama made headlines for her poignant speeches, often delivering messages that resonated with women, urging them to reconcile with estranged relationships. In 2007, she spoke to a mostly female crowd in South Carolina, encouraging women to mend broken relationships and foster community.\n\nAs the Obamas' aides and friends suggest, Michelle Obama may continue to employ a calibrated tone in her post-White House endeavors. This approach, they argue, has been instrumental in preserving her popularity and authority. Michelle Obama has admired Laura Bush's restrained approach, and her aides believe that she, too, will find comfort in stepping away from the public eye.\n\nDespite the relentless attacks and insults she has faced, including a recent insinuation from a prominent Trump supporter, Michelle Obama has demonstrated a knack for conveying her viewpoint subtly, using hints, invitations, art, and even clothing. Her presence, even when she avoids controversial topics, speaks volumes, and her beliefs remain undeniably clear.\n\nAs Michelle Obama embarks on this new chapter of her life, she will be 53 years old, and her goal, according to friends and aides, is to approach her life anew. Leaving the White House could offer her a much-needed respite, as it did for Laura Bush, who, in her 2010 memoir, described the relief of being able to simply \"be\" after eight years of hypervigilance. The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Michelle Obama's influence and impact will continue to be felt, whether she chooses to speak out or not.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Temporarily Halts Same-Sex Marriage in Idaho, Allows Nevada to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy temporarily halted a federal appeals court ruling that voided same-sex marriage bans in Nevada and Idaho on Wednesday. However, hours later, Kennedy narrowed the stay to the Idaho cases, effectively allowing same-sex marriages to go forward in Nevada.\n\nActing on an emergency application from Idaho officials, Kennedy issued a one-page order Wednesday morning, staying the ruling the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals released Tuesday. Kennedy's order offered no rationale for the stay but instructed those challenging the gay-marriage bans to file a response by Thursday afternoon to Idaho's request.\n\nBefore Kennedy acted, it appeared the new 9th Circuit decision would bring the number of states recognizing same-sex marriage to 32 in short order and to 35 if the courts applied the ruling in three other 9th Circuit states that have not permitted gay marriage: Arizona, Alaska, and Montana. However, in the wake of the second order from Kennedy on Wednesday, it appeared that the tally of states allowing same-sex marriage would instead rise to 31.\n\nThe second order, which gave no rationale for the change, came after a Nevada group involved in the legal battle there, the Coalition for Protection of Marriage, filed an application asking to have the effect of the 9th Circuit's ruling in Nevada halted (or re-halted). There was no immediate action on that request.\n\nThis post has been updated with details of Kennedy's second order. Later Wednesday afternoon, a Supreme Court spokesman confirmed the filing of the new application from the Nevada same-sex marriage opponents. The Supreme Court's ultimate resolution could provide another clue about the justices' willingness to wade into the same-sex marriage issue. On Monday, the high court dismissed petitions challenging rulings voiding same-sex marriage bans in Virginia, suggesting a lack of interest in delving back into the question.",
    " Title: Christine Blasey Ford Agrees to Testify Before Senate Panel, Lawyers Say; Kavanaugh Accuser Given More Time to Consider Options\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing Supreme Court nomination process, Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her attorneys said Saturday.\n\nBipartisan negotiators have tentatively agreed to work toward a Thursday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanaugh and Ford, but talks continue on a final agreement, according to multiple congressional sources.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had given Ford a deadline of 2:30 p.m. on Saturday to decide whether she would testify before the panel next week. If she did not comply, the committee would go ahead with a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Monday.\n\nIn an email to the committee, lawyers for Ford said that while she has agreed to \"provide first-hand knowledge of Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct,\" they are disappointed \"with the leaks and bullying that have tainted the process.\"\n\nThe timing and terms of the hearing are still unclear, as negotiations continue between Ford's attorneys and the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a letter, Ford's lawyers said they were \"hopeful that we can reach agreement on details.\"\n\nThe email also indicated that Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general of the Justice Department, has joined Ford's team of lawyers. Bromwich currently represents former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year.\n\nFord alleges Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would appear before the committee next week.\n\n\"Brett Kavanaugh has been clear from the beginning\u2014he categorically and unequivocally denies this allegation and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name,\" White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \"On Monday, Brett Kavanaugh met with Committee counsels to answer questions subject to criminal penalties and offered to testify publicly Tuesday morning. Since then, we have heard about different dates, conditions, and ever-changing schedules, but today we appear no closer to a fair hearing. But one thing has remained consistent: Brett Kavanaugh remains ready, willing, and eager to testify as soon as possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, politics continue to play a role in the confirmation process. Sen. Grassley gave Ford more time to consider her options as Garrett Ventry, a communications aide on the Senate Judiciary Committee who had been helping lead the response to Ford's claim against Kavanaugh, stepped down after evidence surfaced that he was fired from a previous job partly because of sexual harassment allegations against him.\n\nVentry denied any past \"allegations of misconduct,\" according to NBC News. He told The Washington Post that he resigned \"in order to not be a distraction\" as Republicans in the Senate continue to work on getting Kavanaugh confirmed.\n\nThis abrupt resignation is one more point in the chaotic timeline of Kavanaugh's confirmation struggle.",
    " Title: Ukrainian President Zelensky Denies 'Blackmail' in Trump Call, Dismisses Implications of Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that there was \"no blackmail\" in a phone call with former U.S. President Donald Trump that is at the center of an impeachment inquiry. In a news conference in Kiev on Thursday, Mr. Zelensky said, \"This is not corruption, it was just a call.\"\n\nThe call, which prompted a whistleblower complaint and a Democratic impeachment inquiry, saw Mr. Trump asking Mr. Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden. The impeachment process, if it were to occur, would require a majority vote from both chambers of Congress, a current longshot given the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nDuring the call, Mr. Trump also reportedly asked Mr. Zelensky to look into activities involving the Bidens, referencing Joe Biden's son, Hunter, who had a lucrative board position with a Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, in 2014. As U.S. vice-president, Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine in 2016 to have a prosecutor fired, citing corruption concerns.\n\nThe whistleblower who filed a complaint over the call reportedly wrote in a memo that a White House official who listened to the phone discussion described it as \"crazy\" and \"frightening.\" On Wednesday, a poll by Fox News found that 51% of voters are in favor of impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office.\n\nIn response to the poll, Mr. Trump tweeted, \"Whoever their pollster is, they suck.\" Later on Thursday, the president is hosting his first rally since the launch of the impeachment inquiry in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where protests are expected.\n\nThe whistleblower whose complaint fueled the impeachment inquiry had a \"prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democratic contender,\" a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Thursday. The details of this working relationship or the candidate are unclear. Lawyers representing the anonymous whistleblower have stated that their client \"has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign or party.\" They also noted that, as a government employee, their client has interacted with candidates from both parties \"in their roles as elected officials - not as candidates.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's identity has remained a secret, though U.S. media have reported the individual is a CIA officer. The impeachment inquiry continues to unfold, with both sides presenting their perspectives on the events that transpired during the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.",
    " Title: NFIB Small Business Optimism Index Dips in July, Remains in Recession Territory\n\nIn its first index since the Supreme Court's Obamacare ruling in June, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index took another dip. The July index fell 0.2 points to 91.2, still holding steady in recession territory.\n\nThe index, which is compiled from the responses of 1,803 randomly sampled NFIB members, fell less than expected and hit its lowest point during the recession in July of 2009 at 86.5. The highest level the index has reached during the recession was in February 2012 at 94.5. Before the recession, the index would often average above 100.\n\nNFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg stated that Congress' failure to address the country's debt/spending cycle and fiscal cliff, as well as the lack of meaningful actions to address tax reform in Washington, adds to the certainty of sluggish growth for the remainder of 2012 and the uncertainty of what will come in 2013.\n\nDunkelberg also noted that the drop from June to July wasn't as large as originally estimated due to respondents likely having a feeling the law would be upheld ahead of the Obamacare decision.\n\nThe index found more business owners indicated business conditions to worsen for the next six months, and also believe real sales volumes will be lower in the next three months. Only five percent of business owners believe now is a good time to expand their business, a historically low number.\n\nFifty-four percent of business owners reported making capital outlays, up 2% over the past six months. Of those that made such expenditures, 38% spent on new equipment, 19% purchased vehicles, and 14% improved or expanded facilities. Those planning to make outlays over the next six months held steady at 21%.\n\nPoor sales was named the top problem for 20% of business owners surveyed. The net percent of small businesses reporting higher nominal sales over the past three months, seasonally adjusted, fell four points to -9%. This was after losing seven points in June's index.\n\nThe reported net change in job creation was -0.04%, but was better than June's rate of -0.11%. Before June and July, job creation was rising from December to May and were all either zero or positive. Seasonally adjusted, 10% of businesses added an average of 3.0 workers per firm, while 11% reduced employment by 2.3 workers per firm. The remaining 79% made no net change in employment.\n\nThe report also found 48% of business owners did attempt to hire in the last three months, and 38% found few or no qualified applicants.",

Omar's remarks, made in conjunction with fellow pro-Palestinian advocate Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), have sparked bipartisan criticism.\n\nDuring the event, Omar stated, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\" The context of her statement was Israel, marking the second incident of derogatory speech toward the Jewish state and its supporters this month.\n\nIn an attempt to defend her comments, Omar said, \"A lot of people think because I am Muslim, every comment I make about Israel is anti-Semitic.\" She further stated, \"I want to ask, 'Why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the National Rifle Association, or fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policy?'\"\n\nRep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in which Omar serves, condemned her comments, stating, \"I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy, but it's unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the US-Israel relationship.\"\n\nEngel continued, \"We all take the same oath. Worse, Rep. Omar's comments leveled that charge by invoking a vile anti-Semitic slur.\" He further asked Omar to retract her comments, apologize, and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, also condemned Omar's comments, stating, \"Lawmakers must be able to debate without prejudice or bigotry.\" Lowey went on to say, \"I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel. I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful.\"\n\nHowever, Omar defended her comments in a series of tweets, stating, \"Our democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman! I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee.\"\n\nOmar further clarified, \"I have not mischaracterized our relationship with Israel, I have questioned it and that has been clear from my end.\" She also criticized her Democratic counterparts, stating, \"My Americanness is questioned by the President and the @GOP on a daily basis, yet my colleagues remain silent.\"\n\nOmar's previous comments about US lawmakers supporting Israel because of \"the Benjamins\" from pro-Israel groups such as AIPAC also received a great deal of criticism from top Democratic leaders.",

The employee's evidence was reportedly so compelling that Lauer was fired on Tuesday night. The victim is said to have evidence of similar incidents involving other women, but no such evidence has been made public as of yet.\n\nCNN's Brian Stelter reported that The New York Times and Variety Magazine had been investigating Lauer's behavior for weeks, and in some cases, months before an employee filed a complaint against him. Stelter also stated that NBC was aware of these investigations.\n\nRamin Setoodeh, a writer for Variety, reportedly knew of \"multiple victims\" of Lauer's alleged misconduct. Tweets from Setoodeh and journalist Yashar Ali suggest that multiple women have come forward privately with allegations against Lauer, but were \"terrified\" of doing so publicly due to Lauer's power in the media.\n\nAli declined to share more details about the allegations but tweeted that Lauer is \"one of the worst\" he has encountered. Ali further claimed that Lauer manipulated women into silence, using his relationships with reporters outside NBC for this purpose. Ali described Lauer's alleged manipulation as \"evil, frightening stuff.\"\n\nThe new allegations against Lauer come as a shock to many, following his termination from NBC. The full extent of Lauer's alleged misconduct remains to be seen, as more details continue to emerge.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona's Controversial Immigration Check Provision, Strikes Down Three Other Provisions\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday issued a landmark decision on Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB 1070. The ruling upheld for now a key provision that requires police officers to check the immigration status of those they suspect may be in the country illegally during routine stops. However, the court struck down three other provisions, including a law that made it a crime for immigrants to seek employment without work permits and to not carry their immigration papers. The court also struck down a provision that allowed police to arrest anyone they suspect committed a deportable offense.\n\nThe decision, which was unanimous on the immigration checks provision but divided on the rest, has thrown into question how other states that had followed Arizona's lead on immigration enforcement will proceed. The ruling comes as the Obama administration has suspended a key enforcement program that allowed local officials to partner with federal agents in carrying out immigration law.\n\nThe court's decision prompted a range of reactions from officials in Washington and Arizona. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., described the decision as a \"bit of a mixed bag.\" Some Democrats expressed concern about the remaining provision, while others declared outright victory. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the ruling \"as strong a repudiation of the Arizona law as one could expect.\"\n\nOn the GOP side, a few lawmakers described the decision as disappointing, while keeping pressure on the Obama administration to fix the country's immigration system. Others saw a silver lining. Among them was Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who put out an optimistic statement Monday, indicating the state would move to carry out the remaining law, even without the three other planks.\n\nPresident Obama said he was \"pleased\" by the ruling. \"What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" he said. \"A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system -- it's part of the problem.\"\n\nBrewer said she expects legal challenges to the remaining provision of the law to continue. \"Our critics are already preparing new litigation tactics in response to their loss at the Supreme Court, and undoubtedly will allege inequities in the implementation of the law,\" she said. Brewer also cautioned her state's police officers against taking the policy too far, saying: \"Law enforcement will be held accountable should this statute be misused in a fashion that violates an individual's civil rights.\"\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion, which was released Monday, on behalf of the majority. Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor. On the immigration checks provision, Kennedy wrote that \"uncertainty\" over how that policy would be carried out prevented the court from assuming it would conflict with federal law. However, he offered words of warning pertaining to the rest of the law. \"Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues,\" Kennedy wrote, \"but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\" The justice also noted that \"discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns, and also involve (s) policy choices that bear on this Nation's international relations.\" He added: \"The pervasiveness of federal regulation does not diminish the importance of immigration policy to the States. Arizona bears many of the consequences of unlawful immigration.\" The Supreme Court is currently wrapping up its term, and the public is still awaiting a landmark decision on the federal health care overhaul, which is expected to be released on Thursday.",
    " Title: Ben Shapiro's Speech at UC Berkeley Held Peacefully, Nine Arrested for Disorderly Conduct\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a peaceful and orderly event, conservative commentator and editor-in-chief at the Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, delivered his speech on campus thuggery at the University of California, Berkeley, without any significant incidents. Unlike previous events, there were no fires, no rioting, and no armageddon, despite the tense atmosphere and the presence of protesters.\n\nNine individuals were arrested for various offenses, including spitting at a police officer, possessing banned items, and assault, as reported by the Berkeley Police Department. The arrests were made to maintain order and prevent violence, as masks were also banned during the event. The city of Berkeley spent $600,000 on security for the event, with hundreds of police officers deployed to ensure safety.\n\nShapiro, who is often criticized for his political views, delivered a speech that lasted several minutes, addressing white supremacy and the alt-right. He also thanked the police for their efforts in maintaining order and the university administration for allowing him to speak.\n\nDespite the tense atmosphere, many students attended the event, and some expressed their disagreement with Shapiro's views. One student even stated that she would be seeking counseling after the event.\n\nIn a tweet, Shapiro called the event a great success and thanked the Young America's Foundation for their support. He also noted that the event's peaceful outcome demonstrated the effectiveness of banning masks, a technique that was previously used to control violence from the KKK.\n\nOverall, the event at UC Berkeley was a testament to the importance of free speech and the role of law enforcement in maintaining order during contentious events. While some students were triggered by the event, the university administration and the police ensured that the event proceeded peacefully, allowing those who wanted to hear Shapiro's speech to do so.",

The Labor Department reported that employers added a record-breaking 2.5 million jobs in May, with the economy shedding a combined 22.1 million jobs in April and March.\n\nThe report, conducted in mid-May, was expected to show that unemployment would rise to 19.8 percent in May and that employers would shed 8 million jobs. If the expectation had been accurate, it would have been the worst figure since the Great Depression.\n\nStocks responded positively to the report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pointing to an open nearly 600 higher. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite also saw gains.\n\nThe jobless rate dropped from 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest level since record-keeping began in 1948. The leisure and hospitality sector, which was hit hardest by the outbreak of the virus, accounted for almost half of the increase, with more than 1.2 million employees returning to their jobs last month. In April, the industry lost a staggering 7.6 million jobs.\n\nMore than 1.3 million workers returned to food services and drinking places as states gradually allowed businesses deemed nonessential to reopen. Construction also saw a significant jump in employment last month, adding 464,000 jobs. Education and health services increased by 424,000, and retail climbed by 368,000.\n\nThe number of unemployed Americans who reported being temporarily laid off decreased by 2.7 million in May, representing the majority of the jobs that returned. Among those who said they were not temporarily laid off, the number of permanent job losses continued to increase, rising by 295,000 in May to 2.3 million.\n\nOver the course of the past few weeks, every state has started to navigate reopening their economies. However, the unemployment level, which remains at the highest level since the Depression, is expected to remain elevated as social distancing guidelines remain in place.\n\n\"It's important to remember the labor market still faces an unemployment rate at the highest level since the Great Depression with tens of millions of Americans still out of work,\" said Daniel Zhao, a Glassdoor senior economist. \"While the labor market may be on the path to recovery, there is still a long way to go until the labor market returns to pre-crisis levels and makes up for lost growth.\"",
    " Title: Nevada's Presidential Race: Rand Paul Faces Challenges as Competitors Contest Early State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Nevada, initially perceived as a stronghold for Rand Paul, has become a battleground as the crowded Republican field vies for support. The Kentucky senator, who was expected to leverage his \"libertarianish\" message and the remnants of his father's political organization, has faced challenges in Nevada.\n\nAt a recent gathering of 1,500 conservatives in Gardnerville, Nevada, it was Ted Cruz who stole the show, with Rand Paul absent due to a medical mission in Haiti. The event, the first-ever Basque Fry, drew four presidential candidates and was heavy with Nevada's political class.\n\nThe large Republican field this election cycle has provided anti-establishment and anti-Washington voters with multiple viable options, diluting Paul's appeal. Mary Burgoon, a board member of the Nevada Federation of Republican Women in Carson City, expressed this sentiment, stating, \"I don't know anybody who's going to vote for him. There are a few diehards, but that's it. Why him, when we've got so many others anyway?\"\n\nThe Pauls are no longer the \"lone voice in the wilderness\" in Nevada, according to Jericha Deaux, political director for the Clark County Republican Party. Many of Rand Paul's supporters have reportedly shifted to Donald Trump.\n\nRand Paul's departure from his father's uncompromising style has also cost him some support, though the extent remains unclear. Ray Rocha, president of the Republican Men's Club of Northern Nevada, noted, \"He's lost some of his father's people, and in my view, Cruz and Walker are taking them away from him.\"\n\nRand Paul's campaign, which is still in the process of coming together, is not concerned, according to Richard Bunce, an activist who coordinated Ron Paul's Nevada operation in previous cycles. The Paul team attributes their standing-room-only crowds to Paul's popularity, arguing that he doesn't need a high-priced team.\n\nHowever, several other presidential campaigns have already brought on staff, secured key endorsements, and started to build out field operations in Nevada. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and others have made strategic moves to gain support in the state, with Bush pointing to endorsements from Nevada's Republican Sen. Dean Heller, Rep. Mark Amodei, and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki.\n\nThe Paul campaign maintains that their grassroots approach doesn't require high-priced talent, but the fact that they are still building their team in a state that was expected to be a stronghold is telling, and their rivals have taken notice. The race in Nevada remains a dynamic and competitive landscape in the 2016 presidential election.",
    " Title: Mass Exodus of Christians in Islamic World: A Modern-Day Exodus\n\nArticle:\n\nA mass migration of Christians is currently underway across the Islamic world, with millions of Christians being displaced from one end of the region to another. This modern-day exodus is a stark reminder of the historical transformation of the Islamic world, which was predominantly Christian before the Islamic conquests.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has stated that the exodus of Christians from the region is unprecedented and is increasing year by year. The commission warns that in our lifetime alone, Christians might disappear altogether from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Egypt.\n\nReports from the Islamic world support this conclusion. Iraq, once home to at least one million Christians in 2003, now has fewer than 400,000 remaining. This decline is due to an anti-Christian campaign that began with the U.S. occupation of Iraq, which saw countless Christian churches bombed and Christians killed, including by crucifixion and beheading.\n\nThe 2010 Baghdad church attack, which resulted in nearly 60 Christian worshippers being slaughtered, is just the tip of the iceberg of a decade-long wave of violence against Christians. The same pattern has emerged in Syria, where entire regions and towns where Christians lived for centuries before Islam came into being have been emptied. The opposition targets Christians for kidnapping, plundering, and beheadings, all in compliance with mosque calls telling the populace that it's a \"sacred duty\" to drive Christians away.\n\nIn October 2012, the last Christian in the city of Homs, which had a Christian population of some 80,000 before jihadis came, was murdered. A teenage Syrian girl said, \"We left because they were trying to kill us... because we were Christians... Those who were our neighbors turned against us. At the end, when we ran away, we went through balconies. We did not even dare go out on the street in front of our house.\"\n\nIn Egypt, some 100,000 Christian Copts have fled their homeland since the \"Arab Spring.\" In September 2012, the Sinai's small Christian community was attacked and evicted by Al Qaeda-linked Muslims, according to Reuters. Before that, the Coptic Orthodox Church lamented the \"repeated incidents of displacement of Copts from their homes, whether by force or threat.\"\n\nThe exodus is not limited to the Arab world. In Mali, after an Islamic coup in 2012, as many as 200,000 Christians fled. In Bosnia, Christians are leaving en masse \"amid mounting discrimination and Islamization.\" Only 440,000 Catholics remain in the Balkan nation, half the pre-war figure.\n\nIn Ethiopia, after a Christian was accused of desecrating a Koran, thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes when \"Muslim extremists set fire to roughly 50 churches and dozens of Christian homes.\" In the Ivory Coast\u2014where Christians have been crucified\u2014Islamic rebels \"massacred hundreds and displaced tens of thousands\" of Christians.\n\nIn Libya, Islamic rebels forced several Christian religious orders, serving the sick and needy in the country since 1921, to flee. To anyone following the plight of Christians under Islamic persecution, none of this is surprising. As I document in my new book, \"Crucified Again: Exposing Islam's New War on Christians,\" all around the Islamic world\u2014in nations that do not share the same race, language, culture, or economics, in nations that share only Islam\u2014Christians are being persecuted into extinction. Such is the true face of extremist Islamic resurgence.",
    " Title: Timothy Geithner's Alleged Deception: A New Revelation in Obama Administration's Controversial Past\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has found himself at the center of a controversy, as he allegedly refused to spread a misleading message about the financial health of Social Security during his tenure under President Obama. The revelation, made in Geithner's new memoir, has sparked renewed debate about the role of truth and deception in politics.\n\nAccording to Geithner, in 2009, he was instructed by Dan Pfeiffer, then the senior adviser to Obama, to suggest that Social Security was operating in the black and not a contributing cause of the ballooning federal deficit. Geithner claims that this message was intended as a \"dog whistle to the left,\" a coded signal to the president's political base, despite the government's financial reality.\n\nThe alleged incident has raised questions about the extent to which political advisers and officials should manipulate the truth for political gain. Critics argue that such actions undermine the trust between the government and the public, potentially shattering the social contract.\n\nThis is not the first time the Obama administration has been embroiled in controversy over alleged deception. The administration has been criticized for its handling of issues such as Obamacare, NSA spying, and the Benghazi attack, with claims of misleading statements made by high-ranking officials.\n\nThe question of whether government officials can legally lie remains a complex one. While the courts have ruled that the remedy for government lying is to vote officials out of office, the discrepancy in prosecution of private individuals versus government officials for similar offenses has sparked debate.\n\nAs the nation grapples with these issues, the Geithner allegations serve as a reminder of the importance of truth and transparency in government, particularly during times of political and economic turmoil. The public's trust in government is a crucial component of a functioning democracy, and the potential for deception can have far-reaching consequences.",
    " Title: Former U.S. Attorney Compares Clinton Email Scandal to Petraeus' Federal Conviction: A Closer Look at the Facts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent comparison, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey has drawn parallels between the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State and the federal conviction of former CIA Director David Petraeus for unauthorized removal and retention of classified information. However, Mukasey, who oversaw the prosecution of Petraeus, asserts that this comparison lacks merit.\n\nThe key distinction between Clinton's email retention practices and Petraeus's handling of classified information lies in the fact that Petraeus knowingly engaged in unlawful conduct, which formed the basis of his criminal liability. The facts surrounding Petraeus' case are a matter of public record.\n\nDuring his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, Petraeus recorded handwritten notes in personal journals containing information he knew was classified at the highest levels. These journals contained top-secret and even more sensitive \"code word\" national defense information, including the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities, diplomatic discussions, and quotes and deliberative discussions from National Security Council meetings, including discussions with the president of the United States.\n\nPetraeus failed to mark these books as \"top secret\" and store them in a Secured Compartmented Information Facility. Instead, he allowed his biographer to take possession of the journals for use as source material for his biography. Importantly, Petraeus was aware of the classified contents in his journals, stating to his biographer, Paula Broadwell, on tape, \"I mean, they are highly classified, some of them. They don't have it on it, but I mean, there's code word stuff in there.\"\n\nWhen questioned by the FBI, Petraeus lied to agents in responding that he had neither improperly stored nor improperly provided classified information to his biographer. Mukasey also highlighted that the key element is that Petraeus' conduct was done \"knowingly.\" That is, when he stored his journals containing \"highly classified\" information at his home, he did so knowingly, aware that there was classified information in the journals and that they were stored improperly.\n\nIn contrast, Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly. The State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received. Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.\n\nHere, the inspector general and the Justice Department are following an established protocol when it is determined that there has been an unauthorized disclosure of classified materials\u2014in this case, potentially due to a potential after-the-fact change in classification. This protocol ensures that any classified information is properly handled going forward.\n\nWhile reasonable minds may differ about the wisdom of using a personal server to conduct the official business of the State Department, Clinton has admitted that using separate accounts would have been a better choice. However, unlike the actions and prosecution of Petraeus, there has been no evidence of criminal conduct in the Clinton email scandal.\n\nAnne M. Tompkins, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and former United States attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, has provided this opinion. Tompkins is a donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.",
    " Title: U.S. Election 2016: Economic Growth, Foreign Policy, and Trust Remain Unresolved Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 U.S. election approaches, it is crucial to understand that many of the nation's pressing issues will not be resolved on Tuesday. The economy, foreign policy, and trust in government are among the major challenges facing the country, regardless of who takes office in January.\n\nThe U.S. has been in an economic expansion for seven years, one of the longest in American history. However, the average rate of growth since 2009 has been around 2 percent, making this the weakest recovery since 1949. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have yet to articulate plans that will significantly boost economic growth.\n\nClinton's proposed tax increases and spending hikes are likely to keep the economy moving at its current pace, while Trump's plan to add five trillion dollars to the national debt could dampen growth.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, both candidates have a history of interventionism, with Clinton voting for, lobbying for, or taking credit for U.S. military interventions in the 21st century. Trump's foreign policy proposals are unclear, ranging from a potential dove to a potential provocateur. Neither candidate has articulated a plan that will stabilize the U.S. economy, reduce international terrorism, or bring order to hot spots in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Asia.\n\nTrust in major American institutions, including the media, religious organizations, labor, and business, is at or near historic lows. This is especially true for millennials, who are the most skeptical generation. The Iraq War, President Obama's health care reform, and government surveillance have all contributed to this erosion of trust.\n\nWikileaks and other leaks have exposed both candidates as untrustworthy, with Clinton being two-faced and Trump being a serial scam artist and bully. Neither candidate is likely to address the massive and ongoing evacuation of trust and confidence in government and politics.\n\nThe shift from a high-trust society to a low-trust one is particularly concerning, as people in low-trust countries tend to turn to government for protection, even if the government is untrustworthy. Until the major parties start governing in the light of day and nominate candidates who are trusted by the majority of Americans, do not expect much to change, except for things to get even nastier, at least until 2020.",
    " Title: California's Homelessness Crisis: A National Concern Amid Stagnant State Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's homelessness issue has become a significant national concern, as the state accounts for a disproportionate share of the country's homeless population. According to the latest federal data, the U.S. homeless population has increased by 2.7% to approximately 568,000 people, but California's homeless population has seen a more substantial increase of 16.4%, with over 150,000 homeless individuals.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported a nationwide increase of about 15,000 people, but California's increase alone accounts for more than the total increase in 29 states, including Washington, Hawaii, and Massachusetts. While the national homeless population remains about 10% lower than it was a decade ago, California's has expanded by more than 22% in the same timeframe.\n\nCalifornia, with less than an eighth of the U.S. population, is home to more than a quarter of the nation's homeless people and more than half of those who are unsheltered. The slowdown in population growth in California, with only a 0.35% increase over the past year, has been fueled by residents leaving the state for other regions, outnumbering those arriving from other states and countries for the first time since the beginning of the decade.\n\nHUD Secretary Ben Carson stated that \"homelessness in California is at a crisis level and needs to be addressed by local and state leaders with crisis-like urgency.\" The Trump administration has threatened a crackdown on California's homelessness issue.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom and other California officials have been criticized for their response to the homelessness crisis. The state legislature has not passed a comprehensive measure to expedite residential development since 2017 and has repeatedly shelved the most significant measure in play, SB50. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors, typifying the approach of too many local governments, voted against the measure for the third time last week.\n\nStudy after study has demonstrated the strong relationship between housing scarcity and homelessness, but the legislature's inaction remains a significant obstacle to addressing the issue. The state's response to homelessness calls for reform on the order of the right-to-shelter policy backed by the leaders of Newsom's task force on the issue, though not, so far, by Newsom himself. Anything less will enable more demagoguery and suffering.\n\nThis commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board. We invite you to express your views in a letter to the editor.

    " Title: Americans Donate Stimulus Checks to Aid Those in Need as Unemployment Soars\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans are relying on their $1,200 stimulus checks to cover basic expenses as record numbers of people file for unemployment. However, some individuals, like Brooke Young, a Salt Lake City librarian, are choosing to donate a portion of their stimulus payments to aid those in need.\n\nYoung, 39, donated $200 to a mutual aid group that buys groceries for people in need, a group that helps laid-off restaurant workers, the Salt Lake City Tribune, and the local alternative weekly newspaper. Young, who has a mortgage, car payments, and credit-card bills, said she felt guilty about her financial security while many people are struggling.\n\nIn a recent Bankrate survey, half of the respondents said the stimulus money would be \"very important\" to their near-term financial well-being, and half also said they would use the money to pay monthly bills. A separate Magnify Money survey found that 44% planned to spend the money on groceries, 42% would pay bills, and 28% would pay their rent or mortgage. Just 4.3% said they would donate the money to charity.\n\nToi Cudworth, a credit union employee in Texas, donated $950 to the San Antonio Food Bank after seeing local news reports about people lining up in cars outside a food giveaway. Cudworth, 55, also bought groceries for a young neighbor recently laid off from his retail job and plans to \"slip a few bills\" to an elderly couple down the block.\n\nIn Sacramento, Calif., Laine Himmelmann donated $100 to Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento, a nonprofit that builds and rehabs homes for low-income people. Himmelmann, 32, works at the organization as a fundraiser and plans to give another $250 when she receives her stimulus payment. The group recently laid off 27 of its 30 employees.\n\nSome nonprofits and grassroots groups are actively soliciting stimulus check donations. Cosecha, a national group that helps undocumented immigrants, got more than 1,100 people to pledge donations from their stimulus payments. Wendy Blackwell-Moore, a consultant and married mother of two in Maine, teamed up with a state legislator and a pastor to create the Pledge My Stimulus online campaign, encouraging people to donate their $1,200 stimulus payments to people in need.\n\nAdam Markowitz, a Florida tax preparer, has received inquiries from clients about the stimulus money, with some asking if they could refuse to accept it for political reasons. Markowitz noted that his clients run the political gamut in deeply divided purple Florida. Markowitz advised clients to find a way to use the stimulus money for the greater good, such as donating to charity or giving it to someone who provides a service, like a lawn care provider.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to impact the economy, many Americans are finding creative ways to use their stimulus checks to help those in need.",
    " Title: Missouri Businesses Cautiously Reopen as Governor Lifts COVID-19 Restrictions, Despite Ongoing Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the small town of Liberty, Missouri, businesses reopened their doors on Monday, following the state's largest increase in coronavirus cases and the lifting of restrictions by Governor Mike Parson. However, the response was not as enthusiastic as some might have expected, with only a handful of shops and restaurants choosing to open.\n\nTara Brendle, the owner of Brendle's Barber Shop, was one of the few who decided to reopen, despite offers of large sums of money for haircuts during the closure. Brendle expressed her concerns about the resurgence of Covid-19, but felt the need to reopen to save her business.\n\nLyle Hoover, waiting for his first haircut since the lockdown, thought it was time to return to normalcy. He questioned the severity of the pandemic, stating that he believes a significant portion of the country lives paycheck to paycheck and their livelihoods have been affected by the lockdown.\n\nGovernor Parson's \"Show Me Strong\" recovery plan, which relies on testing and protective equipment, has been met with skepticism by some business owners. Tara Brendle, for one, expressed her doubts about the state government's ability to handle the expected resurgence in cases.\n\nThe governor's actions have also raised questions about his priorities, with some interpreting his decision to tour businesses without a face mask as a political statement. Parson has also faced criticism for telling workers to return to their jobs if their employers demand it, or risk losing benefits.\n\nMayors of Missouri's two largest cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have kept restrictions in place, including the closure of restaurants for sit-down dining, gyms, and non-essential shops. Kansas City's mayor, Quinton Lucas, plans to limit restaurant seating to just 10% capacity or 10 people including employees when they reopen in the middle of the month.\n\nHammerhand Coffee, a cafe on Liberty's main square, has been open for takeaway drinks throughout the pandemic. The cafe chose not to open its doors to customers on Monday, citing county guidelines that allow for only 25% capacity, which doesn't make sense for a small business.\n\nThe uncertainty and cautious approach to reopening is reflected in the majority of businesses around the square, with florists, boutiques, and jewelers remaining closed. Hueys on the Square restaurant, which has been giving away free boxed meals to families in need, was open with some tables marked \"no seating\" to keep patrons six feet apart.\n\nThe mixed reactions to the reopening of businesses in Liberty, Missouri, highlight the ongoing challenges and uncertainties faced by businesses and individuals as the country navigates the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    " Title: Turkey Closes In on Suspect Behind New Year's Istanbul Nightclub Massacre\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the New Year's Day mass shooting at an Istanbul nightclub, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus has revealed that authorities have the fingerprints and a general description of the gunman responsible for the attack. Kurtulmus stated that investigators are close to identifying the suspect, and a massive manhunt is currently underway.\n\nThe attack, which left 39 people dead and 69 others injured, has raised concerns about the security situation in Turkey, a NATO ally that has been battling ISIS and has experienced 18 major terror attacks since 2015. The January 1st attack was the 19th such incident.\n\nThe IS-linked Aamaq News Agency claimed that the attack was carried out by a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate\" who targeted the nightclub where Christians were celebrating. The gunman reportedly sprayed bullets indiscriminately for seven minutes, killing 27 foreigners and eight Turkish citizens.\n\nOne of the victims was American citizen Jake Raak, who was shot in the hip and survived by playing dead. Raak, who is from Delaware, told NBC News that he remained silent and did not move even after being shot.\n\nRaak's mother, Grace Raak, said her son traveled to Istanbul for his birthday. She expressed her prayers for the injured and the families of those who lost loved ones.\n\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene inside the nightclub, with people falling to the ground as the terrorist reportedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and fired at will. A security camera captured bullets grazing the bar's railing and a man in red, trying desperately to escape, but being trapped as the killer approached, firing a single shot from his AK-47.\n\nISIS, which described Turkey as \"the servant of the cross,\" claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that its soldier used an automatic weapon and hand grenades in \"revenge for God's religion and in response to the orders\" of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nCol. Steve Ganyard, a former State Department official, said the nightclub is a target due to its symbol of secular decadence, making it attractive to jihadi terrorists.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the international community is closely watching Turkey's response to the attack and its efforts to combat terrorism.",
    " Title: Ninth Circuit Court Blocks Trump Administration's Title X Rule Affecting Planned Parenthood\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's Title X rule, which would have barred clinics that provide or refer for abortions from receiving federal family planning funds. The rule, known as the \"domestic gag rule,\" was first proposed last year and has been the subject of a legal battle since its inception.\n\nThe new rule, which was scheduled to take effect this May, would require providers that receive Title X funds to be both physically and financially separate from any entity that provides or refers for abortions. This means that because some Planned Parenthood health centers perform abortions, all Planned Parenthood centers would be barred from receiving Title X funding.\n\nThe move to restrict Title X funds is one of a number of actions by the Trump administration that critics say will limit access to contraception and abortion. The rule immediately faced legal challenges from Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association, the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), the American Civil Liberties Union, and a number of states.\n\nOn July 3, the Ninth Circuit issued a new injunction, this one in connection with the suit by the NFPRHA and ACLU. \"Today's ruling is an important victory in the fight against the Trump administration's attempts to upend Title X,\" said Ruth Harlow, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project. \"It allows us to go back to court to ensure that the millions of low-income people who rely on the nation's only family planning program will continue to receive vital health services\u2014and we will not give up until the rule is blocked for good.\"\n\nAbortion opponents have applauded the rule. \"We thank President Trump for taking decisive action to disentangle taxpayers from the big abortion industry led by Planned Parenthood,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement. \"Americans United for Life is pleased that HHS has taken steps to stop Title X funds from subsidizing abortion,\" said Catherine Glenn Foster, president of the group, in a statement.\n\nHowever, Planned Parenthood and other groups argue that the rule will leave many low-income patients without access to contraceptive care. Planned Parenthood also argues that the rule is illegal, since it violates laws requiring that pregnant patients receiving care through Title X get unbiased counseling about all of their options, which include abortion.\n\nIn many places, Planned Parenthood is the only option for low-income patients; a 2015 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found 103 counties where Planned Parenthood is the only provider of publicly funded contraceptives. If Planned Parenthood were locked out of Title X funds, other health centers might struggle to pick up the slack. According to another Guttmacher analysis, other providers would have to increase their caseloads by an average of 70 percent to serve all the patients currently seen by Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Title X rule is just one of several moves by the Trump administration that limit access to contraception or abortion. In 2017, for instance, the administration released interim rules allowing almost any employer to get an exemption from the Obama-era requirement that employers offer contraceptive coverage as part of employee health insurance. Those rules were finalized in 2018, one day after the midterm elections.\n\nTrump has stepped up his anti-abortion rhetoric in recent months, after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's confusing comments on a bill in his state led to a larger controversy around abortions late in pregnancy. The president's appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh has boosted his popularity among conservatives, according to Vivian Wang of the New York Times. And with a potential challenge to Roe v. Wade on the horizon, Trump may see opposition to abortion\u2014and to Planned Parenthood\u2014as a winning strategy going into 2020.",
    " Title: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Urges End to Filibuster, Calls on Democratic Presidential Candidates to Follow Suit\n\nIn a piece published in The New York Times on Monday, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called for an end to the legislative filibuster in the U.S. Senate, urging Democratic presidential candidates to support the move as well.\n\nReid, a Nevada Democrat, described the Senate as \"an unworkable legislative graveyard\" due to the increased use of the filibuster by the Republican party over the past decade. He argued that the filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold for legislation, is hindering action on critical issues such as climate change, immigration, and gun control.\n\nReid called for the Senate to abandon the filibuster \"in all its forms\" and urged Democratic presidential candidates to do the same. He argued that a Democratic president should have the ability to tackle the most important issues facing the country without the obstruction of the filibuster.\n\nReid's call to end the filibuster is not a new stance for him. In 2013, he muscled through a rules change to end the filibuster for many presidential nominees. When Republicans controlled the Senate in 2017, they changed the rules to allow for a simple majority vote on Supreme Court nominees.\n\nSome Democratic activists argue that 2020 presidential contenders cannot be serious about pushing through a sweeping agenda on issues like health care and climate change if they support maintaining the legislative filibuster. Some presidential contenders have called for the filibuster to be abolished outright, while others, such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have been more hesitant.\n\nReid's call to end the filibuster is likely to reignite the debate over the procedural rule that has long divided the Senate and stymied legislative progress. The filibuster has been used to block a wide range of legislation, from civil rights bills to gun control measures, and its elimination would require a simple majority vote in the Senate.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Qualified and Not Qualified for October and November Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has announced that the October 15 debate will take place on a single night, with 12 candidates set to participate, making it the most participants ever in a single presidential primary debate. As of October 1, the candidates who have qualified for the October debate are Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, and Marianne Williamson.\n\nTo qualify for the October debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Oct. 1, and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states. For the November debate, the qualifying criteria are even stricter, with candidates needing four surveys of 3 percent or more in national or early-state polls and contributions from 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 individual donors in at least 20 states.\n\nFive candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. The remaining candidates, including Tulsi Gabbard, Marianne Williamson, and Julian Castro, have not yet qualified for the November debate.\n\nThe qualifying criteria for the November debate make it clear that the candidate field is consolidating into three main groups: the five polling front-runners who have easily qualified, a middle tier of seven candidates who are struggling to hit more than 2 or 3 percent in the polls, and a bottom tier of candidates who have virtually no chance of qualifying.\n\nSome of the candidates in the middle tier, such as tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer, are close to qualifying, needing only one more poll. Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar still need three more qualifying surveys, but they have a month or more to rack up those polls.\n\nNeither Gabbard nor former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro have a qualifying poll yet, but they have already cleared the donor threshold, which means they are still in a better position than the six candidates who haven't met the donor requirement or registered a single qualifying poll. Given the long odds that these candidates face, we might expect some more dropouts soon. For instance, Castro recently told supporters in a fundraising email that his campaign would close up shop if he failed to make the November debate. It's easy to imagine he wouldn't be the only one.",
    " Title: The Impact of Citizens United and Its Aftermath on Campaign Finance in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe landmark Citizens United decision, a subject of much debate and controversy, has been a significant factor in the evolution of campaign finance in the United States. However, it is essential to understand that the surge of money into politics is not solely attributable to this Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe Citizens United decision, which loosened the restrictions on corporations and unions backing political candidates, has been instrumental in allowing organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to use undisclosed donations to advocate for specific candidates. Prior to the ruling, such donations could be used to influence elections under the guise of \"issue advocacy.\"\n\nThe Citizens United decision was also a factor in the 2010 Supreme Court ruling, SpeechNow.org v. FEC, which allowed individuals to pool unlimited donations in political committees that operate independently of candidates. However, wealthy individuals like Sheldon Adelson, who recently donated $10 million to a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, have enjoyed the right to spend unlimited sums on their own campaign advocacy since the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo.\n\nRobert Bauer, former White House counsel for President Obama, describes Citizens United as an \"effective rhetorical tool\" for opponents of the decision. Yet, he downplays its importance in the creation of super PACs that followed the SpeechNow.org decision. Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat active on campaign finance issues, agrees, stating that the 2010 decision \"changed the psychology\" of campaign finance to produce an \"anything-goes atmosphere.\"\n\nDespite the significant sums raised through the unregulated system, the regulated system, which drives the campaign schedules of candidates for the presidency, House, and Senate, remains the primary source of funding for major party nominees. In 2008, President Obama, who opted out of the post-Watergate public financing system, raised $745 million, compared to the $84 million allocated by the system during the general election for his opponent, John McCain.\n\nThe public financing system has been eroding due to taxpayer reluctance and candidates' increasing ability to raise large sums through the internet and other means. However, the system's collapse was not a direct result of the Citizens United decision, but rather a gradual process.\n\nThe effects of the Supreme Court's recent rulings, such as the use of corporate donations to super PACs, may become more apparent as the election approaches. So far, privately held corporations have taken advantage of this opportunity, while publicly traded companies have not. This is due to the executives' wariness of offending shareholders, a trend that may change by November.\n\nIn addition to the Citizens United decision, some critics blame President Obama for the current state of campaign finance, as he has not pushed for a change to the system. Critic Arthur Wertheimer argues that the current system will result in widespread, destructive government corruption similar to that produced by Watergate. He contends that the only test for a federal officeholder or candidate is their willingness to end this corrupt campaign finance system.",
    " Title: U.S. Government's $400 Million Payment to Iran Sparks Controversy Among Republican Lawmakers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, the U.S. government airlifted an equivalent of $400 million to Iran in January, coinciding with the release of four American prisoners by Tehran. This transaction, reported by The Wall Street Journal, was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a failed 1979 arms deal.\n\nThe cash transfer, consisting of euros, Swiss francs, and other currencies, was made due to U.S. law that prohibits transacting American dollars with Iran. While the Obama administration denies the cash transfer was linked to the release of the four Americans, Republican lawmakers view it as a \"ransom\" payment.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) stated, \"Paying ransom to kidnappers puts Americans even more at risk.\" He further criticized the Obama administration's policy, stating, \"While Americans were relieved by Iran\u2019s overdue release of illegally imprisoned American hostages, the White House\u2019s policy of appeasement has led Iran to illegally seize more American hostages.\"\n\nThe four released Americans are Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter; Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine; Christian pastor Saeed Abedini; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose case was not previously publicized.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby, in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, denied any link between the cash transfer and the release of the prisoners, stating, \"We just don\u2019t pay ransom... This was not ransom.\" He further argued that the funds, which had been frozen, were released to avoid prolonging Iran's claim.\n\nHowever, U.S. officials acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange requested the cash to demonstrate a tangible gain. The Journal also reported that President Obama did not disclose the $400 million cash payment when he announced on January 17 that the arms deal dispute had been resolved. The administration has not disclosed the details of the $1.7 billion payment, except to say it was not paid in dollars.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) criticized the transaction, stating, \"Hundreds of millions in the pockets of a terrorist regime means a more dangerous region, period.\" He further added, \"Paying ransom only puts more American lives in jeopardy.\"\n\nSince the cash was airlifted, Iran's Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada, and the U.K. in recent months.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Allows Lawsuit Alleging Trump's Emoluments Clause Violation to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump is illegally benefiting from profits made at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. can move forward. This decision marks a victory for the attorneys general of Washington D.C. and Maryland, who filed the suit in June 2017.\n\n\"We won the first round! Our case moves forward!\" tweeted Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh following the ruling.\n\nThe attorneys general argue that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from receiving benefits from foreign governments without Congress' approval. The lawsuit alleges that businesses in D.C. and Maryland are being adversely affected because organizations are choosing the Trump hotel over other area hotels to curry favor with the president.\n\nFor instance, Saudi Arabia reportedly spent thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel, located in the Old Post Office building, between October 2016 and March 2017, according to the complaint.\n\nIn February, the Trump Organization announced it had donated foreign earnings from its hotels to the Treasury Department, but the Maryland judge stated in his ruling that these calculations have not been verified or provided to the court.\n\nA similar lawsuit against Trump brought by a liberal watchdog group was dismissed by a federal judge in New York last year due to lack of standing. However, the judge in Maryland has decided that the states do have standing in this case.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the President is violating the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution by reason of his involvement with and receipt of benefits from the Trump International Hotel and its appurtenances in Washington, D.C., as well as the operations of the Trump Organization with respect to the same,\" Judge Peter Messitte ruled Wednesday.\n\nTrump was summoned in the Maryland case last week, and his lawyers now have three weeks to respond.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Maintains Fundraising Advantage Over Donald Trump in Final Stretch of Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final phase of the 2016 presidential race, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton holds a significant financial advantage over her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump. According to the latest fundraising reports, Clinton's campaign and joint accounts with the Democrats had a total of $153 million as of last week, more than double the $68 million held by Trump's campaign and partnership committees.\n\nThis financial edge allows Clinton to maintain a robust political operation, with a staff of over 800, significantly larger than Trump's team. Clinton's campaign has also spent more on advertising than Trump every week of the race.\n\nOver the course of the primary and general elections, Clinton's campaign has raised a total of $513 million, nearly double Trump's $266 million. In the first 19 days of October, Clinton's campaign raised $53 million, while Trump brought in approximately $30 million.\n\nTrump, a New York businessman who claims a net worth of $10 billion, typically contributes about $2 million per month to his campaign, but has not made such a contribution in October. The latest contribution reports, as of Wednesday, show he had given only about $33,000.\n\nThe candidates and involved groups are filing their final pre-election fundraising reports on Thursday. These reports cover the first 19 days of October.\n\nOutside groups supporting Clinton are better funded than those backing Trump. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from wealthy donors but may not coordinate with the campaigns. The pro-Clinton Priorities USA raised $18 million in the past 19 days, with significant contributions from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Susan Mandel, the wife of a hedge fund founder, who each donated $2.5 million this month.\n\nPriorities USA has primarily used its funds for TV ads, planning to spend $21 million on ads this week and next, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. On the other hand, Rebuilding America Now, one of several pro-Trump groups, raised only about $215,000 through the early part of October, and as of last week, the super PAC had about $1.2 million in cash on hand. Another pro-Trump group, Great America PAC, raised $2 million and had about the same amount left to spend.",
    " Title: Thousands of Migrants Journey North as U.S. President Threatens Border Closure\n\nA large caravan of mostly Honduran refugees, estimated to number in the thousands, has crossed into Guatemala and is believed to be heading towards the U.S. border. Hundreds of migrants have already arrived at the Guatemalan border town of Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n, along the southern border of Mexico, according to reports by James Fredrick for NPR. Organizers of the caravan anticipate thousands more to join them in the coming days before attempting to cross the Mexican border.\n\nMexico has increased security along its southern border, with only migrants possessing valid paperwork, such as a passport, being allowed to enter Mexico. However, most of the migrants in the caravan do not have such documentation.\n\n\"You can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here for the imminent arrival of this caravan,\" Frederick told NPR, standing on a bridge linking Mexico and Guatemala. The majority of those gathered were from Honduras, but there were also people from El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nJudy, a 34-year-old woman in the group who requested anonymity, stated that her home country of Honduras has become dangerous, with no safety, jobs, and hospitals lacking medicine. She attributed the deteriorating conditions to the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, claiming that basic freedoms are being oppressed in Honduras.\n\nMexico's interior ministry has requested support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as it prepares to receive potentially thousands of refugee requests in the coming days. The Mexican government has stated that migrants may apply for asylum in Mexico, but they will have to do so from a detention center. Mexico has warned that migrants caught crossing illegally will be detained and deported.\n\nWith the midterm elections in the U.S. just weeks away, President Donald Trump has kept immigration at the forefront by threatening to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico to prevent the migrants from entering. \"I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\" Trump tweeted Thursday.\n\nIn the spring, Trump threatened to cut foreign aid to Honduras and send the military to the border when an earlier caravan of Central Americans made their way through Mexico with the intention of crossing into the U.S. In the end, some of the migrants went home, and a few hundred crossed the San Ysidro port of entry, south of San Diego, and requested asylum.\n\nIt remains unclear how the president would block the current group of immigrants from crossing at a legal port of entry. Longstanding federal and international laws allow immigrants to present themselves at a border crossing and seek protection as refugees. They are referred for a \"credible fear\" of persecution or torture screening to an asylum officer, who decides if they should be deported or continue the asylum process.\n\nRecent presidents, including Trump, have deployed National Guard troops to the southwestern boundary to assist Border Patrol in catching and processing unauthorized immigrants. However, they have not blocked the ports of entry, which are under the control of agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson sent active-duty troops to the border during the Mexican Revolution, roughly 100 years ago, to stop raiders such as Pancho Villa from crossing into border states. Today, the migrants Trump wants to keep out appear to be mainly young Hondurans, including parents with small children, who are seeking asylum in the United States. Trump tweeted that there are \"MANY CRIMINALS\" in the caravan, without providing evidence.\n\nTrump has long maintained that \"catch-and-release loopholes\" in U.S. immigration laws lure immigrants from Central America. The Department of Homeland Security is compiling year-end figures for apprehensions at the southern border. DHS Spokeswoman Katie Waldman wrote in an email to NPR that the department's totals will likely show \"record numbers of families arriving illegally in the United States this year.\"\n\nWhile thousands of immigrant families are being arrested at the border every week in places like Texas' Rio Grande Valley and Nogales, Arizona, the numbers are still far below the peak in 2000, when 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants were arrested. The difference is that the big numbers 18 years ago were mainly single Mexican males who were quickly deported, whereas the current surge is primarily made up of families seeking amnesty, which allows them to remain in the U.S. for months or years while their case grinds through the backlogged immigration courts.\n\nWaldman added that the agency \"is examining all options to secure the border.\"",
    " Title: Worst Campaigns of 2014: A Review of the Most Memorable Blunders and Missteps\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2014 election has been marked by a series of high-profile campaigns that have left a lasting impression, not for their successes, but for their blunders, missteps, and scandals. This article takes a look at three of the worst campaigns of 2014: those of Bruce Braley, Eric Cantor, and Wendy Davis.\n\nBruce Braley, a Democratic congressman and Iowa Senate hopeful, has made a series of high-profile gaffes that have given Republicans ammunition to brand him as out of touch. In a radio interview last year, Braley complained about the impact the government shutdown was having on the House gym, stating, \"There's hardly anybody working down there. There's no towel service, we're doing our own laundry down there.\" In a video of him speaking to a gathering of trial lawyers in Texas, Braley described Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, whom Iowans have elected to the Senate six times, as \"a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law.\" Braley was warning the group that Grassley is poised to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Republicans win the Senate. In July, while marching in a parade, Braley was caught on video appearing to say that he's a farmer, even though there's no evidence to suggest he is. (Braley's campaign says he made the remark after mishearing what a parade-goer was asking him.) Braley has also had to deal with a series of unflattering stories detailing a nasty dispute between his wife and a neighbor whose chickens invaded the Braleys' yard.\n\nEric Cantor's blowout primary loss to an obscure college professor, Dave Brat, came as a complete shock to just about everyone. From start to finish, Cantor ran a lackadaisical, messy campaign. He ignored key conservative groups that ultimately threw their support to Brat, lost his control over the local Republican Party machinery, and spent little time campaigning in the district. Cantor, who long had his eye on the House speakership, seemed more interested in Washington than on his suburban Richmond constituents. Cantor's biggest mistake might have been running a series of hard-hitting TV ads attacking Brat by name. Brat's advisers later said the spots provided critical name ID with voters who'd never heard of him. Few tears are being shed for Cantor now: He quickly landed new digs\u2014and a multimillion-dollar salary\u2014at a Wall Street investment bank.\n\nWendy Davis, a Texas state senator, was once hailed as a high-wattage candidate capable of turning Texas blue. However, her campaign has since been marred by a series of missteps. A Dallas Morning News story in January raised questions about inconsistencies in how she recounted her life story. In March, she had a weaker-than-expected showing against an obscure and underfunded primary opponent. A month later, she was dissed by her own party's governors association. And in June, the state senator shook up her campaign. Meanwhile, in a conservative state that hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, Davis has struggled to demonstrate that she's focused on more than abortion rights. A recent New York Times poll showed Davis trailing Republican state Attorney General Greg Abbott by double digits.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2014 election has seen its fair share of memorable blunders and missteps. The campaigns of Bruce Braley, Eric Cantor, and Wendy Davis have provided a stark reminder of the importance of running a strong, well-executed campaign, even in the face of sweeping national forces.",
    " Title: Cracks in Biden's Union Support Emerge as 2020 Campaign Progresses in Pennsylvania\n\nArticle:\n\nPHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - As Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden prepares to address a \"Workers' Presidential Summit\" in Philadelphia on Tuesday, signs of discontent among union workers in his home state of Pennsylvania have emerged, potentially challenging his blue-collar appeal in a critical swing state.\n\nBiden, who launched his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh in April, has long positioned himself as a champion of unions, declaring himself a \"union man\" during his campaign kickoff. However, his stance on phasing out the fossil fuel industry, which many union workers in the region rely on for jobs, has raised concerns among some union leaders and workers.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a city that is home to Biden's campaign headquarters, the largest city in Pennsylvania, and an area with a long history of oil refineries, more than a dozen current and former union leaders and workers have questioned Biden's loyalty.\n\nRyan O' Callaghan, the former union head of a now-shuttered Philadelphia refinery, said, \"I think Biden has taken our votes for granted. Our plant closed, and we didn't hear from him.\"\n\nThe Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, closed its doors in August after a massive fire, idling more than 1,000 employees, including some 650 union workers.\n\nBiden's silence on the refinery closure, as well as that of other Democratic presidential candidates, suggests a potential disconnect between the party's aggressive environmental agenda and the need to attract union workers who rely on refineries, power plants, and pipelines.\n\nBiden's campaign did not directly respond to questions about his silence on the shuttered refinery, but noted Biden's history of supporting labor, including his role in the 2008 bailout of the auto industry and his opposition to Republican-led efforts to limit union participation. Campaign officials also referred to how Biden's clean energy plan calls for replacing oil industry jobs with well-paying, green-energy jobs.\n\nBiden has won some union backing, with the International Association of Firefighters and the United Food and Commercial Workers 1776 Keystone State endorsing him. However, most unions are unlikely to rush with an endorsement, given the large field of 2020 Democratic candidates.\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who also appeal to the blue-collar constituency with their anti-Wall Street message and opposition to trade deals, have also won union endorsements.\n\nThe signs of division among union members when it comes to Biden are evident. James Maravelias, head of Delaware's AFL-CIO, which represents some 40,000 workers and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, said, \"If Democrats think that trade union support is a slam dunk, they are sorely mistaken.\"\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic primary race heats up, the potential for a rift between Biden and union workers could prove crucial in a state that Trump won by a narrow margin in 2016.",
    " Title: The Minimal Threat of ISIS Returnees: A Closer Look at Western Foreign Fighters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing conflict in Iraq and Syria, approximately 100 Americans and over a thousand Europeans have joined the Islamic State (ISIS), raising concerns about potential threats to their Western homelands upon their return. However, the risk of these individuals orchestrating attacks in the US or Europe may be overstated.\n\nAccording to Thomas Hegghammer, director for Terrorism Research at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, the actual number of Western jihadis on the ground is lower due to many returning home. Hegghammer's research suggests that at most one in nine Western jihadis who fought in a foreign war have come home to plot attacks. This estimate, however, is based on a low-end estimate of the total number of foreign fighters, and the ratio of returnees attempting an attack in the West is likely between one in 20 and one in 100.\n\nTo date, there have been \"about four to six plots, involving five to ten people, in the West,\" Hegghammer notes. This equates to a blowback rate of one in several hundred, a vanishingly small number. The risk is particularly low for ISIS volunteers from Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe conflicts in Syria and Iraq are not yet over, and as they wind down or enter a stasis, Western volunteers may become more likely to return home and cause trouble. However, even then, they are not nearly as dangerous as one might think.\n\nWill McCants, director of the Project on US Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution, asserts that US intelligence will be able to identify and monitor returning ISIS fighters. McCants acknowledges that it's challenging to catch ISIS volunteers on their way to Syria or Iraq, but it's much easier to identify them on their way home. Once detected, their numbers are small enough that US intelligence and law enforcement will be able to keep a very close eye on them.\n\nEurope faces a greater risk due to the higher number of European fighters and the difficulty in detecting land travel. However, even in the event of a planned attack in Europe, it would be challenging for ISIS to stay off the grid, as terrorists would need to communicate with family, friends, or other militants to obtain materials, making them more vulnerable to detection.\n\nIn conclusion, while the risk of ISIS returnees plotting attacks in the West is a valid concern, the actual number of individuals posing a threat is relatively small. US intelligence agencies are well-equipped to monitor and detect returning fighters, and the challenges in staying off the grid make a large-scale attack difficult to execute. European countries, however, face a greater risk due to the higher number of European fighters and the difficulty in detecting land travel.",
    " Title: President Obama Advocates for Federal Gun Control Measures, Citing Colorado as a Model for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to regain momentum for federal gun control measures, President Barack Obama has embarked on a tour visiting states that have taken independent action on gun control legislation. On Wednesday, the president spoke in Colorado, a state that recently passed a series of bills requiring background checks for all gun purchases and limiting the size of ammunition magazines.\n\nObama's visit comes as Colorado serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. The reopening of the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, where a mass shooting occurred last summer, serves as a reminder of the tragic event that left 12 dead and nearly 60 injured during a late-night screening of a Batman movie.\n\nState Representative Rhonda Fields, who represents the Aurora neighborhood where the shooting took place, spoke about the impact of the incident. \"I could only imagine what it was like sitting in that theater, about ready to see something that you were anticipating, and then, you know, it's just a life-changing event,\" she said.\n\nFields, who lost her son to gun violence seven years earlier, became an advocate for gun control. This year, she found support in Colorado's Democratic House and Senate, which responded to the shooting with new gun control laws.\n\nObama has been counting on the public outrage generated by incidents like the Aurora shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut to advance gun control bills nationwide. \"This is our best chance in more than a decade to take common-sense steps that will save lives,\" he said at the White House last week.\n\nHowever, the president faces strong opposition from the gun lobby, as does Colorado's Democratic legislators. Dudley Brown, who runs the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, criticizes universal background checks as a step towards identifying gun owners for potential weapon seizure and calls the 15-round limit on ammunition magazines arbitrary.\n\nBrown, whose office is located near a river named for the gunpowder French trappers once stored there, warns of political payback in next year's election that could cost Colorado Democrats their majorities. \"I liken it to the proverbial hunting season,\" Brown says. \"We tell gun owners, 'There's a time to hunt deer. And the next election is the time to hunt Democrats.'\"\n\nState Representative Fields remains undeterred, stating, \"I just feel like it was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for public safety. And if I get recalled because of it, I still think that I was on the right side of history.\"\n\nFields concludes with a message for the president and Congress: \"Don't give up.\"",
    " Title: US Navy Destroyer Collides with Oil Tanker Near Singapore, Ten Sailors Missing\n\nArticle:\n\nTen US Navy sailors are missing and five have been injured after a collision between the USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker east of Singapore, according to the Navy. The incident occurred as the guided missile destroyer was preparing to stop in the port.\n\nThe collision took place at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) and occurred east of the Strait of Singapore. The USS John S. McCain, which is part of the US Navy's 7th Fleet, sustained damage to its port side. The tanker, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship, but none of its crew were injured, and there were no oil spills.\n\nThe US military, Singaporean, and Malaysian navies and coast guards are currently conducting search and rescue operations. Malaysian Navy chief Admiral Kamarulzaman sent a message to fishing vessels along the Johor and Pahang coasts to keep a lookout for missing sailors.\n\nFour of the injured sailors have non-life-threatening injuries and were medically evacuated to a Singapore hospital. The fifth person did not require further medical attention. The US Navy said significant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms.\n\nThe Alnic MC is making its way to the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. One crew member of the oil tanker told Reuters over the phone that the vessel sustained some damage to a valve. The ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore.\n\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said there is no report of oil pollution, and traffic in the Singapore Strait is unaffected. The USS John S. McCain has now arrived at Singapore's Changi naval base.\n\nThis is the second collision involving a US Navy ship in recent months and is thought to be the fourth such collision involving US warships in the past year. The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States, as it is the first day of annual drills between the US and South Korean armies.\n\nThe USS John S. McCain is named after the father and grandfather of US Senator John McCain, both of whom were admirals in the Navy. The vessel has a crew of more than 300 sailors and officers and a full displacement of 9,000 tons. In May, it successfully passed a navy inspection for mission readiness at sea. The vessel was heading from Pyeongtaek, South Korea, en route from Taiwan to Singapore.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose New Compromise to Address Obamacare Repeal and Pre-existing Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to deliver a long-awaited victory for President Trump, House Republicans are working on a new compromise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The proposal, spearheaded by Rep. Thomas MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican, aims to shift the burden of deciding what services insurers must cover to the states, while allowing insurers to charge healthy customers less, provided states establish risk pools to subsidize sicker individuals priced out of the market.\n\nThe MacArthur plan ensures that no state can waive the part of the Affordable Care Act requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions, preserving the most popular aspect of the 2010 legislation. In a statement on his Facebook page, Mr. MacArthur, chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said the amendment would make coverage of pre-existing conditions \"sacrosanct for all Americans\" and maintain the federal standard for essential health benefits.\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether the proposal can win over enough holdouts to pass, as the first attempt in March ended in failure due to a lack of votes. Republican aides have stated that lawmakers do not yet have legislative text of the proposal, leaving them unsure if it can bridge the gap.\n\nPresident Trump expressed optimism about the progress, stating that House Republicans could hold a vote on the revised plan either next week or shortly thereafter. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, signaled on Wednesday that negotiators were finalizing a plan to address the rifts within the party over health care, although lawmakers must also focus on a stopgap spending bill to keep the government funded when it returns from its two-week break.\n\nUnder the MacArthur plan, states could request a waiver from the Obamacare's \"essential health benefits\" package, which requires insurers to cover a range of services such as mental health and maternity care. They could also scrap community rating, in which insurers are required to charge the same prices to everyone in a given area. Insurers would not be allowed to discriminate based on gender or age, but older people could still be charged up to five times more than young people.\n\nStates could allow insurers to charge sicker consumers more than healthy ones, as long as they establish a \"high-risk pool\" to absorb some of the costs. This provision could win over hard-line House Freedom Caucus members, but it may deter centrists who do not want to modify the guarantees of Obamacare.\n\nWhile sicker customers could still be covered, they might face high premiums, according to health care analysts. The details of the high-risk pool, including who would be eligible and the premiums they would pay, will be crucial factors in the success of the plan.\n\nCritics argue that the plan could make coverage unaffordable for many older consumers and segregate high-cost consumers in coverage that may be inadequate unless the high-risk pools are generously funded. Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, stated, \"The Republican health care repeal bill was an unworkable, unpopular piece of garbage a month ago, and it still is today.\"\n\nThe published plan does not provide much detail on the state waiver process, but it suggests that waivers would be relatively easy to obtain. The HHS secretary is expected to approve the plan within 90 days of determining it is complete, provided the state attests that the purpose of the requested waiver is to reduce premium costs, increase the number of insured individuals, or advance another benefit to the public interest in the state, including the guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.",
    " Title: Statewide Recounts in 2016 Battlegrounds Show Little Change in Trump's Victory Margin\n\nArticle:\n\nThe statewide recounts in key 2016 battlegrounds are progressing, but they are doing little to change the math behind Donald Trump's victory. In Wisconsin, one of the three states where Green Party candidate Jill Stein has sought a fresh tabulation, the president-elect has even gained on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe push for a recount in Pennsylvania is awaiting a federal court's approval, and a similar effort in Michigan has run into new judicial turbulence. However, while Trump narrowly defeated Clinton in all three states, the numbers trickling in look unlikely to call into question the Nov. 8 results.\n\n\"In any election, the actual change in the margin of votes is very, very low,\" Drew Spencer Penrose, legal director at FairVote, told FoxNews.com. \"For people hoping for a change in results, I wouldn't hold my breath.\"\n\nHere's a rundown of what is happening in each state:\n\nIn Wisconsin, where the Election Commission has been working since last Thursday, when Stein paid $3.5 million for the recount after alleging reports of fraud, there has been little change so far to the unofficial results reported on Election Day. Trump won the state by 22,000 votes over Clinton.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump had widened his victory margin over Clinton in Wisconsin by 146 votes, with 23 of the state's 72 counties having finished their recounts as of Tuesday. In those counties, Trump gained 105 votes, and Clinton dropped 41 votes.\n\nStein, who received about 1 percent of the vote in the states under question, said her intent was not to help Clinton but to verify the accuracy of the count as she believed the votes were susceptible to computer hacking.\n\n\"We're not finding any problems with the machines,\" Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told FoxNews.com. \"The Stein campaign wanted a recount because they thought there was some problems with our machines, and that was not the case.\"\n\nWhatever Stein's reasons, it appears the recount has been more of a help than a hindrance to Trump, who saw the number of votes for him go up in several counties.\n\nIn Green Lake County, which sits about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee, the unofficial results from election night had Trump winning with 6,213 votes to Clinton's 2,701. The recount found that Trump actually received 6,216 votes while Clinton lost eight votes to finish with 2,693.\n\nAnd in those counties where Clinton picked up votes on Trump, Wisconsin officials said the number was not enough to influence the results.\n\n\"The overall results will not change,\" Magney said. \"It's two votes here, two votes there.\"\n\nThe remaining counties in the Badger State have until Dec. 12 to recount their votes in order for Wisconsin to certify its results by the following day, and ensure they count when the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19.\n\nA statewide hand recount of Michigan's roughly 2.8 million ballots that began on Monday is now up in the air as a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to stop it.\n\nThe state elections board also is meeting Wednesday, a day after the Michigan appeals court ordered it to dismiss Stein's recount petition, claiming she has no standing. The court noted that she received 1 percent of the vote and has no chance of catching Trump, who narrowly defeated Clinton in the state. A federal judge takes up the matter next.\n\nAccording to the certified results from late November, Trump won the state by about 10,700 votes \u2013 or about two-tenths of a percentage point. The recount so far was looking at eight counties, including the state's largest, Wayne.\n\nA controversy also is brewing in that county as officials said Tuesday that one-third of precincts could be disqualified from the recount because of problems with ballots.\n\nWayne County \u2013 home to Detroit \u2013 overwhelmingly voted for Clinton late last month, but officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results. During the canvass, the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.\n\nMichigan state law prohibits precincts whose poll books don't match with ballots from recounting votes.\n\nDespite the issue in Wayne County, experts say it will have little effect on the results in Michigan, or nationally.\n\n\"They are not going to affect the decision, but the discrepancy certainly warrants further investigation,\" Ned Foley, a professor of election law at Ohio State University, told FoxNews.com. \"Even if it did change the results in Michigan, it still wouldn't matter because Clinton needed to win all three states to surpass Trump in the Electoral College.\"\n\nVerification measures have been taken in the Keystone State's two largest counties \u2013 Philadelphia and Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) \u2013 but the fate of a statewide recount rests in the hands of a federal court after Stein's Green Party filed a federal lawsuit on Monday.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania has yet to certify its results from November's election, an updated count by state election officials saw Trump's lead shrink to just about 46,000 over Clinton out of the 6 million votes cast in the state.\n\nSo far, there have been very few reports of discrepancies in the recounts that have taken place.\n\nA re-examination of Allegheny County voting machine results did not change any votes, and, in Philadelphia, Clinton gained only five votes after the City Commissioner's Office recounted votes in 75 of Philadelphia's more than 1,600 voting divisions in response to the recount appeal by more than 250 Philadelphia residents.\n\nThese numbers are still shy of Pennsylvania's 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Face Backlash at California Convention as California's Liberal Policies Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the Democratic Party convention held in California over the weekend, candidates who did not align with the current progressive manifesto faced boos from the liberal audience. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper was jeered when he stated that \"socialism is not the answer.\" Similarly, former Maryland Representative John Delaney was heckled for saying that \"Medicare for all\" is \"not good policy nor is it good politics.\"\n\nThe most surprising aspect of the progressive free-for-all that took place in and around San Francisco was not the lack of tolerance or the obvious distaste for debate. Instead, it was the fact that none of the candidates addressed the elephant in the room: the state's own struggles with liberal policies.\n\nCalifornia, once known for its beautiful cities and high quality of life, is now grappling with squalid tent cities, rising crime rates, soaring cost of living, and a net exodus of residents, particularly millennials. From 2007 to 2016, California saw its population shrink by 2.5 percent, losing a net 1 million residents.\n\nA poll by Edelman Intelligence found that 53 percent of Californians are considering leaving the state, up from 49 percent the year before. Among millennials, the figure is 63 percent, a response that makes New York look downright popular. High housing costs and high taxes are significant factors driving people away. In 2018, California boasted the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S., at 12.3 percent, with an additional 1 percent for those making $1 million or more.\n\nThe majority of people moving to California are migrating from other high-tax locales like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois; they may not be aware of the state's challenges, or they may be exhibiting a form of Stockholm Syndrome. It's not just the overly taxed wealthy leaving California; families with children and people without a college degree are also departing en masse. They simply cannot make ends meet.\n\nCalifornia is ranked by CNBC as the second-most expensive state in the country, behind only Hawaii. CNBC also ranks the state 48th in cost of doing business, which may be why thousands of firms are leaving California for friendlier locales.\n\nPolicies that have led to high housing costs, such as environmental regulations that have prevented the construction of new homes, are driving people and businesses out. In 2016, McKinsey Global Institute reported that half of California households\u201450 percent\u2014cannot afford the cost of housing in their local market.\n\nPolicies that have increased the cost of gasoline are another culprit. In the lead-up to Memorial Day, as Americans planned road trips to celebrate the long weekend, Californians were paying average gas prices of $4 per gallon, more than a dollar above the national average of $2.90.\n\nCalifornia's energy costs may get even worse. The state has committed to ambitious goals of generating half of its electricity from renewables like sun and wind over the next decade, up from 16 percent today. Some experts expect the abandonment of nuclear power and fossil fuel generation facilities to lead to outages and rolling blackouts, as experienced in 2000 and 2001.\n\nCalifornia's energy costs are already the second-highest in the nation; the renewables mandate may mean residents soon pay more for gasoline, or heating oil and electricity. Real people living in California suffer the fallout from policies like those that were cheered by Democrats eager to retake the White House in 2020.\n\nThese are policies that lead to high prices for housing and energy, a laissez-faire approach to law and order that leads to tent cities and rising crime, rising spending that demands exorbitant taxes and big government programs that mean diminished personal freedoms. Voters across the nation should take note, even if the candidates themselves notice nothing.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Controversial DOJ Criminal Division Director Amidst Alfa Bank Ties\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski as the new director for the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Criminal Division on Wednesday, in a 51-48 vote that saw Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, break party ranks. The confirmation comes amidst controversy over Benczkowski's ties with Alfa Bank, a Russian bank linked to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile a private attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski represented Alfa Bank in a legal matter last year. The FBI had previously investigated the bank following its appearance in the Steele dossier, a collection of unproven allegations about President Trump. The FBI concluded there was no wrongdoing or misconduct by the bank, according to a 2017 article in The New York Times.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Benczkowski has pledged to recuse himself from any matter involving Alfa Bank during the first two years of his Justice Department tenure. However, Democrats have charged that Benczkowski's connection to the bank will undermine the investigation into Russian election interference led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAs head of the DOJ's criminal division, Benczkowski will play a role in overseeing Mueller's probe and the criminal investigation into Michael Cohen, the president's former personal lawyer. In May, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee demanded President Trump withdraw Benczkowski's nomination, citing his continued representation of Alfa Bank in April and May 2017 while under consideration for the Criminal Division role.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions praised Benczkowski's confirmation, calling him an \"outstanding lawyer\" with a \"diverse\" public service and criminal law background. \"This will be the sixth senior position Brian has held at the Department, and we are fortunate to have someone with his breadth of experience and strong leadership skills willing to serve again,\" Sessions said.",
    " Title: \"The Commission on Presidential Debates and the Controversy Surrounding Third-Party Participation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has been under scrutiny following a recent court opinion and its 2020 debate schedule announcement, leading to questions about the true nature of the organization and the political landscape in the United States.\n\nThe CPD, a private organization operating under Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations, sets standards for presidential debates that often exclude third-party candidates. This power is granted to the CPD as long as it does not directly endorse, support, or oppose a candidate, and selects at least two debate candidates.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the CPD stems from its alleged bias towards the two major political parties. Critics argue that the CPD, with officials who often hold positions in the major parties, sets \"objective\" standards that are difficult for third-party candidates to meet. This structure allows the CPD to satisfy FEC requirements while maintaining control over the debate process.\n\nThe CPD's history dates back to 1987, when it was formed by the two major political parties. Prior to the CPD, The League of Women Voters (The League) sponsored the debates. However, The League withdrew its support when it discovered the major parties had control over questioners, audience composition, and press access.\n\nThe CPD has only invited one third-party candidate to debate since its inception - Ross Perot in 1992. In the 2000 election, the CPD amended its criteria to require participants to secure at least 15% support in selected polls, a requirement rarely achieved by a third-party candidate.\n\nLegal challenges have been mounted against the CPD's criteria, alleging regulatory non-compliance and violations of First Amendment rights and anti-trust laws. However, these complaints have been dismissed by the FEC and federal courts, leaving the two major parties in control of the debates.\n\nThe activities of the CPD are seen by some as the latest in a century-long effort by the two major parties to control the political landscape. The results of this effort are evident in the high number of elected officeholders from the two major parties compared to third-party candidates.\n\nDespite this political control, a Gallup poll finds that 61% of Americans believe a third-party is needed. The two major parties, according to some, rig the system to ensure their continued dominance in U.S. politics.",
    " Title: \" Syrian Electronic Army Website Taken Offline by Internet Body Following Alleged Disruption of Major News Websites\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a countermeasure following claims of disrupting several major news websites, including The New York Times, the Syrian Electronic Army's website was taken offline by an Internet body. The hacker group, known for their cyberattacks on media outlets, had their account suspended by domain name registrar Name.com on Tuesday, according to a Tweet from the group.\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army announced the suspension of their website via a Tweet from @ Official_SEA16, stating, \"Sorry, our website will not be available for the next few hours, Name.com suspended our account.\" Name.com did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation.\n\nThe cyberattacks occurred on Tuesday, taking The New York Times' site offline and causing the company to set up alternative websites. The service was restored early Wednesday. The New York Times reported, \"Our Web site was unavailable to users in the United States for a time on Tuesday.\"\n\nThe hackers also attempted to vandalize the domain registration for Twitter.com by changing the contact email to sea @.sy, an allusion to the Syrian Electronic Army's website. It's unclear why the hackers didn't cause more damage, as reported by FoxBusiness. A spokesperson for Twitter said the site was \"looking into this.\"\n\nThe cyberattacks come at a time when the Obama administration is trying to bolster its case for possible military action against Syria. The Syrian government, led by President Bashar Assad, denies responsibility for a deadly chemical attack on civilians.\n\nBoth Twitter and The New York Times said they were resolving the attack, which actually hit an Australian company, Melbourne IT, that registered their domain names. Theo Hnarakis, chief executive of Melbourne IT, the world's sixth largest registrar of Internet domain names, said the security breach occurred at a major U.S.-based global reseller, or domain agent, where the hackers launched a \"spear phishing attack\" to steal the log-in details of the New York Times and Twitter domains.\n\nMelbourne IT declined to name the reseller, a major client. The hackers accessed sensitive information, including the user name and password for The New York Times, which led to the disruption of the site for several hours.

A Syrian Electronic Army activist confirmed to The Associated Press that the group hijacked The New York Times' and Twitter's domains by targeting Melbourne IT.\n\nThe hacker's true identity is not publicly known, but he has long used an email address linked to the group, and a second group member has vouched for his credentials.

    " Title: China's Trade Surplus with U.S. Hits Record High Amid Escalating Trade Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade surplus with the United States widened to a record in August, despite a slight slowdown in export growth, as the world's two largest economies continue to grapple with their contentious trade dispute. The politically sensitive surplus reached $31.05 billion in August, up from $28.09 billion in July, according to customs data released on Saturday.\n\nOver the first eight months of the year, China's surplus with the U.S. has increased nearly 15 percent, exacerbating tensions between the two economic powerhouses. China's annual export growth in August moderated slightly to 9.8 percent, the data showed, marking the weakest rate since March but only slightly below recent trends.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs targeting $50 billion of Chinese exports, which came into effect for their first full month in August, did not appear to significantly impact China's exports to the U.S., which still accelerated, growing 13.2 percent from a year earlier, compared to 11.2 percent in July.\n\nChina's imports from the U.S. grew only 2.7 percent in August, a slowdown from 11.1 percent in July. The world's largest trading nation started the year on a strong note, but its economic outlook is being clouded by the escalating U.S. trade dispute and cooling domestic demand.\n\nPresident Donald Trump escalated the situation on Friday, threatening to impose tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports to the U.S., potentially targeting another $267 billion of goods on top of the $200 billion in imports already slated for levies in the coming days.\n\nWashington has long criticized China's large trade surplus with the U.S. and has demanded Beijing reduce it. However, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance, with tensions remaining over limits on U.S. firms' access to Chinese markets, intellectual property protection, technology transfers, and investment.\n\nImports, a key gauge of the strength of China's domestic demand, grew 20 percent, beating forecasts. Analysts had expected growth of 18.7 percent, slowing from July's surprisingly high 27.3 percent. This resulted in China posting a smaller overall trade surplus of $27.91 billion for the month.\n\nThe surplus with the U.S. was larger than China's net surplus for the month, indicating that China would be running a deficit if trade with the world's largest economy was excluded. While no one predicted a sudden, sharp blow from U.S. tariffs, China's official export data has been surprisingly resilient so far, with growth exceeding analysts' expectations for five months in a row.\n\nChinese officials acknowledged that Chinese exporters have been rushing out shipments to beat new U.S. tariffs, buoying the headline growth readings, while some companies such as steel mills are diversifying and selling more products to other countries. Economists have noted that disruptions in supply chains are likely to be more company-specific, and will take time to be reflected in broad economic data and corporate earnings reports.\n\nHowever, anecdotal evidence of mounting trade damage on both sides of the Pacific is on the rise. Official and private manufacturing surveys for China show global demand for Chinese goods is clearly on the wane, with export orders shrinking for months in a row.\n\n\"Risks have increased due to the negative impacts of China-U.S. trade friction. The impact on exports may gradually start to show up, with future export growth possible declining,\" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.\n\nPolicymakers have shifted their focus in recent months to improving credit conditions and shoring up business confidence. Beijing is ramping up spending on infrastructure projects to spur domestic demand and the central bank is tamping down borrowing costs and leaning on commercial banks to continue lending to struggling firms hit by trade troubles.\n\nHowever, such steps will take time to arrest the economy's slide, and analysts expect the government to unveil more stimulus measures if business conditions continue to deteriorate.",
    " Title: Trump to Emphasize U.S. Sovereignty at UN General Assembly, Plans to Address Iran, North Korea, and Foreign Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to reiterate his commitment to U.S. sovereignty and emphasize his administration's drive to protect American interests. This stance has caused concern among some world leaders who value multilateralism, a system that has governed the United Nations since the end of World War Two.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley previewed Trump's address, scheduled for Tuesday, stating that the President will \"lay down a marker\" on U.S. foreign aid. Haley explained that the U.S. would be generous towards countries that share American values and work cooperatively, but would not support those perceived as counterproductive or hostile.\n\nIn the past year, the U.S. has withdrawn from several international agreements and organizations, including the Iran nuclear deal, the U.N. Human Rights Council, the Paris climate agreement, and global talks on a migration pact. The U.S. has also left the U.N. cultural agency, cut funding for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees, and sparked a trade war with China.\n\nAt a NATO summit in July, Trump threatened that the U.S. would \"go its own way\" if members did not increase their defense spending. Trump's administration is now led by hawkish advisers such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, following the departure of their predecessors Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster.\n\nWhile some leaders and diplomats have expressed concern about the future of multilateralism since Trump took office, they have been cautious about directly criticizing the President. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, when asked about Trump's impact on multilateralism, stated that trust in political establishments, among states, and in international organizations has been eroded.\n\nTrump is expected to chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on Wednesday, where he will address Iran and flaunt the latest developments in his attempt to get North Korea to denuclearize. The U.S. has its sights set on Iran, following Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement on Iran's nuclear program in May.\n\nTrump is also planning to meet privately with the leaders of South Korea, Egypt, France, Israel, Japan, and Britain. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has a close relationship with Trump, will emphasize the importance of \"collective action\" and multilateralism in his address to the United Nations shortly after Trump.\n\nNorth Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho is due to speak at the United Nations on Sept. 29. Haley stated that Ri and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had agreed to meet, but the meeting has not yet been confirmed for the sidelines of the gathering.",
    " Title: Romney Suggests Return to Pre-ACA Healthcare System, Ignoring Uninsured and Medicaid Cuts Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney hinted at his long-awaited plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), suggesting a return to the status quo ante. Romney, who has consistently promised to \"repeal and replace\" the ACA but has yet to detail his replacement plan, stated that Americans had health care before the ACA was implemented.\n\nHowever, the statement overlooks the fact that millions of Americans did not have health insurance prior to the ACA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 4 in 25 Americans, or nearly 49 million Americans, had no health insurance last year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing the ACA would deny access to insurance for about 30 million Americans who would receive coverage if the president's reforms were to remain in place.\n\nRomney also failed to acknowledge the potential impact of his budget proposal, which aims to cap federal spending at 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and boost defense spending to 4 percent of GDP. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program would face cumulative cuts of $1.5 trillion through 2022 if Medicare is subject to cuts and $1.9 trillion if Medicare is exempt. As a result, an additional 14 to 19 million people could join the ranks of the uninsured.\n\nDuring a meeting with The Dispatch, an Ohio newspaper's editorial board, Romney reiterated his belief that the pre-reform health care system was sufficient. He also downplayed the consequences of forgoing insurance, stating that people without insurance would still receive care. However, Families USA, a health care advocacy group, reported in June that 26,100 people between the ages of 25 and 64 died prematurely due to lack of health coverage in 2010.\n\nIn essence, Romney's proposed plan appears to rely on the assumption that emergency care would suffice for those without insurance, disregarding the potential consequences of cost-shifting from the patient to the general health-care market and the increased number of uninsured individuals due to Medicaid cuts. Personal-responsibility proponents may find this approach troubling, as it could lead to increased financial burden on the health-care system and potentially life-threatening consequences for those without insurance.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Outlines $2.6 Trillion Federal Spending Limit at Reagan Library\n\nArticle:\n\nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) outlined a specific budget limit for federal spending during a policy speech on Friday, setting the figure at $2.6 trillion dollars. The libertarian-conservative senator delivered the speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, a historic site associated with a Republican icon.\n\nDuring his address, Sen. Paul aimed to differentiate himself from the stereotype of being an \"all government is bad\" libertarian, an image that his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, held among some Republicans.\n\n\"I am a libertarian-conservative who spends most of my free time outdoors,\" Sen. Paul said, emphasizing his commitment to environmental preservation. \"I bike and hike and kayak. I compost, I plant trees. In fact, I have a giant Sequoia I'm trying to grow in Kentucky.\"\n\nSen. Paul argued that Republicans care about the environment and seek a balance between environmental regulations and economic growth. He also addressed the GOP's struggle with negative perceptions, stating, \"To win in California and other bluish states, Republicans will have to change current perceptions.\"\n\nThe senator's $2.6 trillion spending limit is a notable departure from the current federal budget, which exceeded $4.1 trillion in 2021. Sen. Paul's proposal would require significant reductions in federal spending across various sectors, a challenge that has been met with skepticism by many political analysts.\n\nSen. Paul's speech comes as he considers a potential 2016 presidential bid, and his stance on federal spending is likely to be a key issue in his campaign platform. The senator's call for fiscal responsibility and limited government spending may resonate with conservative voters, but it remains to be seen whether his proposals can gain traction in a political climate that often prioritizes short-term gains over long-term fiscal sustainability.",
    " Title: Trade Bill Faces Opposition Over Climate Change Concerns as Fast-Track Negotiating Powers Debate Heats Up\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement has taken a new turn, with the issue of global warming emerging as a contentious point in the negotiations. Both conservative and liberal opponents are using the hot-button issue to either support or oppose President Obama's quest for a legacy-building free trade deal.\n\nConservatives argue that Mr. Obama may use trade negotiating powers to write a binding climate deal into any agreement, which they view as a reason to deny the White House fast-track negotiating powers, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Liberal opponents, on the other hand, argue that the agreement does not provide the president enough power to work on trade matters.\n\nThe dichotomy highlights the distrust of Mr. Obama on both sides of the political spectrum and the intensity of opponents determined to scuttle the emerging deal. The issue will return to the floor of the Senate for a major filibuster showdown on Tuesday, where the president needs fast-track powers to conclude negotiations on the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal.\n\nA coalition of Republicans and Democrats will try to hold the center and rally support to pass the trade deal for Mr. Obama and for the business groups that have demanded it, saying it is critical to the U.S. positioning in the world economy to lead on free trade.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who is leading conservative opponents, expressed concerns that fast-track trade authority will be a way for Mr. Obama to impose global warming controls on the U.S. by negotiating stricter greenhouse gas emissions into a binding international agreement and circumventing Congress after lawmakers give him initial approval.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Michael B.G. Froman has insisted that the administration is not trying to deceive Congress. In a letter this month to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican, Mr. Froman ruled out a number of areas where Republicans fear circumvention, including climate change agreements.\n\nHowever, a bill Republicans are trying to pass as part of the trade package, known as the customs enforcement legislation, adds even more restrictions to the president's powers, including a specific prohibition on negotiating global warming or immigration deals as part of trade agreements.\n\nDemocratic trade opponents say their fear is just the opposite\u2014that Mr. Obama would obey customs enforcement and miss out on a good chance to force the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The trade package has been on weak legislative ground for weeks, and the fast-track bill could go straight to the president after passage, but the worker assistance would have to go back to the House, where Democrats would be faced with a final decision on whether to further embarrass their party leader.\n\nCongress is also likely to vote on beginning a conference committee to hammer out final details on the customs enforcement bill. \"With just a little more trust, a little more cooperation, and simply voting consistently, we'll get there,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.",
    " Title: President Obama Rates Affordable Care Act an \"8,\" Highlights Progress and Challenges\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, President Barack Obama gave the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) an 8 out of 10, acknowledging that while the healthcare reform has made significant strides, there is still room for improvement.\n\nThe President highlighted the progress made by the law, stating that over 16 million people have gained health insurance since its implementation in 2010. He also pointed out that the law's cost has been lower than initially projected.\n\nHowever, President Obama expressed concern over the fact that only 28 states, along with the District of Columbia, have expanded their Medicaid programs, as called for by the law. The federal government covers 100% of the expansion's cost in 2014-2016, before scaling back to 90% in 2020 and beyond.\n\nThe President attributed the lack of expansion in most states to ideological stubbornness rather than wise public health policy. He emphasized that the Medicaid expansion would not only provide healthcare to more people but also save states money in the long term.\n\nThe overall health law remains a contentious issue, with the Republican-majority Congress aiming to use a budget tool known as \"reconciliation\" to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill. If the Supreme Court rules in June that the administration is unlawfully paying out exchange subsidies to states relying on the federal HealthCare.gov portal, the law could become less attractive in those states, potentially providing the GOP with an opportunity to push their own health reforms.\n\nPresident Obama has expressed a willingness to make changes to his law, but he has stated that he is not in favor of Republican-led bills that would scrap its mandates or otherwise weaken it. The future of the Affordable Care Act remains uncertain, with ongoing debates and legal challenges shaping its trajectory.",
    " Title: U.S. Raid on Islamic State Leader's Compound Yields Valuable Intelligence and Second High-Ranking ISIS Official's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the successful U.S. military raid that resulted in the death of Islamic State (ISIS) founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, defense officials have revealed that the operation also yielded an array of valuable intelligence concerning the militant group and its top leaders. This intelligence, consisting of data-storage devices and other files, is expected to lead to future operations against ISIS.\n\nIn a related development, a senior State Department official announced on Monday that a second U.S. raid, closely following the operation against Baghdadi, resulted in the death of ISIS's top spokesman, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir. The senior State Department official described al-Muhajir as \"kind of No. 2\" in ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. raid on Saturday led to the burial of Baghdadi's remains at sea, similar to the disposition of the body of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a briefing on Monday that Baghdadi's remains were handled in an appropriate manner.\n\nGen. Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, addressing reporters at the Pentagon, said officials are working to declassify images of the Saturday raid at Baghdadi's compound and may soon release them to the public. However, many questions about the raid remain unanswered, as officials haven't provided details about the 11 children and two adults they said were taken from the Baghdadi compound, or about the three children Trump said were killed with the Islamic State leader when he fled into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide vest.\n\nOfficials haven't said how many people were believed killed in the operation, or whether any civilian casualties may have resulted. U.S. warplanes aimed guided bombs at the compound, destroying it after members of the U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force teams departed.\n\nGen. Milley and Mr. Esper were with Trump on Saturday, watching the raid as it unfolded on video taken from various angles, an experience the president likened to a movie. However, Gen. Milley said he was unable to confirm Trump's assertions that Baghdadi was crying and whimpering as he tried to flee. The video seen at the White House didn't capture the audio of Mr. Baghdadi's voice in the underground tunnel where he eventually died.\n\nA U.S. military dog assisting troops chased Baghdadi into the tunnel and was injured. Gen. Milley and Mr. Esper declined to release the dog's name, citing operational security. However, a defense official identified the dog as a Belgian malinois, a breed frequently used to support military units, and Gen. Milley said the dog was still in the region and would fully recover.\n\nTrump, on Twitter, posted a photo of the dog taken prior to the operation near Idlib.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucuses: Democratic Candidates Make Last-Minute Push as Unpredictability Looms\n\nAhead of the Iowa caucuses, Democratic presidential candidates have been campaigning intensely across the state, making final appeals to voters and expressing optimism about their chances in the upcoming contest.\n\nOn Sunday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders declared his campaign as the one \"of energy and excitement\" in Cedar Rapids, stating, \"We are in a position to win tomorrow night.\" Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emphasized his newcomer status in Coralville, saying, \"When Democrats have won the White House in the past, we have done it with someone who is new in national politics.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, highlighting his decades of Washington experience, told voters there is no time for \"on-the-job training.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged her supporters to \"fight back\" if they ever lose hope.\n\nThe Democratic race in Iowa is unusually large and complex, with four candidates fighting for victory, and others in position to pull off surprisingly strong finishes. According to polls, Biden is in a close race in Iowa with Sanders, Warren, and Buttigieg. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are also competing aggressively in the state.\n\nThe Democratic race has been marked by a palpable sense of unpredictability and anxiety as Democrats begin selecting their candidate to face President Donald Trump in November. The new caucus rules, which were mandated by the Democratic National Committee, have left the campaigns working in overdrive to set expectations before the contest.\n\nFor the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will release three sets of results: who voters align with at the start of the night, who they pick after voters supporting nonviable candidates get to make a second choice, and the number of state delegate equivalents each candidate gets. The new rules were designed to make the caucus system more transparent and to ensure that even the lowest-performing candidates get credit for all the votes they receive.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses will declare a winner based on the number of state delegates each candidate wins. The AP will also report all three results. Biden's campaign appears to be trying to lower Iowa expectations, cautioning against reading too much into Monday's results. Biden is hoping to sustain enough enthusiasm and money coming out of Iowa to make it to more diverse states where he hopes to draw strong support from black voters.\n\nSanders, Warren, and Klobuchar have been campaigning vigorously in Iowa, trying to make up ground after missing most of the last two weeks of campaigning due to the Senate impeachment trial. In a conference room in Cedar Rapids, Klobuchar appealed to caucus-goers by asking them to think about the voters who won't be caucusing, such as moderate Republicans, voters who swung from Barack Obama to Trump, and voters who stayed home in 2016.\n\nMany voters are still making last-minute moves, with 45% of all likely Democratic caucus-goers naming a first choice but saying they are open to the possibility of supporting another candidate, and another 5% not indicating a first choice. Talking to Iowa Democrats can be dizzying, with many quickly running through what they like\u2014and what worries them\u2014about the candidates in rapid fire, talking themselves in and out of their choices in a matter of minutes.",
    " Title: Ferguson Mayor Maintains No Racial Divide in City Amid Ongoing Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nFerguson Mayor James Knowles reaffirmed his stance on racial tensions in his city during a recent interview with MSNBC's Tamron Hall, asserting that the community as a whole does not perceive a racial divide.\n\nDuring the interview, Knowles, who has previously downplayed racial tensions in Ferguson's history, was asked if his opinions had changed in light of the outcry following the fatal shooting of unarmed African-American 18-year-old Michael Brown.\n\n\"I don't believe that's the case, still. There's not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson,\" the mayor said.\n\nWhen asked about the source of this perspective, Hall inquired, \"Is that your perspective, or do you believe that is the perspective of African-Americans in your community?\"\n\nKnowles responded, \"That is the perspective of all residents in our city, absolutely.\"\n\nThe mayor also stated that the violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement since Brown's death on Aug. 9 have primarily involved a minority of Ferguson's black community. \"There's 22,000 residents in our community. This has affected about a half-mile strip of street in our community,\" he said of the demonstrations. \"The rest of the African-Americans in our community are going about their daily lives, going to our businesses, walking their dogs, going to our neighborhood watch meetings.\"\n\nThough he acknowledged criticism regarding the racial composition of the Ferguson police department, Knowles also mentioned considering proposals to increase black applicant rates. However, he still maintained Ferguson as a \"model\" for Missouri.\n\nThe mayor has faced criticism about potential racial issues in his police department. More than 90 percent of the Ferguson police force is white, while blacks make up 63 percent of the city's population. According to official Ferguson police statistics, 86 percent of all stops and 92 percent of all searches in 2013 were of black people. Blacks were also arrested nearly twice as much as whites.\n\nKnowles has previously dismissed allegations that Ferguson has experienced racial tensions throughout its history as \"absolutely ridiculous.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats Begin Passing Individual Spending Bills Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to pressure congressional Republicans and the White House during the ongoing partial government shutdown, House Democrats have announced plans to start passing individual spending bills this week, starting with a bill that funds the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi revealed the strategy over the weekend, following the passage of a package of bills on Thursday that provides full-year funding for eight affected departments and extends current-year funding for homeland security until Sept. 8.\n\nPelosi stated, \"This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.\" She added, \"The certainty of the tax returns of hard-working families should no longer be held hostage to the president's reckless demands.\"\n\nThe White House has already rejected the House-passed legislation, stating it falls short on border security. However, passing the bills one-by-one will allow Democrats to highlight the potential real-world effects of the shutdown, which has now extended beyond two weeks.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said, \"Unless Congress acts, the American people will not receive their tax refunds, families will lose food stamps, homebuyers seeking mortgages will remain in limbo, and our National Parks will continue to accumulate garbage and waste.\"\n\nIn addition to the Treasury Department and IRS bill, House Democrats also plan to act on three other individual bills that cover funding for the departments of agriculture, interior, and transportation, among other programs.\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, House Republicans employed a similar strategy by rolling out smaller, piecemeal bills to re-open shuttered national parks and other programs to try to pressure the Senate, then controlled by Democrats. However, former Sen. Harry Reid, then the majority leader, wouldn't take them up, saying lawmakers shouldn't pick and choose individual departments and that the entire government should be re-opened.\n\nIn October 2013, Mr. Reid shot down a question on why Democrats wouldn't take up a bill to fund the National Institutes of Health. \"If you can help one child who has cancer, why wouldn't you do it?\" asked CNN's Dana Bash. \"Why would we want to do that?\" replied Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat. Mr. Reid later tweeted, \"Republicans are in such desperate straits that they have literally resorted to accusing me of not caring about kids with cancer. Shameful.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Delays Action on Raising Minimum Age for Gun Purchases, Supports School Security Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that he is observing court cases regarding the age limit for purchasing certain guns before taking any action, as he expressed on Monday that \"things are moving rapidly\" in this regard. The president tweeted about the 18 to 21 age limits, stating that he is \"watching court cases and rulings before acting.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) filed a federal lawsuit last Friday over gun control legislation signed by Florida Governor Rick Scott, which raises the age to buy guns in the state from 18 to 21. The White House's announcement of a series of recommendations to prevent school shootings on Sunday did not include a proposal to raise the minimum age to buy long guns.\n\nThe administration's recommendations, however, do include a full audit and review of the FBI tip line after warnings about the student who carried out the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month were not acted upon. The administration also reaffirmed Trump's support for a congressional measure, known as Fix NICS, that aims to improve efforts to enter data into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\nIn addition, the administration supports the STOP School Violence Act, which aims to improve school security and provide some funding for such efforts. Trump tweeted Monday that \"very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by the White House,\" and that \"legislation moving forward.\"\n\nThe president also expressed his support for the use of bump stocks, which will soon be banned, and for highly trained teachers to be allowed to conceal carry, subject to state law. Armed guards and increased school security were also suggested as deterrents to school shootings.\n\nTrump reiterated his opposition to schools being designated as gun-free zones, stating that such zones \"violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter.\" He argued that \"almost all school shootings are in gun-free zones,\" and that \"cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!\" The recommendations were announced nearly a month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.",

In May, during a visit to NATO's Brussels headquarters, Trump caused concern among allies by not restating U.S. support for a critical portion of the alliance's charter and instead criticized some members for insufficient defense spending.\n\nHowever, Trump has since stated his support for NATO's Article 5, which requires each member to defend each other if they come under attack. Pence emphasized this commitment during a joint news conference with the Baltic presidents, stating, \"Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense. An attack on one of us is an attack on us all.\"\n\nRussia is scheduled to hold large-scale military exercises with its ally Belarus next month. The U.S. Army's top general in Europe has expressed concerns that these Zapad war games could serve as a \"Trojan horse,\" potentially resulting in military equipment being left in Belarus. He also warned that Russia continues to \"seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe, one against another.\"\n\nIn response to the upcoming Russian-led Zapad exercise, Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite announced that NATO's air-policing missions would be doubled.\n\nPence is also scheduled to visit Montenegro, the alliance's newest member, and make a stop in Georgia, an aspiring member, which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008.

    " Title: Unscripted Speech by Clint Eastwood at the Republican National Convention Causes Stir\n\nArticle:\n\nThe unconventional and seemingly improvised speech delivered by actor Clint Eastwood at the Republican National Convention has become the talk of the town, overshadowing the usual post-convention analysis that the Romney campaign had hoped to bask in. The speech, which was described as \"strange,\" \"weird,\" and \"theater of the absurd\" by Romney's top advisers, left many puzzled and some displeased.\n\nAnn Romney, in interviews with various news outlets, tried to maintain a positive outlook, stating, \"I was thrilled for his support.\" However, Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin admitted that he \"cringed\" during Eastwood's performance.\n\nThe speech served as a reminder of the fleeting nature of a successful political moment and the potential disruptions that unpredictable turns can bring. It also raised questions about the internal workings of the Romney campaign, suggesting a slip-up in the button-down, corporate-style headquarters in Boston.\n\nUnlike other speakers, Eastwood, 82, was not subjected to rehearsals or scripted speeches, a decision that Romney advisers attributed to their trust in the actor. Eastwood, who has had political moments in his career, served as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in California and was briefly considered as George Bush's running mate in 1988.\n\nThe actor's role in the convention lineup was kept secret, with his slot listed as \"to be announced\" on the public schedule. As the last night of the convention approached, planners tried to keep a lid on the story, hoping his appearance would be a pleasant surprise rather than a cause for concern.\n\nIn the speech, Eastwood pretended to have a sarcasm-filled conversation with President Obama, seated by his side, instead of reading from a teleprompter, as he is said to despise. Eastwood's deviation from the planned script and his extended stage time caused a disruption in the schedule, delaying Mitt Romney's speech.\n\nRomney was backstage during Eastwood's remarks, according to a spokesperson, who described Eastwood's performance as \"speaking from the heart with a classic improv sketch that everyone at the convention loved.\" Rush Limbaugh called Eastwood's performance \"bold,\" but some delegates grumbled that the actor was a waste of a prime-time slot that might have been better used for other speakers or the biographical video of Mitt Romney's life.\n\nEastwood is currently traveling and unavailable for interviews, according to his manager, Leonard Hirshan. Hirshan reported a divided response to the speech, with opinions evenly split between those supportive and those critical. Eastwood's next film, \"Trouble With the Curve,\" is set for release on September 21.\n\n\"He does these things for himself,\" Hirshan said. \"It's his private life. He believes in what he's doing.\"",
    " Title: Tensions Rise as Congressman Massie Threatens to Delay Coronavirus Relief Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump expressed his displeasure with Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) for threatening to demand a recorded vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The move could potentially delay the bill's passage, leading to a flurry of last-minute travel arrangements among lawmakers.\n\nRepresentative Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) was among those affected, as he announced he would be taking a red-eye flight last night to return to Washington. In a tweet, Gallego expressed his gratitude towards Massie, stating, \"I am jumping on the red eye tonight... thanks Massie.\"\n\nRepresentative Dean Phillips (D-MN) also voiced his disapproval of Massie's actions, tweeting, \"If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~ $200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt.\"\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros (D-CA) also added his voice to the chorus, stating, \"Taking a red eye tonight,\" emphasizing the urgency of the situation.\n\nThe relief bill, Phase Three of Congress's coronavirus relief effort, passed the Senate on Thursday with a unanimous vote of 96-0. However, the bill's passage in the House is now in question due to Massie's actions. The bill, which was intended to provide targeted relief for individuals and businesses struggling financially due to the coronavirus outbreak, has been a subject of contention, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) demanding new environmental measures and millions of dollars in funding for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe House is currently in session, debating the relief bill. The outcome of the vote remains uncertain, as at least 216 members must be present for the bill to pass. The delay could potentially cause further hardship for those in need of the relief the bill aims to provide.",
    " Title: Trump Adopts More Presidential Tone in Final Republican Debate Before Crucial Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump adopted a more presidential demeanor during Thursday's debate, marking a departure from his usual bombastic style. The debate, the final one before next week's crucial round of primaries, saw Trump issuing no insults, skipping the eye-rolling, and focusing on policy, albeit in generalities.\n\nThe billionaire businessman, known for his unconventional approach, even seemed to exhibit a \"low energy\" demeanor, a term he famously used to derail Jeb Bush's campaign. The debate, the 12th of the campaign, was a marked contrast to the chaotic and memorable previous debate, where Trump's off-color discussion of body parts had dominated headlines.\n\nThe substantive and dignified performances by all four remaining candidates have helped pull the Republican brand back from the brink. Next Tuesday, the trajectory of the Republican nomination could be decided, with five states holding primaries, and in two of them - Florida and Ohio - all the delegates go to the candidate who wins the state. If Trump wins both, he has a near-lock on the nomination. If he wins one but not the other, he's still well on his way. If he somehow loses both, then it's a new ballgame.\n\nTrump, however, continued to cater to his supporters, refusing to back down when asked about his recent comment that \"Islam hates us.\" When asked if he meant all 1.6 billion Muslims, Trump responded, \"I mean a lot of them.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, in particular, was strong in his criticism of the Obama administration's opening to Cuba, a topic of interest to the Cuban-American senator and the home crowd in Miami, the heart of America's Cuban community.\n\nDespite Trump's at-times tenuous knowledge of policy, his supporters seem unfazed. When asked about the Common Core education standards, Trump responded that \"education through Washington, D.C. I do not want that.\" When it was pointed out that Common Core's standards were developed by the states, Trump responded that \"it has been taken over by the federal government.\"\n\nTrump was also called upon to explain the 45 percent tariff he has proposed on Chinese goods, a part of his larger trade plans that economists have said could lead to a global recession. Trump, however, backed down, stating that the 45 percent is a threat and not a fixed number.\n\nTrump's style, characterized by a loose language, has been a divisive factor in the campaign. However, it is a style that has worked for him both in business and, so far, as a presidential candidate. In his subdued performance on the debate stage, Trump demonstrated once again how style can often overshadow substance in the minds of many voters.",
    " Title: GOP Proposes Alternative Cuts as Congress Faces March 15 Deadline for Sequester Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avoid the impending $85 billion in spending cuts set to take effect in two days, Congress is scrambling to find a solution. However, during a brief visit to the Capitol, President Obama did not discuss the cuts with Hill leaders, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney.\n\nCongressional leaders are scheduled to meet with Obama at the White House on Friday, but expectations are low, with a senior GOP aide telling CNN that the meeting is likely to be little more than a public display of dialogue between the president and Congress as the cuts begin to take effect.\n\nSenate Republicans are pushing a proposal that would give the president flexibility to decide where the cuts would occur. Under the GOP plan, Obama would be required to submit a list of replacement cuts to Congress by March 15, and could not cut defense by more than $42.7 billion.\n\nDemocrats are concerned that this plan would let Republicans off the hook while placing the responsibility for the cuts squarely on the president's shoulders. They are advocating for replacing much of the sequester with more tax revenue from millionaires, eliminating agriculture subsidies, and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan next year.\n\nHowever, Republicans are virtually unified in opposing any new taxes, a stance that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called a deal-breaker on Tuesday.\n\nBoth Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed the other party for the current impasse during their Wednesday morning Senate floor speeches. Reid accused Republicans of being too divided to unite behind a course of action, while McConnell criticized the president for not working with the Congress he has.\n\nMeanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte accused the administration of releasing undocumented workers with criminal records due to the looming cuts. The administration, however, maintains that the decision to release certain undocumented workers was made by career ICE employees without any White House input.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out House Passage of Senate Immigration Bill, Pursues Separate Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially derail the ongoing bipartisan efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system, House Speaker John A. Boehner has declared that the House will not pass the Senate's immigration bill and will instead debate its own legislation. The Ohio Republican and his top lieutenants issued a joint statement on Thursday, aiming to assert a distinct House GOP position on the issue.\n\nThe statement, which sought to dampen the momentum behind the Senate bill, emphasized that the House remains committed to addressing the broken immigration system but will not adopt the Senate bill if it passes. Instead, the House will follow its usual legislative process, producing its own legislation through regular order.\n\nThis political maneuver by Speaker Boehner appears to be a response to the ongoing negotiations between House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, who are working towards a comprehensive immigration deal that includes legal status for undocumented immigrants and a rewrite of the legal immigration system.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat and part of the bipartisan group, expressed his belief that a bipartisan bill in the House would have the best chance of passing and producing a good immigration reform proposal when conferenced with the Senate's bipartisan bill.\n\nIn addition to encouraging the bipartisan group, Speaker Boehner has given the go-ahead for two committees to work on specific aspects of the immigration reform bill. The Homeland Security Committee has already approved a border security bill, while the Judiciary Committee is preparing to move on legislation creating an agricultural guest-worker program and another bill to establish a nationwide electronic verification system for businesses to check their workers' legal status.\n\nThe House Republican statement seems to be an attempt to shut down the possibility of the House passing the Senate bill if it emerges from the Senate. The leaders stated that enacting such a significant and complex policy as immigration reform demands a robust debate and amendment process in both chambers of Congress.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi stated on Thursday that one issue holding up the bipartisan House negotiations on immigration is the insistence on creating a nationwide electronic verification system to check workers' legal status. Pelosi expressed concern that if such a system is not effectively implemented within five years, all undocumented immigrants would revert to their current status, which she described as \"pretty drastic.\"\n\nHowever, Pelosi dismissed reports that she was insisting on broader health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, stating that she accepts the decision in the 2010 health care law that makes them ineligible.\n\nAs the immigration reform debate continues, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has signaled that he will put the immigration bill on the Senate floor next month. Key Senate Republicans have stated that they will not attempt to filibuster to block the bill from coming to the Senate floor. There is speculation that if a bill emerges from the Senate, Democrats may call on the House to pass it as well. The House Republican statement appears to be an attempt to preempt such a scenario.",
    " Title: National Republicans Worry Over Mark Sanford's Chances in South Carolina Congressional Race\n\nArticle:\n\nOperatives from both parties agree that the South Carolina's 1st Congressional District race is Mark Sanford's to lose. The Republican primary winner Tuesday night faces a real threat of handing a safe Republican seat to Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, according to national Republicans who privately concede that Sanford's baggage could lead to this outcome.\n\nThe affair that derailed Sanford's political career is just the beginning of his liabilities. Fellow GOP politicians do not like him, and he does not fare well with female voters. His campaign is largely focused on seeking forgiveness for his transgressions from four years ago, a defensive posture that makes it difficult to take the fight to Colbert Busch.\n\nThe concern among national Republicans that Colbert Busch could win the 1st Congressional District seat is so real that they are prepared to invest significant resources to help Sanford secure victory, sources told \u2588\u2588\u2588. However, Sanford's forces will struggle to outraise Colbert Busch, as her brother, Stephen Colbert, is actively fundraising for her campaign.\n\n\"This race is by no means a slam dunk for Republicans,\" said one national GOP official. \"If anyone says they know how this race is going to play out, they're kidding themselves.\"\n\nOperatives from both parties agree that the race is Sanford's to lose. The district is solid Republican territory, and Sanford, despite his flaws, is a skilled retail politician who is well-known. While Colbert Busch's campaign quickly labeled Sanford as untrustworthy and anti-woman Tuesday night, Sanford framed the general election as a clash of ideologies between a small government conservative and a pro-union liberal.\n\nHowever, polling already shows Sanford in a neck-and-neck battle, and the warning signs for Sanford\u2014who needed two elections to secure the GOP nomination despite running against a field of relative unknowns\u2014cannot be ignored:\n\n\u2022 Not a single member of the South Carolina congressional delegation has endorsed Sanford, an indication of his weak standing among his would-be Washington colleagues. Two House Republicans backed one of Sanford's GOP primary rivals. GOP leaders are grappling with how to get the delegation on board now that he has defeated former Charleston County Councilman Curtis Bostic in the runoff.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to popular Sen. Tim Scott, whose appointment to the Senate triggered the race for his House seat. Scott has stayed out of the race, but national Republicans will want him to endorse Sanford. In 2009, though, Scott, then a state representative, signed a letter calling on Sanford to resign. The ex-governor opted to serve out his term.\n\nSanford's actions, according to the letter, \"reveal a pattern of poor decision making and questionable leadership.\" The letter concluded that \"unless major changes are made, South Carolina will find itself perpetually sidetracked by the disarray that you have brought upon our state.\"",
    " Title: Controversial Remarks by Virginia Lieutenant Governor Nominee E.W. Jackson Spark Political Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Republican Party of Virginia Convention, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor, E.W. Jackson, has come under fire for controversial remarks he made in a YouTube video last year. The pastor and attorney from Chesapeake compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and criticized African-Americans for their \"slavish devotion\" to the Democratic Party.\n\nIn the video, Jackson stated, \"The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions. Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was.\"\n\nDemocrats have seized upon these remarks and others in an attempt to tie Jackson to the rest of the Republican ticket, particularly conservative gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. The November election will see Cuccinelli face Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman.\n\nBrennan Bilberry, McAuliffe's campaign spokesman, said in a statement, \"Extremely divisive rhetoric from Jackson and Cuccinelli reflects the social agenda they would impose on Virginia. At a time when Virginians are looking for leaders who focus on jobs, the Tea Party has nominated a ticket whose careers have been defined by a radical social agenda.\"\n\nCuccinelli and Jackson were nominated at Saturday's GOP convention in Richmond, where Jackson beat out six other candidates for the number two spot on the ticket. Party activists also tapped Mark Obenshain to be their nominee for attorney general.\n\nJackson, the founder of a nondenominational church, is a former Marine and graduate of Harvard Law School. However, he is rapidly gaining notoriety for a series of controversial statements that have surfaced online following his surprise victory on Saturday. He has publicly questioned President Barack Obama's faith and has been spearheading efforts to recruit black Democrats to the GOP since last year, when he unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Virginia.\n\nIn the same video, Jackson said, \"Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder. We belong to God.\" He also stated, \"Our ancestors were sold against their will centuries ago, but we're going through the slave market voluntarily today.\"\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Jackson would hold the tie-breaking vote in the currently evenly divided state Senate. Republicans currently hold the lieutenant governorship and control of the 40-seat body. However, with the unpolished Jackson as the GOP nominee, Democrats are now a safe bet to pick up the lieutenant governor's office and control of the senate.\n\nDemocrats will decide their nominee in a June 11 primary. The decision to nominate candidates at a convention instead of a primary gave a relatively small group of conservative activists control over the nomination process, causing frustration among establishment Republicans.\n\nVirginia, a purple state, currently has a Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, but voted for Obama in the last two presidential elections. Poll numbers so far show neither party with a significant lead in the race, less than six months before Election Day. Because Virginia voters elect the governor and lieutenant governor separately, it's possible that the winners could be from different parties.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Tone Emerges in Congress After Shooting, Yet Doubts Persist on Gun Control Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting incident at a Virginia park baseball diamond that left several congressional members injured, a shift in tone has been observed in the ongoing gun control debate on Capitol Hill. Unlike past tragedies, the focus has been on unity and sensitivity rather than heated debates over gun control policies.\n\nFollowing the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, there was a push for stricter background checks and limits on ammunition. After the shooting at Orlando's LGBT Pulse Nightclub in 2016, Democrats demanded a vote on purchasing access for people on the no-fly and terror watch lists. However, this time around, the tone has been different.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws, expressed concern about the country's quick return to normalcy following such catastrophic events. He wrote on his Facebook page, \"Are we so jaundiced to gun violence and mass shootings that it only takes us twenty-four hours now to revert back to business as usual?\"\n\nHours after the shooting, Murphy sounded disheartened and hopeless about the prospect of stricter gun regulations being addressed in Washington. He told Politico, \"We're beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings. I mean, we don't. We don't.\"\n\nFormer New York congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, who lost her husband in a 1993 shooting rampage, expressed her dismay during an interview on Thursday. She argued that the lack of action between mass shootings is a shame. McCarthy's husband was fatally shot during a shooting rampage on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train outside New York City.\n\nThe idea that talking about policies after a shooting is seen as politicizing a tragedy still makes McCarthy defensive. \"We can't talk about it any other time. Nobody listens to us. It just dies,\" she said. \"When was the last time you heard about anyone trying to do anything when there isn't a mass shooting of any sort? The subject just won't come up.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have been discussing possible policy solutions. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), who was at the practice during the shooting, suggested that more people on the scene should have had guns to shoot back at the assailant. Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) spoke about a bill he introduced in March that would make it easier for people to carry a gun and \"allow the most law-abiding among us to defend themselves.\"\n\nMcCarthy, while glad for the bipartisan tone and the calming of political rhetoric, sounded disappointed watching the coverage of Capitol Hill. \"Towards the end of my career, I thought, 'Could we stop praying for everybody who gets shot or injured and just do something about it?' That is how frustrated you get, and I know most victims feel the same way,\" she said.",
    " Title: Rep. Chris Collins Suspends Re-election Bid Amid Insider Trading Charges, Remains on Ballot for November Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from western New York, has suspended his re-election bid in the wake of insider trading charges. The move comes as Democrats are reportedly eyeing the district to potentially flip in the upcoming November elections.\n\nCollins, who has held the upstate New York seat since 2012, announced his decision on Twitter, stating that Democrats are \"laser focused\" on taking back the House and launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. He emphasized that his suspension of the campaign effectively removes his name from the ballot in New York's 27th Congressional District, as per New York state law.\n\nUnder the state law, a candidate's name cannot be replaced on a ballot this close to the election unless they die, move out of the state, or are nominated for another office. Collins, who was the first member of the House to back Trump in the 2016 election and seconded his presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, said he will \"fill out the remaining few months\" of his term to support Trump's agenda.\n\nBill Reilich, chairman of the Monroe County GOP, confirmed that county leaders in the district are evaluating \"several highly qualified individuals\" as potential replacement candidates. To comply with state law to remove Collins from the ballot, he could be nominated to a town clerk position in his district, which wouldn't necessarily require him to live within the town. He would likely be nominated on a third-party line to reduce his chances of winning a position he doesn't want to hold.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized Collins' announcement as \"insufficient and overdue\" and called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to demand his resignation. \"No person is above the law, not the President or his first supporter in Congress,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nCollins was arrested Wednesday morning after a federal grand jury indicted him on insider trading charges, as well as lying to federal agents. In his statement, Collins said he would \"continue to fight the meritless charges\" and looks forward to clearing his name of wrongdoing.\n\nThe federal indictment charges Collins, his son Cameron, and Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron's fianc\u00e9e, with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and seven counts of securities fraud. Rep. Collins is also charged with making false statements to the FBI.\n\nCollins is accused of receiving inside information about negative clinical trial tests conducted by Innate Immunotherapeutics, an Australian biotech company with which he has long been associated. He then is accused of passing that information on to his son, prompting the son and others to sell 1.78 million Innate shares shortly before the bad news was made public in June 2017, and the share price plummeted. Those others included Cameron Collins' fianc\u00e9e, Lauren Zarsky, her mother, Dorothy, and other friends and family members. They avoided losses of $768,600, according to the complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThis development marks a significant political shift in New York's 27th Congressional District, with the race now likely to be contested by new candidates. The outcome of the investigation and the November election will determine the future representation of the district in Congress.",
    " Title: \"Shift in Senate Race Odds: Democrats Gain Advantage in Key States, According to Nate Silver's Analysis\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Republican Party's prospects of capturing the Senate have taken a hit, as the fortunes of Democrats in crucial states have seen a surge, according to Nate Silver, the former New York Times statistician and founder of FiveThirtyEight.com. The latest analysis by Silver indicates that the Republican odds now stand at 55 percent, a drop from 64 percent just two weeks ago.\n\nSilver's intricate statistical model suggests that the Democrats now have a stronger likelihood of winning, primarily due to shifts in the Senate races in Colorado and North Carolina. These states, which were previously leaning towards the Republicans, now provide an advantage to the Democrats. Silver classifies these two states as \"highly competitive purple states,\" alongside Iowa, Michigan, and New Hampshire. All five seats are currently held by Democrats, with the exception of New Hampshire.\n\nSilver attributes the Democrat surge in these purple states to recent polls showing a surge for North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall. He finds it perplexing that this Democrat surge has occurred at a time when Democrats' position on the generic congressional ballot\u2014often considered the best indicator of the nation's mood\u2014has weakened.\n\nSilver also notes that unlike the most recent figures, average historical data from the generic ballot tends to directly correlate with the performance of candidates in state-by-state Senate polls. He suggests that the influence of money in these races could be one explanation, citing massive financial advantages for the Democrats in North Carolina and Colorado, along with higher outside spending by Democratic-leaning super PACs.\n\nIn conclusion, Silver's analysis indicates that the GOP's path to a Senate majority is less robust than before, although the race remains close. The 55-45 edge in favor of the Republicans may not be enough to sway a sports bettor or poker player, but it is a significant shift in the political landscape of the upcoming Senate elections.",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation Announces New Donation Policy Amidst Ongoing Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Clinton Foundation has announced that, should Hillary Clinton be elected as President, the foundation will no longer accept foreign and corporate donations, a move that comes in the wake of reports suggesting the foundation may have been hacked. This new pledge, while a tacit admission of wrongdoing, has been met with skepticism as it raises questions about the foundation's past practices, particularly during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation's decision to forgo foreign and corporate donations, a practice at the heart of the Clinton Cash scandal, is being viewed as a response to the potential exposure of internal communications due to the alleged hack. However, critics question why such a move was not implemented during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, given the potential for influence peddling and pay-to-play schemes.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation has yet to disclose 1,100 foreign donations, a fact reported by numerous mainstream media organizations. The Clinton Cash documentary has also revealed hidden foreign donations, including four totaling $ 2.35 million from Ian Telfer, the former head of one of the Russian government's uranium companies.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about the Clinton Foundation's approval of the transfer of 20% of all U.S. uranium to Russia, while not disclosing that nine investors in that uranium deal funneled $ 145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Other questions remain unanswered, such as why Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, sat on the board of a company that received a rare \"gold exploitation permit\" from the Haitian government while she was dispersing billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in Haiti earthquake disaster relief.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has launched a probe to investigate why the Obama Department of Justice blocked multiple FBI field office requests to investigate the Clinton Foundation. However, broader questions about the Clinton Foundation's relationships with foreign entities and potential conflicts of interest remain unanswered.\n\nAs the election approaches, the American public awaits answers from Hillary Clinton regarding these and other questions related to the Clinton Foundation's foreign donations and potential conflicts of interest. The mainstream media's role in investigative reporting and demanding serious answers will be crucial in ensuring transparency and accountability.",

The U.S. embassy in Manila and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe move comes after the U.S. Congress approved a 2020 budget that contains a provision introduced by the senators against anyone involved in holding de Lima, who was charged with drug offenses in 2017 after she led an investigation into mass killings during Duterte's war on drugs.\n\n\"We will not sit idly if they continue to interfere with our processes as a sovereign state,\" Philippine presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told a news conference.\n\nSenator de Lima, a justice minister in a former administration, has won numerous awards from human rights groups, who consider her a prisoner of conscience. She has called for an international investigation into Duterte's war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed. Police say those killed were drug dealers who resisted arrest, but activists say many of the killings were murders.\n\nDavid Carle, spokesman for Senator Leahy, called the charges against de Lima politically motivated, and added: \"This is about the right of Filipino citizens - and people everywhere - to freely express their opinions, including opinions that may be critical of government policies that involve the use of excessive force and the denial of due process.\"\n\nPanelo said travel restrictions over de Lima's detention were nonsense because she was not wrongfully imprisoned but detained pending trial for crimes. \"The case of Senator de Lima is not one of persecution but of prosecution,\" he said.\n\nDuterte makes no secret of his disdain for the United States and what he considers its hypocrisy and interference, though he admits that most Filipinos and his military have high regard for their country's former colonial ruler. The United States is the Philippines' biggest defense ally, and millions of Filipinos have relatives who are U.S. citizens.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Post-Denver Debate Challenge: Six Keys to a Revival\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's electrifying performance in the first presidential debate has left many questioning if it was a one-time fluke or a sign of a more substantial shift in the race. To ensure the latter, Romney must demonstrate that his Denver debate victory was a reflection of his true abilities and not a mere aberration.\n\nHere are six key elements that could contribute to a potential Romney upset:\n\n1. Consistency: Romney must maintain the sharp, coherent, and engaging style he displayed in Denver. He needs to prove that his improved performance was not a fluke but a reflection of his true character.\n\n2. Contrasting Obama: The president is expected to improve in the next debate, making it crucial for Romney to present a strong but not necessarily superior performance. A clear contrast between the two candidates could help Romney maintain his momentum.\n\n3. Emotional Connection: Romney has been showcasing a more emotive and connected side of himself at rallies since the debate. This not only provides him with practice for the town hall-style format but also allows him to connect with voters on a deeper level.\n\n4. Policy Proposals: Romney must continue to present clear, compelling, and feasible policy proposals. He needs to demonstrate that he is not only a credible alternative to Obama but also a leader with a vision for the future.\n\n5. Campaign Strategy: Romney's campaign strategy must be tight and effective. He needs to capitalize on the momentum from the debate and use it to his advantage in the remaining debates and campaign events.\n\n6. Voter Turnout: Ultimately, the success of Romney's campaign will depend on voter turnout. He needs to inspire and energize his base while also appealing to undecided voters. A strong showing in the debates and a clear contrast with Obama could help drive voter turnout in Romney's favor.\n\nWhile a clear Obama victory is unlikely, a clear Romney loss could invite perceptions of a downward spiral in the incumbent's strength and significantly increase the odds of a Romney presidency. The next few weeks will be crucial for both candidates, and the race remains wide open.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Significant Overhaul of U.S. Immigration System, Prioritizing Merit-Based Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a major policy announcement on Wednesday, President Donald Trump unveiled plans for new immigration laws that aim to reduce the total number of immigrants admitted to the United States by half over a decade and prioritize those who can speak English or are well-educated. The proposed legislation, known as the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, also caps the number of refugees admitted annually at 50,000 and eliminates the diversity visa lottery, which currently allocates 50,000 visas a year to residents of countries that do not currently send significant numbers of migrants to the U.S.\n\nThe RAISE Act, introduced at the White House, is expected to reduce the number of immigrants admitted to the U.S. by 41% in its first year and by 50% over a 10-year period, according to an estimate provided by the office of one of the bill's sponsors, Republican Senator Tom Cotton. The bill was presented alongside Cotton and another co-sponsor, Republican Senator David Perdue, who described it as \"legislation that would represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half century.\"\n\nTrump has long been vocal about illegal immigration, making a border wall with Mexico his signature campaign policy. However, he has also advocated for revamping legal immigration. In his February address to Congress, the president called for \"reforming our system of legal immigration\" and shifting to a merit-based system, citing Canada and Australia as models.\n\nSenator Cotton, from Arkansas, echoed Trump's rhetoric, making a populist case for his legislation. He argued that the current immigration system shows \"we're not committed to working-class Americans\" and puts \"great downward pressure on people who work with their hands and feet.\" He also claimed that the U.S. \"loses out on very best talent coming to our country\" under the current system.\n\nThe RAISE Act was first introduced by Cotton and Perdue in February, and although Trump has expressed support for the legislation, it faces bipartisan opposition and is unlikely to pass Congress in its current form. While Republicans have traditionally been united on the issue of illegal immigration, legal immigration is a more divisive topic within the party.\n\nMany pro-business Republicans have long supported legal immigration, and the new legislation is likely to exacerbate the divide between this wing of the party and more populist Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Trump, denounced the proposed reduction in legal immigration, stating it would \"be devastating to [South Carolina's] economy, which relies on this immigrant workforce.\"\n\nFor the Democrats, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told reporters the proposal to cut legal immigration \"doesn't make much sense\" and said his party would not support the plan. \"This is different than illegal immigration,\" Schumer said. \"This creates jobs in America. This helps America, and we think it's a non-starter.\"\n\nIn a heated exchange during a White House briefing, Senior White House aide Stephen Miller clashed with CNN anchor Jim Acosta over the policy. Acosta asked Miller if the proposal would violate the spirit of the poem New Colossus, inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty, which includes the line: \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nThe White House criticized Acosta for his \"cosmopolitan bias\" and attacked him for asking about what the bill would do to the racial composition of immigrants to the United States by saying: \"That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish things you've ever said.\"\n\nMiller later apologized to Acosta before leaving the lectern \"if things got heated\" but added that the CNN anchor \"made some pretty rough insinuations.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Approval Rating Remains Steady Amidst Controversies, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - President Barack Obama's approval rating remains steady, according to a new national poll, despite a tumultuous week that has seen the White House embroiled in three separate controversies.\n\nThe CNN/ORC International survey, released Sunday, indicates that the president's approval rating stands at 53%, with 45% disapproving. This is a two-point increase from CNN's last poll, conducted in early April. However, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes that this difference is within the poll's sampling error, and should not be characterized as a significant gain for the president.\n\nThe poll finds that more than seven in ten Americans view the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of tea party and other conservative groups as unacceptable. While both parties in Congress and the White House have criticized the IRS actions, congressional Republicans are portraying the controversy as an example of government overreach.\n\nThe poll also reveals that more than six in ten Americans believe the president's statements about the IRS scandal are truthful, with 35% disagreeing with his characterizations. Half of those surveyed believe the IRS acted independently, while 37% believe the White House ordered the targeting of tea party and conservative groups.\n\nThe administration's handling of the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, is also under scrutiny. Forty-two percent of the public are satisfied with the administration's response, while 53% are dissatisfied. This satisfaction level remains unchanged from November.\n\nRepublicans have accused the administration of intentionally misleading the public in the aftermath of the attack, with 44% of those surveyed agreeing that the administration's initial statements were an attempt to deceive. However, half of those questioned believe the administration's statements reflected their understanding of the situation at the time.\n\nThe poll also finds that 59% believe the U.S. government could have prevented the Benghazi attack, a significant increase from November. Only 37% believe congressional Republicans are overreacting in their handling of the matter.\n\nThe White House has also faced criticism over the Justice Department's secret collection of phone records from the Associated Press as part of a government investigation into classified leaks. The poll shows that 52% find the Justice Department's actions unacceptable, while 43% disagree.\n\nThe poll indicates that Americans are taking all three controversies seriously, with 55% considering the IRS and Benghazi matters very important to the nation, and 53% viewing the AP case in the same light.\n\nConfidence in the federal government remains low, with only 43% expressing a great deal or some confidence in those who run the government. However, 56% express a great deal or some confidence in the system of government.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International between May 17-18, with 923 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.",
    " Title: Rubio and Cruz Take Aim at Trump in Contentious Republican Debate Ahead of Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated and contentious debate, Republican candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took aim at front-runner Donald Trump, marking a significant shift in the party's primary race. The debate, moderated by Wolf Blitzer, saw a level of vitriol and personal attacks that has been largely absent in previous debates.\n\nFor the first time in ten debates and six months, Rubio and Cruz focused their attacks on Trump, criticizing his record, character, and policy platform. Rubio, in a memorable moment, described Trump's slogan as \"Everyone's dumb, he's going to make America great again. Win, win, win.\"\n\nRubio, armed with a series of comebacks and quick responses, seemed to relish in his ability to counter Trump's almost-clich\u00e9d insults. During a heated exchange about health care, Trump brought up Rubio's much-maligned gaffe where he repeated himself \"five times\" during the New Hampshire debates. Rubio responded, \"I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago.\"\n\nCruz also had several standout moments, with Glenn Beck, a Cruz supporter, calling it his best performance yet. This renewed energy and vigor seemed to revive hopes that Trump might not run away with the Republican nomination.\n\nHowever, Trump continued to leverage his familiar talking points against Rubio and Cruz, amping up the vitriol. Rubio was now a \"sweaty-faced 'choke artist'\" instead of just an inexperienced young man who kept \"repeating\" himself; Cruz was no longer just a \"liar\" who screwed over Carson in Iowa, but a \"basket case\" and a \"crazy zealot.\" Cruz responded in kind, asking Trump to \"get back on [his] meds.\"\n\nThe debate, which occurred just before Super Tuesday, left many questioning whether the chaos of the night would be enough to catapult either candidate into the front-runner position. With nearly half of the delegates needed to win the nomination on the line, it remains unclear who will emerge victorious in the coming days.",
    " Title: White House Optimistic as House Republican Healthcare Bill Faces Uncertain Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House expressed optimism Friday afternoon that the Republican-backed health care bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), would pass the House of Representatives despite speculation it was short of support ahead of an afternoon vote. The vote was postponed after administration officials fell short.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan were meeting to discuss the way forward on the bill. According to GOP lawmakers and congressional aides, House Republican leaders were short of the votes needed for the bill to pass.\n\nIn a bid to coax support from conservatives, House leaders proposed a fresh amendment repealing the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurers cover 10 specified services like maternity and mental health care. Conservatives have demanded the removal of those and other conditions the law imposes on insurers, arguing they drive up premiums.\n\nPresident Trump met with members of the Freedom Caucus Thursday in an effort to win them over. Trump told lawmakers still on the fence over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with the AHCA that voting against the White House-backed bill is tantamount to voting for Planned Parenthood.\n\nIf the bill passes, it will be a monumental achievement for Speaker Ryan and Trump. But if the bill stumbles, recriminations will abound. The House Rules Committee is expected to prepare the health care bill starting at 7 a.m. ET Friday. The House should be \"done in the afternoon,\" according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, but he noted that Democrats could delay things.\n\nDemocrats blasted what they saw as Republicans' amateurish maneuvering. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was a \"rookie's error\" to bring the legislation to a vote so early, and urged fellow Democrats to oppose the legislation. The AHCA would stop the Affordable Care Act's tax penalties against Americans who choose not to buy coverage, as well as cutting the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners. It would also give tax credits to help people pay medical bills, while allowing insurers to charge older Americans more. It would also repeal tax increases on high-earners and health companies.",
    " Title: President Trump Welcomes Home Three American Detainees from North Korea, Hails Improving U.S.-DPRK Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant diplomatic move, President Donald Trump welcomed home three American citizens who had been detained in North Korea on Thursday, in a dramatic early morning event at Joint Base Andrews. The three released prisoners, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang-duk (also known as Tony Kim), and Kim Hak-song, landed at the Maryland military facility at 2:42 a.m., greeted by President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, their respective wives, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe three men, who were accused by North Korea of anti-state activities, were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for further evaluation and medical treatment. The release is seen as a further sign of thawing relations between the U.S. and North Korea, following Kim Jong Un's pledge to suspend missile tests and close a nuclear test site last month.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the prisoners' arrival, President Trump expressed gratitude to Kim Jong Un for allowing the men to return before the planned summit between the two leaders. \"We want to thank Kim Jong Un,\" Trump said. \"We very much appreciate that he allowed them to go before the meeting. He was nice in letting them go before the meeting... That was a big thing, very important to me.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who facilitated the release of the men during a Wednesday trip to North Korea, also greeted the prisoners upon their arrival at Andrews. Pompeo had flown the three prisoners out of North Korea on his plane Wednesday to Yokota Air Base outside Tokyo, and they were then transported to Anchorage, Alaska, for refueling before arriving at Andrews.\n\nThe release of the three detainees comes amid renewed uncertainty regarding the upcoming summit between Trump and Kim, following the President's decision earlier this week to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The planned meeting between the two leaders would mark a historic first, and Pompeo's first visit to North Korea over Easter weekend marked the first known meeting between a U.S. official and a North Korean leader since then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father, in 2000.\n\nIn a statement released by the State Department on behalf of the former detainees, they expressed their deep appreciation to the U.S. government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the American people for bringing them home. One of the men spoke briefly with reporters through a translator, saying, \"We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home.\"\n\nPresident Trump predicted that the summit with Kim would be \"a very big success\" and suggested that his relationship with the North Korean leader is \"starting off on a new footing.\" Asked if he might visit North Korea, Trump responded, \"It could happen.\"\n\nThe ex-detainees' release and the planned summit between Trump and Kim mark a significant shift in the relationship between the two nations, following weeks last summer of exchanging threats and insults across the Pacific Ocean. The thawing of relations between the U.S. and North Korea offers hope for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula.",
    " Title: Tillerson Warns of 'Serious Mistrust' Between U.S. and Russia Over Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in the Philippines, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has warned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of the \"serious mistrust\" between the two nations due to Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Tillerson stated that Russia's actions had damaged the relationship, but added it was not \"useful to just cut everything off over one single issue.\"\n\nThe U.S. will respond by September 1 to Russia's expulsion of 755 staff from the U.S. embassy in Moscow, Tillerson said. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Kremlin attempted to help President Donald Trump during the election. Moscow vehemently denies any efforts to influence the U.S. election, and retaliatory sanctions passed by Congress last month have sparked a tit-for-tat.\n\nTillerson told Lavrov that there was now \"serious mistrust between our two countries and that we simply have to find some way to deal with that.\" He also indicated that the two countries may be able to come together to begin discussions on violence in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe comments by the former CEO of Exxon Mobil come less than a week after President Trump signed into law the new legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia for both election meddling and military actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The law also prevents Trump from lifting sanctions or returning Russian diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that were seized by the Obama administration in retaliation for the alleged meddling.\n\nTrump has failed to singularly point the finger at Moscow for the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the final stages of the election campaign. He has also condemned the investigations, which are also looking at whether his campaign team colluded with Moscow, as a \"witch hunt.\" After signing the bill, Trump decried it, arguing that it limited his ability to negotiate with Russia.",
    " Title: Central American Migrants Exploit Loopholes in U.S. Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nA surge in Central American families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has left the U.S. Border Patrol overwhelmed, with no place to house the influx of migrants until their cases can be adjudicated. As a result, the Border Patrol is releasing migrants with a promise that they will report to immigration officials weeks later.\n\nEdilberto Lanza Mejia, a 26-year-old from Honduras, is one such individual who was released at a bus station in McAllen, Texas, after crossing the border five days earlier with his wife and three children. Lanza told The Houston Chronicle that he borrowed a cellphone in the bus terminal and called his wife's sister in North Carolina, who paid for their fare to Greenville.\n\nThe Obama administration claims that the recent influx of families coming to Texas is due to violence in Central American countries. However, the flow of minors coming to the United States illegally has been steady for over a decade. According to The Christian Science Monitor, during the decade preceding fiscal year 2012, the federal government agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied minors who cross the border illegally dealt with an average of 7,000 to 8,000 cases a year. In fiscal year 2011, the number was 6,560, but it jumped to 13,625 the following year. This fiscal year, federal officials are estimating that the number could be 80,000, according to an internal memo cited by The New York Times.\n\nThe increase in unaccompanied minors who illegally cross the border can be attributed to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was implemented in 2012. DACA allows some undocumented immigrants who came to America as minors to defer deportation for two years. Last week, the administration announced guidelines for how these immigrants could defer deportation for a further two years.\n\nHowever, the time limits for \"temporary status\" through DACA make no logical, moral, or practical sense. The two-year time limit created by Obama makes no sense logically or morally, and it makes no more sense today than it did when it was first implemented. The arbitrary lines in the program, such as the age cutoff, also make no sense.\n\nCentral Americans have figured out that if President Obama won't deport DACA-eligible immigrants today, he won't deport new arrivals tomorrow either. They are calling BS on Obama's DACA lie. \"They're saying that women and children are allowed to stay,\" a recently detained undocumented immigrant from Guatemala told The Christian Science Monitor last week. \"If you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry has asked Obama to change his immigration policies, particularly the practice of releasing illegal immigrants into the United States with only a promise to appear in court. \"We need a policy change so we can send these families and children back home instead of turning them loose,\" a Homeland Security official told The Houston Chronicle.",
    " Title: New Disclosures Reveal Paul Manafort's Meetings with U.S. Officials in 2012-2013, Conflicting with Previous Claims by Mercury\n\nIn a recent development, disclosures filed with the Justice Department have revealed that President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, participated in meetings with at least one U.S. government official connected to the Russia-aligned political party he was representing in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAccording to the disclosures, Manafort, in conjunction with Vin Weber, a partner at the lobbying firm Mercury, met with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), former Arizona Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe of the International Republican Institute, Paula Dobriansky of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and Nadia Diuk of the National Endowment for Democracy. The lobbying effort was on behalf of a Brussels-based think tank that supported Ukraine's Party of Regions, headed at the time by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Manafort client.\n\nThe meetings, which had not been previously disclosed, conflict with Mercury's previous claims that it didn't coordinate with Manafort. The Brussels think tank, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, paid Mercury more than $1.2 million for work between May 2012 and May 2014, according to the disclosures.\n\nIn response to the revelations, Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, stated, \"One meeting with one lawmaker connected to this topic in a two-year period looks like incidental contact to fair-minded Americans.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Maloni said Manafort might report his foreign lobbying activities in response to advice from authorities. Manafort, a longtime associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone, was ousted from Trump's campaign in August following revelations by The New York Times about his work in Ukraine.\n\nMercury partner Michael McKeon said Manafort connected his Brussels think tank client to the firm. \"Manafort referred the client to us,\" McKeon said in a statement. \"At that time, he was widely recognized for his significant experience in Ukrainian politics and we felt his perspective would be meaningful in those few meetings. That was the extent of his involvement with us.\"\n\nWeber also accompanied former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko to a meeting with then-Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) in May 2012, according to the disclosures.\n\nMercury originally reported its lobbying for the think tank to Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which doesn't require firms to itemize each interaction and expense. However, lobbying for foreign governments and political parties has to be reported to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nMercury said it relied on assurances from the think tank that it wasn't funded or controlled by a foreign political party. \"We got it in writing so we could be sure we were doing it right, and relied on our counsel to make the proper determination,\" McKeon said.\n\nWhile violating the disclosure law is criminal, the office that enforces it usually settles for bringing lobbyists into compliance instead of bringing charges. The other lobbying firm working for the think tank, the Podesta Group, also retroactively filed with the Justice Department earlier this month.",
    " Title: Illinois Abortion Bills Spark Controversy and Protests in State Capitol\n\nArticle:\n\nA contentious debate over proposed abortion bills has ignited in the Illinois state capitol, with thousands of protestors rallying against what they deem as radical new legislation. The bills, which aim to increase access and provision for abortion, have sparked widespread outrage among residents, particularly due to a bill that allows abortions up until birth for any reason and another that removes the requirement for minors to notify their parents.\n\n\"There is widespread outcry from the people of Illinois against these extreme anti-women and anti-children bills since they were introduced a month ago,\" Illinois Right to Life Action's Mary Kate Knorr said. \"Residents from all corners of Illinois are expressing outrage at this proposed legislation, which disregards the health and safety of women.\"\n\nThe controversy mirrors the uproar caused by a similar law recently passed in New York. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker has expressed his intention to make Illinois the most progressive state in the nation for access to reproductive health care, a move that pro-lifers fear will become a reality.\n\nIllinois is already seen as a safe haven for those seeking abortions, with a new law allowing the state Medicaid program to fund them. Researchers on both sides of the debate have found that when taxpayers fund abortion, the numbers tend to increase.\n\n\"Essentially when the price of abortion goes down, the incidence increases, and if low-income women can get abortion subsidized through Medicaid programs, they're more likely to get abortions,\" stated Dr. Michael New of Catholic University.\n\nLast year, 5,528 women traveled to Illinois from other states to have abortions, a significant increase from the 4,543 women who did so in 2016. The total number of statewide abortions saw a similar increase, rising to 39,329 in 2017 from 38,382 in 2016.\n\nThe repeal of the Parent Notification of Abortion Act of 1995 could lead to an even greater increase in the annual number of abortions. The bill, which passed out of a state Senate committee Tuesday, will allow minors to make hasty decisions without parental consent to get an abortion.\n\nIn a seemingly contradictory twist, the bill's sponsor, State Sen. Elgie Sims, Jr. (D-Chicago), stated the goal of the new bill was to increase \"authentic family conversations.\"\n\n\"This bill is not an anti-family bill, it is a pro-family bill,\" he said. \"We cannot have and force inauthentic conversations between families. The state of Illinois has no place.\"\n\nState Sen. Jason Plummer (R-Edwardsville) argued against the progressive measure at the committee meeting.\n\n\"We're talking about the termination of a life, right?\" he said. \"And so, for there to be maybe a hurdle or two there, I don't think as a society is necessarily the worst thing because... we're talking about the termination of a heartbeat, and that's a significant concern of mine.\"\n\nThe other bill, the Reproductive Health Act, would establish abortion as a fundamental right. The measure includes a mandatory rule for private insurance companies to cover abortion and grants physician-assistants the opportunity to perform abortions.\n\nRep. Terri Bryant (R-Murphysboro) argues the bill has nothing to do with reproductive health.\n\n\"I feel a little bit like I've fallen through the rabbit hole,\" stated Bryant. \"Everything is upside-down, backwards, and inside-out in just using the name.\"\n\nIllinois Right to Life Action reports that if these bills are enacted, Illinois would become a third-trimester abortion destination, with no abortion subject to state inspection. Since 2011, at least four abortion facilities have shut down due to failed state inspections. The progressive measures have been introduced by Democrats in both chambers, but only the Senate is seeing success as the measure is stalled in the House.",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Approach: A Shift from Obama's Diplomacy of Engagement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the diplomatic approach of his predecessor, President Donald Trump has taken a more assertive stance in foreign policy matters. While President Barack Obama, during his tenure, focused on engaging with Islamic nations to counter terrorism, Trump has chosen to define and confront the enemy more directly.\n\nObama, the 44th president, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, but his approach to Islam was criticized by some as soft, leading to a world that was closer to the brink of a potential clash of civilizations. Trump, on the other hand, has faced criticism for his approach, but has received no formal recognition for his efforts.\n\nThe media's focus on Trump's personal matters, such as his wife's wardrobe, during his first international trip as president, has been a point of contention. The media's coverage of the trip, according to some, has lacked substance, focusing more on personal attacks rather than discussing the state of American foreign policy and the challenges the nation faces.\n\nTrump's election was in part due to his promise to address the threats to the nation, both domestically and internationally. His priorities, clear and unambiguous, have been a departure from those of his opponents.\n\nIn the Middle East, Trump has advocated for alliances of convenience rather than seeking loyal allies outside of Israel, the region's only democracy. This pragmatic approach, while cold and cynical, is seen as a more realistic approach to the complexities of the region.\n\nThe Bush administration, under President George W. Bush, had also advocated for this approach, declaring in the War on Terror that you were either with them or against them. However, the Bush administration's focus shifted towards Wilsonian liberal interventionism, a policy that Trump aims to distance the United States from.\n\nTrump's foreign policy does not signal a retreat from American power, but rather a shift towards a more pragmatic and realistic approach to global affairs. The president's tour, which began with a truthful address in Saudi Arabia, is expected to continue with a clear message that the United States will not tolerate actions contrary to its interests in the Middle East.",
    " Title: \"The Impact of YouTube on Health Information and the Widening Health Literacy Disparities in the U.S.\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study reveals that 75% of Americans turn to the internet, particularly YouTube, for health and medical information. This trend has led public health agencies to invest in YouTube as a platform for health communication, with patients with chronic health conditions relying on social media, including YouTube videos, for managing their conditions. However, the study warns that video recommendations on such sites could exacerbate existing health literacy disparities.\n\nThe National Assessment of Adult Literacy conducted in 2003 estimated that only 12% of adults had proficient health literacy skills. This figure has been corroborated in subsequent studies. As a professor of information systems, Anjana Susarla's research has shown that social media platforms like YouTube widen health literacy disparities by steering users towards questionable content.\n\nSusarla's research found that the most popular and engaging videos are significantly less likely to have medically valid information. Users typically encounter health-related videos through keyword searches on YouTube, with YouTube providing links to authenticated medical information, such as the top-ranked results. However, when physicians were recruited to watch the videos and rate them on validity and understandability from a patient education perspective, they rated YouTube's recommendations poorly.\n\nThe most popular videos tend to have easily understandable information but are not always medically valid. A study on the most popular videos on COVID-19 found that a quarter of videos did not contain medically valid information. This is because the algorithms' underlying recommendations on social media platforms are biased towards engagement and popularity.\n\nUsers with greater health literacy are more likely to discover usable medical advice from reputable health care providers, such as the Mayo Clinic. On the other hand, less literate users are steered towards fake cures or misleading medical advice. This could be especially harmful for minority groups, as studies of health literacy in the United States have found that the impact of limited health literacy disproportionately impacts minorities.\n\nCorrecting algorithmic biases and providing better information to users of technology platforms would go a long way in promoting equity. For example, a pioneering study by the Gender Shades project examined disparities in identifying gender and skin type across different companies that provide commercial facial recognition software. It concluded that companies were able to make progress in reducing these disparities once issues were pointed out.\n\nDigital platforms, where anyone can engage, make them vulnerable to misinformation, accentuating health literacy disparities. Social media and search companies have partnered with health organizations such as the Mayo Clinic to provide validated information and reduce the spread of misinformation. To make health information on YouTube more equitable, those who design recommendation algorithms would have to incorporate feedback from clinicians and patients as well as end users.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Block $84 Billion Tax Cut Bill Amid Dispute Over Amendments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked an $84 billion tax cut bill, marking the second time in less than a week that a procedural impasse has derailed legislation. The bill, which aimed to revive a series of expired tax breaks, failed to clear a procedural hurdle due to widespread objections from Republicans over the lack of opportunity to propose amendments, including one targeting the Obamacare medical device tax.\n\nThe vote, which was 53-40, fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance the measure. The dispute comes just days after a similar impasse scuttled an energy efficiency bill and a vote on the Keystone Pipeline, signaling six more months of gridlock and partisan bickering if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cannot forge a working relationship before the November election.\n\nLawmakers are now uncertain about the future of the so-called tax extenders, a collection of temporary provisions that benefit teachers, commuters, banks, and others. Some Republicans expressed hope for a brief delay, but the party's top tax writer admitted the move could postpone the legislation until after this year's midterm elections.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) expressed his support for the Republican stance, stating, \"Don't we care a little more about freedom and the right to bring up your amendments and the right to be a participant in the process? We've always had rights around here, and that's what's involved here, that's what the whole thing is about. It's not about trying to stop this bill\u2014it's saying, 'Look, we've had enough of this crap.'\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) criticized the Republican vote, stating, \"Republicans can't take 'yes' for an answer\u2014they just voted against the second bipartisan bill in less than a week. That's what just happened: the Republicans voted against tax cuts. So maybe the Republicans will hear from their friends down on K Street and around the country and maybe they will learn this is pretty important to everybody.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kirk of Illinois was the only Republican to side with the Democrats. Lawmakers will spend the weekend and the first couple of days of next week attempting to work out an amendment deal, aides in both parties said. The GOP leadership began whipping their members to vote down the bill on Wednesday, and by Thursday's caucus lunch, Republicans had agreed to take a stand against Reid.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed a desire to vote on the bill but also to vote on repealing the medical device tax. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) stated, \"Republicans are outraged that we've basically been frozen out of the process.\" Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) predicted any delay on the bill would be brief, arguing the chamber could still complete work on the bill by Memorial Day. However, if not, Coats suggested it might not make much difference because lawmakers were unlikely to sort out a final plan for the tax provisions with the House until a post-election lame-duck session.",
    " Title: Government Funding Battle Looms as Congress Averts Shutdown Temporarily\n\nArticle:\n\nThe immediate threat of a government shutdown has been temporarily alleviated, but the looming funding battle in December is set to intensify. The current fiscal year ends on September 30, and lawmakers will need to agree on a new funding bill to avoid another shutdown.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's \"State of the Union,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stated that a continuing resolution will be necessary to take the government forward as they prepare for the omnibus bill, which will fund the government through the next year.\n\nThe Senate will make the first move to steer Congress away from a shutdown, with a key procedural vote on Monday evening on a bill that would fund the government through Dec. 11 and not strip money from Planned Parenthood. This short-term spending bill is expected to pass with bipartisan support, with no issues in clinching the 60 votes needed to advance.\n\nAfter the Senate passes the stopgap measure, the House will follow suit, and the bill will be sent to President Barack Obama for his signature, averting the second federal government shutdown since 2013.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a government shutdown on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) replied, \"No.\" Boehner acknowledged that he'll have to tap Democratic support for the bill but added, \"I expect my Democrat colleagues want to keep the government open as much as I do.\"\n\nInstead of focusing on the government funding battle, House Republicans are redirecting their energy into investigating Planned Parenthood over allegations of profiting from fetal tissue sales. The House GOP announced over the weekend that they will establish a select committee to probe these accusations, which have caused a stir on the right.\n\nIn addition, the House will vote on more measures restricting abortion, and they will draft a reconciliation measure to defund Planned Parenthood. On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will take up a reconciliation bill that bars funding for the women's health group for one year and a public health fund established under Obamacare.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Congress has the option to use reconciliation, a procedural weapon that can sidestep a filibuster in the Senate and send a bill straight to Obama. However, the rules in the Senate are more complicated, and GOP leaders have not yet indicated whether they'll follow suit and use the procedural tool to strip funding from Planned Parenthood.\n\nSome House conservatives were not satisfied with the leadership's strategy when it was unveiled last week, lobbying instead to push the funding fight to the brink of a shutdown. However, they were resigned to the fact that a spending bill without Planned Parenthood restrictions was inevitable.\n\nThe outcome of the funding fight in December is far from certain, and the government shutdown threat will return with a vengeance.",

The grim figure was released by UN agencies on Friday.\n\n\"This one millionth child refugee is not just another number,\" said Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, the UN children's agency. \"This is a real child ripped from home, maybe even from a family, facing horrors we can only begin to comprehend.\"\n\nThe statistic was released as the UN pushes for an immediate investigation of an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus. The Syrian government has refuted the accusation, calling it \"illogical and fabricated,\" according to the BBC. However, unverified footage shows civilians, many of them children, apparently suffering horrific symptoms, as well as rows of shrouded bodies. Chemical weapons experts have told the BBC that the footage appears genuine and that the injuries shown are consistent with nerve agents.\n\nOn Friday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon renewed calls for UN inspectors to be allowed to investigate the claims immediately. \"I can think of no good reason why any party, either government or opposition forces, would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter,\" the UN chief said, according to Reuters.\n\nAs the Daily Beast reports, the UN is acting quickly as pressure mounts across the globe in the face of the allegations. UN's top disarmament representative, Angela Kane, will fly to Syria, which has received a formal request for access to the suburb where more than a thousand died in what appears to be the largest attack so far in the Syrian conflict. The UN team currently inside Syria is only authorized to investigate three of the 13 sites deemed suspicious before Wednesday's attack. Meanwhile, France has urged that force be used if the use of chemical weapons is confirmed.\n\nSyria has become the worst refugee crisis since the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Some 100,000 people have been killed since protests broke out against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. Refugees have been fleeing to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt, and increasingly North Africa and Europe.\n\nChildren are among the most vulnerable. While 1 million have been forced to flee the violence, the UN says that 2 million others are displaced within the country. \"The youth of Syria are losing their homes, their family members, and their futures,\" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.\n\nEducation is a top long-term concern, as these children are part of a so-called \"lost generation\" that won't easily be able to bring stability to their country in the future, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes. Few have been able to study or receive psychological counseling.\n\nThroughout the region, one of the biggest concerns for Syrian refugee families is finding schooling for their children, who make up 48 percent of the Syrian refugee population and are unable to attend official schooling in their host countries. The longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to eventually return, according to a March report from Save the Children. In Jordan, CARE found that more than 60 percent of school-age children are not attending any classes, despite the availability of free schooling. For most parents, the auxiliary costs associated with schooling, such as transportation, supplies, and lunches, prove an insurmountable barrier.\n\nOn Friday, UNICEF officials urged the international community to respond to the problem, which it says belongs to everybody. \"We must all share the shame,\" said UNICEF's Mr. Lake. \"Because while we work to alleviate the suffering of those affected by this crisis, the global community has failed in its responsibility to this child. We should stop and ask ourselves how, in all conscience, we can continue to fail the children of Syria.\"\n\nHowever, as Michael Gerson in The Washington Post shows, the limits on countries that are responding to Syrian children who have been forced to leave their homes are evident. The international community must take urgent action to address the plight of these children and ensure their future.",
    " Title: U.S. Special Forces Assist Kurdish Forces in Securing Highway 47 from ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint operation, the Kurdish forces, known as the pesh merga, have managed to secure a significant portion of Highway 47, cutting off a major supply route for the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) between Syria and the city of Mosul in Iraq. The operation, which involved both air and ground support from American forces, has resulted in the Kurdish forces controlling approximately 22 miles of Highway 47, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nThe pesh merga had acquired a small number of armored American Humvees, left behind by the Iraqi Army during last year's rapid offensive by ISIS. However, they faced challenges with another piece of captured American equipment, a heavily armored personnel carrier, which broke down and had to be towed.\n\nThe operation began with the pesh merga reaching the base of Mount Sinjar, a moment that was celebrated with Kurdish music and dancing. After a brief respite for food, the forces were back on the move, approaching Highway 47. The sound of military jets and the thud of explosions grew closer as A-10 attack planes and B-1 heavy bombers joined the operation, according to American command.\n\nRoughly two dozen United States Special Forces members were serving as advisers to the pesh merga forces, with half of them stationed at the main headquarters at the foot of Mount Sinjar. The other dozen were spread along the long mountain ridge to advise Kurdish airstrike spotters as they chose targets.\n\nGeneral Waisi's Kurdish force, known as the Zeravani Force, spread out to secure a broader swath of the highway west of Sinjar. However, other forces working in parallel were engaged in different sections of the operation. By midday, the joint operation had successfully cut off one of the main supply routes for ISIS, marking a significant victory in the ongoing fight against the extremist group.",
    " Title: Former Republican Lawmakers Urge Congressional Republicans to Oppose President Trump's Emergency Declaration\n\nAn open letter signed by a group of former Republican lawmakers has been released, urging Congressional Republicans to block President Trump's emergency declaration. The letter, published by Politico on Monday, calls on Congress to support a joint resolution ending the national emergency declared by President Trump earlier this month.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by five former Senators and 19 House members, argues that the national emergency declaration represents an expansion of executive authority that could be used against Republicans by a future Democratic administration.\n\n\"We who have signed this letter are no longer Members of Congress but that oath still burns within us,\" the former lawmakers write. \"That is why we are coming together to urge those of you who are now charged with upholding the authority of the first branch of government to resist efforts to surrender those powers to a president.\"\n\nThe former lawmakers, who served between 1967 and 2013, point out that President Trump resorted to a national emergency declaration after Republicans on a specially-designated conference committee failed to secure the $5.7 billion the President had long demanded for the construction of a border wall as part of a broader spending package.\n\nThe House will vote this week on a resolution to end the national emergency, which has thus far received the support of only one Republican, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan. The letter's signatories embrace a common critique of the national emergency declaration, arguing that the expansion of executive authority could eventually be used against Republicans by a future Democratic administration.\n\n\"What will you do when a president of another party uses the precedent you are establishing to impose policies to which you are unalterably opposed?\" they ask. \"There is no way around this difficulty: what powers are ceded to a president whose policies you support may also be used by presidents whose policies you abhor.\"\n\nThe letter serves as a reminder of the ongoing political divide over the President's emergency declaration, and the potential long-term consequences of such a move. The outcome of the House vote this week will provide insight into the level of support for the President's border wall funding and the national emergency declaration among Congressional Republicans.",
    " Title: Trump's Unprecedented Presidency: Pushing Boundaries and Reshaping the Office\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from traditional presidential dynamics, President Donald Trump has emerged as the most influential figure in American politics, despite being the most unpopular first-year president in modern history. This unprecedented approach to governance has raised questions about the potential for a president to reshape the country without a broader mandate.\n\nAccording to Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, Trump is redefining the presidency, operating outside the boundaries that have been expected or accepted for over two centuries. Trump's approach, Beschloss explains, is, \"I'm not going to operate just within the boundaries that the founders might have expected or people might have expected for 200 years. I'm going to operate within the boundaries of what is strictly legal, and I'm going to push those boundaries if I can.\"\n\nTrump's presidency has indeed shattered traditional boundaries, as noted by William M. Daley, who served two presidents, first as a cabinet secretary under Bill Clinton and then as White House chief of staff under Barack Obama. \"Everyone else seemed to play within a certain box,\" Daley said. \"But this one is totally outside the box.\"\n\nIn recent times, most presidents have sought to expand the power of their office. Trump, like his predecessors, has continued this trend, using his executive power to enact sweeping policies. However, Trump has shown a unique disregard for the restraints imposed on the presidency, lashing out at judges, lawmakers, investigators, and journalists who cross him. His sense of government is not based on coalition building or a balancing act between equal branches. Instead, he deems what is necessary, and the system should fall in line.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump asserted that he has an \"absolute right\" to order the Justice Department to open or close investigations into himself or his foes. While some lawyers argue that the Constitution grants him wide latitude over the executive branch, no other president has publicly asserted such power in such a raw political fashion. Critics have warned that thwarting the special counsel's Russia investigation could lead to impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe talk of \"absolute\" power and Trump's noted affinity for foreign strongmen have fueled fears of authoritarianism. For the most part, Trump, with some notable exceptions, has demonstrated more bark than bite. However, his rhetoric has become a power unto itself, and the question remains whether he will follow through on his threats in the next stage of his tenure or whether his attacks will prove ultimately self-defeating.",
    " Title: Veteran Reflects on Service in Korea and Advocacy for Gold Star Families\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant reflection, Dr. John A. Lejeune, a veteran of the Vietnam War and the Korean War, shares his experiences serving in the U.S. Army during the tumultuous era of the 1970s. Dr. Lejeune, who was drafted in 1971 and initially ordered to Vietnam, found himself instead stationed at Camp Casey in South Korea, a last-minute change that he often wonders might have saved his life.\n\nDr. Lejeune served in the 2nd Infantry Division's Army Medical Corps, a unique unit with a rich history. The 2nd Infantry Division, 2nd Medical Battalion is the only Army infantry division to have been led by Marine Corps Generals, Major General John A. Lejeune and Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen. The 2nd Infantry Division is also renowned for its World War I victory at the Battle of Belleau Wood, earning the infamous nickname for Marines, 'Devil Dogs.'\n\nBefore Korea, Dr. Lejeune was in medical school, learning in a sterile hospital and practicing with proper medical tools. However, Korea was a far cry from the controlled environment of a hospital. \"Practicing medicine in a war zone was a bit more like practicing medicine in Gettysburg circa 1863,\" he recalls. The medical tools were limited, and they did not even have the means to perform a basic blood count, but they did have a microscope.\n\nAs Memorial Day approaches, Dr. Lejeune reflects on his time serving during the Vietnam era. He thinks of the three doctors, Dr. Tom Cherry, Dr. Mike Fichette, and Dr. John Strauss, with whom he worked to care for nearly 10,000 infantrymen. He recalls the lives of the two soldiers they saved who were suffering from extreme heat exhaustion after storming a hill days before Memorial Day in 1973. But mostly, he thinks about the fallen.\n\n\"Memorial Day is when we reflect upon, and honor, their lives and the impact of their sacrifices,\" Dr. Lejeune says. \"It is about those that left behind their loved ones and the comforts of home, never to return.\" He notes that the revered saying, 'land of the free, because of the brave,' is true because of them.\n\nDr. Lejeune is passionate about finding ways to ease the burdens of Gold Star families, the families of our nation's fallen heroes. In this regard, he is particularly proud of the Forever GI Bill, a bill he authored that allows eligible veterans to use their GI Bill benefits at any point in their lifetime and makes Fry Scholarship participants eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Fry Scholarship allows Gold Star Family members to use the educational benefits their family member never had the chance to, and this Congress, Dr. Lejeune's friend and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), introduced the Fry Scholarship Improvement Act of 2019. This bill would extend eligibility for the Fry Scholarship to surviving spouses and children of deceased National Guard and Reserve members whose deaths are deemed service-connected by VA, but who died while not on active-duty if the death occurred within four years of the servicemember's last discharge.\n\nOn this Memorial Day, Dr. Lejeune challenges everyone to find a way to honor those who lost their life in service. This can be done in many ways, such as saying a prayer, going to your local VA cemetery and laying a wreath on a gravesite, calling your member of Congress and advocating for veterans issues you care about, or volunteering with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO). There are many incredible VSOs to choose from, and many that focus specifically on honoring our nation's fallen, such as America's Gold Star Families, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and the Travis Manion Foundation.\n\n\"It is an honor to be a veteran, but it is far greater an honor to spend my days working to advance causes that serve and support them and their families,\" Dr. Lejeune concludes. \"While every morning I give thanks for those who have borne the battle on our behalf and those who continue to today, on Memorial Day I give thanks for those who made the ultimate sacrifice.\" It fills him with pride and joy to live in this great nation that exists because of those sacrifices, and he prays for every life lost fighting for our freedom.",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Reach Principle Agreement on Farm Bill, Aiming to Deliver New Legislation by Year's End\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - U.S. lawmakers have reached a preliminary agreement on the Farm Bill, the top agriculture lawmakers and senators announced on Thursday, concluding months of partisan debate over the legislation that funds $867 billion in food and agriculture programs.\n\nIn a joint statement, the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees stated, \"We are pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement in principle on the 2018 Farm Bill. We are working to finalize legal and report language as well as CBO scores, but we still have more work to do. We are committed to delivering a new farm bill to America as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe programs covered by the bill include crop subsidies and support to access export markets, areas vital for American farmers, a significant constituency of U.S. President Donald Trump. The funding is crucial as farmers face challenges due to Trump's trade wars with key commercial partners such as China, the top buyer of U.S. farm produce but which has been absent from the market after the imposition of tariffs.\n\nThe latest bill, passed in 2014, expired on Sept. 30 after talks over its replacement broke down. The main point of contention in the debate was whether or not to impose stricter work requirements for recipients of food stamps. Recently, the main standoff had focused on forestry provisions following the deadly wildfires in California.\n\nThe agreement is yet to be integrated into the text of the legislation, and lawmakers will have to decide whether it will be voted on as a standalone bill or within a larger package. Once voted on, the bill goes to the president for final signature. Lawmakers have until the end of the year to finalize the process.",
    " Title: U.S. Defense Secretary's Visit to Iraq Met with Resistance over Turkish Involvement in Mosul Offensive\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter's unannounced visit to Baghdad on Saturday aimed to persuade Iraq to allow Turkey to participate in the battle against the Islamic State for Mosul, but Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has rejected the proposal. Al-Abadi stated through a translator that Iraqi, Kurdish, and other local forces are capable of handling the battle for Mosul without external assistance.\n\nIraqi forces, in coalition with Kurdish peshmerga soldiers, American advisers, and various ethnic minority paramilitary units, began a large-scale offensive on Monday to recapture Mosul, which was overrun by Islamic State militants in 2014.\n\nWhile acknowledging Iraq's sovereignty, the U.S. goal is to resolve disputes between coalition partners to effectively fight the common enemy, according to Carter, as reported by the Associated Press. Carter expressed confidence in planning a constructive role for the U.S. in Iraq.\n\nCarter's visit follows the death of a U.S. service member, who worked with Iraqi special forces as an explosives-disposal specialist, outside Mosul. This marks the fourth death since the U.S. began military operations in the region in August 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, an assault on the Iranian-run power plant and police stations in the oil city of Kirkuk on Friday resulted in the deaths of 80 people, mostly Kurdish security forces, and injuries to 170 others, according to Brig. Gen. Khattab Omer of the Kirkuk police. The attack was described as a counter-attack by suspected Islamic State fighters.\n\nIn another development, hundreds were treated for breathing problems due to a burning sulfur plant set ablaze Thursday in Mishraq, south of Mosul. Residents reported coughing, headaches, and nosebleeds from the gray smoke.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office reported on Friday that hundreds of families were forced out of villages and herded toward Mosul for potential use as human shields by the Islamic State. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, expressed concern over the possibility of the militants using these vulnerable people as human shields or killing them.\n\nThe militants forced about 200 families out of Samali and 350 families out of Najalfia on Monday, according to the human rights office. At least 40 civilians were shot dead in one of the villages outside Mosul, under a report the office is investigating.",
    " Title: White House Pushes for Eased Guantanamo Transfer Restrictions as Lawmakers Express Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is once again resurfacing on Capitol Hill, as the White House seeks to loosen restrictions on transferring detainees out of the Cuba-based prison camp. The move comes despite warnings from some lawmakers about the potential risks associated with releasing former detainees, who have been suspected of returning to the battlefield.\n\nLawmakers opposed to swift action on Guantanamo have long voiced concerns about recidivism among former detainees. An official estimate from last year indicated that nearly 28 percent of former detainees were suspected of rejoining the battlefield.\n\nHowever, administration officials are hoping to leverage a Senate defense policy bill to advance their long-standing goal of moving detainees out of Guantanamo and, eventually, shutting it down. The bill, set for debate in the coming days, would allow for the transfer of prisoners who have been cleared for overseas transfer but are still being held due, in part, to a complex Pentagon certification process.\n\nThe bill would ease these restrictions and lift a ban on bringing suspected terrorist prisoners from Guantanamo to the United States for detention, trial, or emergency medical treatment.\n\nThe White House's efforts face staunch resistance, with opponents pointing to instances where former detainees have re-engaged in terrorist activities after their release from the remote U.S. naval prison in Cuba.\n\n\"Why would you want to lower the standard?\" asked Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), who, along with Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), is working on amendments to preserve the current high bar for transfers.\n\nEven if the Senate passes the White House-backed legislation, the House earlier this year approved a measure that further restricts transfers, including an outright ban on sending detainees to Yemen. Yemen is a significant challenge, as more than half of the 164 detainees are from there and it is home to the world's most active Al Qaeda branch.\n\nObama himself imposed a ban on Yemeni transfers from Guantanamo after a Nigerian man attempted to detonate a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas 2009 with explosives hidden in his underwear on instructions from Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen. However, Obama lifted that moratorium in his May 23 speech at National Defense University, stating that Guantanamo \"has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.\"\n\n\"I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the United States. These restrictions make no sense,\" Obama said. He has vowed to close the prison.\n\n\"There is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened,\" Obama said.\n\nPurely from an economic perspective, the administration argues that Guantanamo is too costly. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress that annual spending on Guantanamo was $454 million\u2014or about $2.7 million per detainee.\n\nObama has not publicly discussed Guantanamo in the six months since the speech, but administration officials say he presses Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry on the matter every week. Obama also has new special envoys for Guantanamo closure at the State Department and Pentagon working full time on the matter.\n\n\"Our marching orders are very clear from the president, and in terms of what he wants to do, and that's to close the facility,\" said envoy Clifford Sloan at the State Department.\n\nSloan stated that achieving the goal requires three steps: transferring out those who have been approved, prosecuting others, and making a plan for the remaining detainees accused of participating in dangerous plots who cannot be prosecuted because the evidence against them is inadmissible in a court of law. That's a tall order on a three-year clock, but Sloan vowed, \"Step by step, we will get there, and we will close it.\"\n\nSloan has been holding meetings across Capitol Hill to push for more flexibility, while Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser in the White House, has been calling moderate senators to encourage them to back the Senate bill.\n\nThe Senate bill would allow the Pentagon to transfer any detainee the administration no longer considers a threat to the United States, as long as actions are taken to \"substantially mitigate the risk\" that the detainee would re-engage in terrorism and ensure that the transfer is in the national security interest of the United States.\n\nThis summer, the administration sent home two Algerian detainees. Eighty-four others have long been cleared for transfer, and the U.S. government has begun a formal review process of about 45 others previously considered too dangerous to be released to determine if circumstances have changed.\n\nAyotte argued that the current process is working, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) agreed that the administration does not need more flexibility. \"All they have to do is assure us that they won't re-enter the fight, as numerous ones have, in leadership positions. We can't do that,\" McCain said.\n\nChris Anders, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, which wants to close Guantanamo, acknowledges the issue is always a tough vote for lawmakers but argues there's a growing recognition that Guantanamo can't stay open forever and harms national security.\n\n\"What's different this year compared to past years is that the president is ready and willing to use whatever authority Congress gives him to start closing Guantanamo, and particularly to start sending home the majority of detainees who were long ago cleared to be sent back home,\" Anders said.",
    " Title: Obama's Balanced Approach to Ferguson: A Tactful Response Amidst Racial Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his White House remarks on the Ferguson situation, President Barack Obama sought to strike a delicate balance, expressing empathy towards the community's outrage over the killing of Michael Brown while also emphasizing the importance of addressing black crime. This delicate dance is particularly challenging for the nation's first black president, who has been criticized for his approach.\n\nPolitico described Obama as \"guarded, reserved, and deeply clinical\" in his remarks, with many feeling that he kept a clear emotional distance. Despite his lengthy discussion on Ferguson, some were left wanting more, with what he didn't say being a point of contention.\n\nOn Fox, Charles Krauthammer criticized Obama for his response, stating that he should have been more direct in condemning the violence and chaos that has engulfed Ferguson. Krauthammer argued that Obama's instrumental approach to the issue was insufficient, and that he should have expressed that such actions are wrong, not just ineffective.\n\nIt is true that Obama has been criticized for his unemotional demeanor in many of his recent appearances. However, the current situation in Ferguson, marked by nightly confrontations with police, numerous arrests, and shootings, calls for a measured response.\n\nObama's comments on Ferguson were characterized by an effort to differentiate lawful dissent from violence, a call for peaceful protest, and a show of sympathy for African-Americans. He acknowledged the mistrust between local residents and law enforcement, and the overrepresentation of young men of color in the criminal justice system.\n\nHowever, he also emphasized the need to prosecute lawbreakers, regardless of their race or the root causes of their actions. Obama's measured approach to Ferguson, while criticized by some for its lack of drama, has been praised for its ability to deescalate a volatile situation.",
    " Title: Trump's \"War on Christmas\": A Divisive and Unnecessary Crusade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a nation as diverse as the United States, the celebration of religious holidays often reflects the cultural melange that defines the country. For one interfaith couple, their holiday season is a unique blend of traditions, celebrating Christmas with a tree, presents, eggnog, and Nat King Cole's Christmas album, while also enjoying traditional Indian dishes and customs with their friends. However, in Donald Trump's America, this harmonious celebration could become a battleground in his self-proclaimed \"War on Christmas.\"\n\nAt various stops on his post-election victory tour, Trump has reiterated his commitment to ending the so-called \"War on Christmas\" and encouraging the widespread use of \"Merry Christmas\" instead of the more inclusive \"Happy Holidays.\" In a country with a rich and diverse religious landscape, this rhetoric has sparked controversy and concern.\n\nTrump's crusade against perceived anti-Christian sentiment has seen him publicly shaming businesses he deems insufficiently Christmas-themed, such as Starbucks, which he criticized for redesigning their cups to emphasize a generic holiday theme rather than a Christmas one. He has even threatened to evict Starbucks from his hotel and encouraged boycotts of the coffee chain.\n\nIf Trump's rhetoric translates into policy, the potential for government intervention in corporate practices is alarming. The President could use his executive power to scrutinize businesses, potentially through IRS audits or OSHA inspections, for perceived anti-Christian bias. This could lead to a dangerous level of government intrusion and religious persecution.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that both extremes - the progressive attempt to remove all religious symbols from public spaces and Trump's aggressive promotion of Christmas - are problematic. The First Amendment's purpose is to protect religious freedom, not to create religion-free zones or to suppress minority religions. A truly pluralistic society allows for the expression of various religions, fostering tolerance and understanding, rather than driving religious practices behind closed doors.\n\nTrump's \"Make America Say Merry Christmas Again\" campaign risks turning Christians from victims to victimizers, creating a divisive and hostile environment for religious minorities. This could push religious minorities towards progressive protection and legal action, escalating the culture wars. It could also force those who are not particularly religious but embrace cultural defaults to reconsider their actions, potentially leading to passive resistance and anti-Christmas subversion.\n\nIn a nation as diverse as the United States, it is essential to promote understanding, tolerance, and respect for all religions. Trump's \"War on Christmas\" is not the solution; instead, it risks creating a more divided and hostile society. It is hoped that Trump will reconsider his crusade and instead work towards fostering a more inclusive and respectful environment for all Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs.",
    " Title: Trump's Ongoing War on the Media: Implications and Responses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump's antagonism towards the media continues unabated. At a recent meeting with top television executives, Trump reportedly berated the networks for their \"outrageous\" and \"dishonest\" coverage, and, according to a source, he told CNN chief Jeff Zucker that \"everyone at the network is a liar and you should be ashamed.\"\n\nOn the same day, instead of holding a press conference where journalists might ask him difficult or uncomfortable questions, Trump opted to release a YouTube video updating the public on the White House transition, which he said had proceeded \"very smoothly, efficiently, and effectively.\"\n\nAs President, Trump's mistrust of the media will likely make life challenging for journalists aiming to provide the public with a clear view of presidential decision-making. It is worth noting that presidential animosity towards the press is not a new phenomenon. Presidents have long grappled with a press corps they perceive as unsympathetic, distorting their words for the news, making it difficult to communicate effectively with the American public.\n\nTo counter this, presidents have historically reduced the number of press conferences they hold while increasing the amount of communication they do through other means. The emergence of social media has allowed Trump to take this trend to the next level. While distasteful and dysfunctional, the Republic will not fall just because journalists have to watch YouTube to learn what Trump's been up to.\n\nHowever, the deeper danger lies in Trump's war on the media undermining the media as an effective forum for debate and deliberation. By avoiding engagement with journalists and stifling media critics through public shaming and other strong-arm tactics, Trump will weaken the ability of the press to play the role of watchdog and critic envisioned by the Founders and embodied in the First Amendment. By attacking the media's objectivity and credibility, the Trump administration will weaken what's left of public confidence in the public sphere and, by extension, in the entire project of democratic self-governance.\n\nTrump currently enjoys a disturbing level of support for his assault on the news media. In a post-election Pew survey, for example, just 22 percent of Americans gave the press either an A or B for its campaign coverage, with 59 percent giving it a D or F. A September 2016 Gallup poll found that just 32 percent of the public trust the press a fair amount or a great deal to report news \"fully, accurately, and fairly,\" the lowest figure since Gallup first asked the question in 1976.\n\nThe timing of Trump's war on the media is not coincidental. The media have become an arena of conflict in the partisan battles of an increasingly polarized political system. To those who believe that the media exhibits a liberal bias, Trump is a welcome corrective. Not surprisingly, the recent collapse of trust has been driven primarily by Republicans, just 14 percent of whom now believe the mass media deserves even a fair amount of trust compared to 30 percent of independents and 51 percent of Democrats.\n\nA related trend is the increasing Balkanization of news audiences around competing news sources. As a 2014 Pew study showed, for example, 47 percent of \"consistent conservatives\" name Fox News as their primary (and trusted) source of news about politics, while almost completely avoiding other major news outlets like The New York Times.\n\nEven more concerning is the fact that the trend appears most pronounced among younger Americans, who tend to be somewhat more liberal than their parents. In 2016, just 26 percent of those under the age of 50 trusted the news media compared to 38 percent of those age 50 or older. Nor does the advent of social media help. Just 34 percent of American adults who use the web trust the information they get from social media sources.\n\nHow Trump will deal with the media and how the media will respond to Trump remains to be seen. The past 30 years or so do not provide much hope for optimism. The news industry has been pummeled by the fragmentation of the news audience and the emergence of the Internet. In the difficult economic environment they face, news organizations have shown little stomach for increasing hard news budgets or supporting much in the way of investigative journalism.\n\nInstead, a good deal of what passes for American journalism today is simply information recycled straight from government sources. There are exceptions, of course, as well as newer, non-traditional sources of news and opinion that provide alternative narratives to the mainstream media accounts. Most encouraging, perhaps, are the emerging signs that Trump's election may lead to a reinvigorated sense of duty on the part of journalists, news organizations, and NGOs. Whether these initial responses add up to an effective counterpoint to Trump's bully pulpit, however, remains to be seen.\n\nTrevor Thrall is a senior fellow for the Cato Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans View Political Correctness as a Problem, According to New Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey conducted by More in Common, an international research initiative, has revealed that political correctness (P.C.) is deeply unpopular among the majority of Americans. The survey, which asked respondents questions about race, immigration, sexism, free speech, and other hot-button issues, categorized participants into seven groups: progressive activists, traditional liberals, passive liberals, the apathetic, moderates, traditional conservatives, and devoted conservatives. The two conservative categories constituted 25 percent of the total, while the progressives made up just 8 percent.\n\nThe remaining 66 percent of participants, according to the researchers, form an \"exhausted majority\" whose views are not significantly different from one another, even across racial and gender lines. As The Atlantic's Yascha Mounk wrote in a thought-provoking analysis of the survey, \"Most members of the 'exhausted majority,' and then some, dislike political correctness.\"\n\nThe survey found that 80 percent of the general population view P.C. excess as a problem in the country. Even young people, including 74 percent of those aged 24 to 29 and 79 percent under age 24, expressed discomfort with political correctness. This indicates that the \"woke\" are in the minority across all age groups.\n\nMounk further observed that youth and race are not reliable indicators of support for political correctness. Instead, education level and income are the best predictors: the most highly educated Americans are more likely to think hate speech is a significant issue, but political correctness is not.\n\nIn previous articles for \u2588\u2588\u2588, I have explored the backlash against political correctness and its potential role in Donald Trump's presidential victory. Voters who identified political correctness as a top issue were more likely to be drawn to Trump's candidacy, and expressing frustration with P.C.-run-amok was a strong indicator of a person voting Republican in 2016. Many of the people who were most upset about political correctness may have been predisposed to vote for the Republican candidate, but the survey findings lend credence to the idea that downplaying the concerns of the anti-PC majority could be a misguided campaign strategy for any potential Trump challenger.\n\nMounk warns that the gap between the progressive perception and the reality of public views on this issue could harm the influence of institutions run by the \"woke elite.\" A publication whose editors believe they represent the views of the majority of Americans when they actually speak to a small minority could see its influence wane and its readership decline. Similarly, a political candidate who believes she speaks for half the population when she actually represents the opinions of one-fifth is likely to lose the next election. In a democracy, it is challenging to win fellow citizens over to your side or to build public support to address ongoing injustices when you fundamentally misunderstand how they see the world.",
    " Title: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Critiques President Obama's Handling of Islamic State, Calls for Clearer AUMF\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strongly-worded opinion piece published by Fox News, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has criticized President Barack Obama's approach to the Islamic State terrorist group, stating that the President's handling demonstrates an inability to fulfill the role of Commander-in-Chief.\n\nJindal, who is rumored to be considering a presidential run in 2016, argues that the President's refusal to label the conflict as a war against \"radical Islam\" is a significant oversight. He contends that the President's reluctance to acknowledge the problem of \"radical Islamic terrorism\" prevents him from addressing it effectively.\n\nThe Governor also took issue with recent comments made by Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, who suggested on MSNBC that a lack of job opportunities could be a factor in individuals joining terrorist groups. Jindal described this perspective as \"madness,\" asserting that military action is the key to winning a war.\n\nIn addition, Jindal called for amendments to the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to remove a prohibition on ground troops. He argued that this section of the President's request for AUMF is a political strategy designed to appease the left and is unclear in its mission to defeat the terrorists.\n\nJindal concluded his piece by urging President Obama to tell the American people the truth about \"radical Islam\" and to set aside political considerations in order to defeat the terrorists. He emphasized the need for a clear mission for the military and a commitment to defeating the Islamic State.",
    " Title: White House and IRS Face Oversight Over Email Inquiry Amidst Ongoing Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are facing renewed scrutiny over the sharing of private taxpayer information with President Obama's top aides, as the IRS has reportedly refused to dig into its computers for emails that could shed light on the matter. In a letter last week, the White House's chief counsel, W. Neil Eggleston, assured Congress that the IRS would address the issue, but not until it has completed its ongoing investigations, particularly the tea party-targeting scandal.\n\nIn his letter to House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan, Mr. Eggleston stated that the IRS would address new topics, such as the email inquiry, following the completion of document productions already in progress. However, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen's letter last year did not indicate such a promise. Instead, Mr. Koskinen stated that the IRS was logistically incapable of performing the search due to the need to comb through 90,000 email accounts.\n\nThe White House's stance comes despite its past performance of similar email searches, such as in the case of the IRS's loss of thousands of emails from former division chief Lois G. Lerner, a key figure in the tea party targeting scandal. The House is investigating whether the laws governing taxpayer information security are functioning effectively, which is part of its jurisdiction.\n\nThe IRS has been under fire for several scandals, including the targeting of tea party groups for politically motivated scrutiny and the illegal release of private taxpayer information concerning the National Organization for Marriage. The IRS insisted the disclosure was accidental and not politically motivated, but it did pay a settlement to the organization.\n\nSome outside pressure groups argue that the IRS's improper behavior goes further, including disclosing private taxpayer information to the White House. The groups point to comments by a top White House economic adviser who, in 2010, stated that Koch Industries, the company run by conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, paid no corporate income taxes.\n\nThe IRS's inspector general is currently investigating that issue, but has refused to release documents and is facing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over the matter. Both the House and Senate are now investigating IRS and White House communications as well.\n\nIn the past, the White House did not assert any privileges in refusing Mr. Ryan's request last week, instead insisting the IRS would work on it. This contrasts with Mr. Koskinen's 2014 letter, which made clear he didn't think such a search was feasible from his end. The IRS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.\n\nCongress and the White House faced a similar situation last year after the IRS admitted it had lost some of Ms. Lerner's emails. The Ways and Means Committee then asked the White House if it had any such emails, and Mr. Obama's aides complied with that request, even providing three emails that Congress hadn't asked for.\n\nOfficial requests for private taxpayer information made by the White House are supposed to be personally signed by the president, and the Joint Committee on Taxation is supposed to be notified of the request. The JCT issues an annual report on all requests for IRS information, and those reports don't show any such requests from the president during Mr. Obama's time in office.\n\nMark W. Everson, who was commissioner of the IRS under President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2007, said both sides try to observe a strict division. \"I can't remember this ever having come up\u2014at least it ever having been brought to my attention,\" he said. \"In my experience, the White House and the service were scrupulous about making sure appropriate independence was maintained between the two.\"\n\nMr. Koskinen, the current IRS commissioner, has told Congress he is working in good faith to restore trust in his agency and to cooperate with lawmakers' investigations, which he says have cost millions of dollars in staff time and additional computer capacity. The tax agency has turned over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in the tea party investigation, and congressional committees, including Ways and Means, are trying to finalize their reports on the wrongdoing.",
    " Title: Violence Erupts at Guantanamo Bay as Prisoners Resist Transfer to Individual Cells\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare incident, inmates at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center in Cuba clashed with guards on Saturday after military authorities decided to end communal housing in one of the prison's camps. A detainee was reportedly injured by a rubber bullet during the altercation.\n\nThe violence ensued following the facility's commander's order for the move on Saturday morning. According to the U.S. Southern Command, the decision was made due to detainees covering windows and surveillance cameras, limiting the guards' ability to monitor them continuously.\n\nThe forced transfer was also used as an opportunity to evaluate the health of the prisoners, as many of them are currently on a hunger strike. Some detainees resisted with improvised weapons, according to the official statement, and in response, four less-than-lethal rounds were fired. There were no serious injuries reported among guards or detainees.\n\nThe prisoners' weapons included batons, broomsticks, and plastic water bottles, according to multiple reports. The incident occurred in an area of Guantanamo Bay that had evolved into a \"medium-security\" section since the first inmates were brought there more than 10 years ago.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the guards have been losing control over the inmates. According to The Miami Herald, captives could be seen systematically disobeying communal camp rules. They covered surveillance cameras in individual cells with cereal boxes, and they refused to admit food carts to the cellblocks. Commanders expressed concern that, out of view of the guard force, there were stealth hunger strikers who could suddenly die.\n\nThe exact number of prisoners currently on a hunger strike fluctuates, with some news outlets citing the Pentagon's estimate of 43 prisoners out of a total of 166, while others claim the number is over 60, citing sources within the military and the inmates' defense attorneys.\n\nLast week, the Pentagon named 11 inmates who were being force-fed to prevent them from starving themselves to death. The hunger strike was reportedly prompted by inmates' anger over guards' searching their Qurans and other practices that began after a change in command at the base last summer.",
    " Title: Key Republican Figures Opt Out of 2012 National Convention, Citing Divergent Reasons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, several prominent Republican figures have announced their decision to skip the party's 2012 national convention, citing varying political reasons. The most recent addition to this group is former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman.\n\nHuntsman, a former Utah governor and ambassador to China, announced on Friday that he would not attend the national convention next month, nor any future Republican conventions. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the current state of the Republican Party and called for a shift towards a more inclusive and problem-solving-oriented future.\n\n\"I will not be attending this year's convention, nor any Republican Convention in the future, until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States. A future based on problem-solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit,\" Huntsman said.\n\nThe former Utah governor's decision to skip the convention comes amidst reports of a fallout with party leaders, following his suggestion in January that a third party should enter the presidential race after his own withdrawal. He later compared the GOP to China's communist party for its response.\n\nAnother notable Republican, George Allen, has also announced his decision to stay away from the convention. Allen's campaign stated on Tuesday that the former Virginia senator and governor is too engrossed in his close race with Democrat Tim Kaine for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Jim Webb. The race, which has been too close to call since the candidates' announcements, has seen Allen's opponents attempt to brand him as a Washington insider.\n\nThree other GOP candidates for Senate \u2013 Heather Wilson in New Mexico, Rep. Denny Rehberg in Montana, and Linda McMahon in Connecticut \u2013 have also opted to skip the convention to focus on their respective races.\n\nHuntsman won two delegates for his third-place finish in New Hampshire. He will release these delegates to Mitt Romney, whom he has endorsed. In his announcement, Huntsman reiterated his campaign theme of \"Country First.\"\n\n\"I encourage a return to the party we have been in the past, from Lincoln right on through to Reagan, that was always willing to put our country before politics,\" he said.",
    " Title: Study Warns of Potential Impact of Ocean Acidification on Shark Teeth and Scales\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in Scientific Reports suggests that ocean warming and acidification could pose a significant threat to sharks, potentially displacing them as apex predators and disrupting entire marine food webs. The research, led by Lutz Auerswald, a fisheries biologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa and the nation's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, indicates that increased acidity in the oceans could cause shark teeth and scales to corrode, compromising their ability to swim, hunt, and feed.\n\nThe study's senior author, Auerswald, warns that larger species, such as great white sharks, could be particularly vulnerable due to their already endangered status. The idea for the study emerged from a casual conversation between Auerswald and Sarika Singh, an ocean researcher at South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs, over beers. Recognizing the high acidity of beer and other carbonated beverages' effect on human teeth, Singh wondered about the potential impact of more acidic ocean water on shark teeth.\n\nMost studies on ocean acidification have focused on species that build shells or other calcium-based structures, such as corals and shellfish. Few studies have examined the impact of acidification on sharks, primarily due to their size, difficulty in handling, and endangered status. Only one paper has looked at the effect of pH on shark skin denticles or scales, with no significant impact observed. However, the results of this study may have been limited by the relatively low carbon dioxide concentration used, compared to the high levels already present in many parts of the world's oceans.\n\nFor their study, Auerswald, Singh, and their colleagues focused on puff adder shy sharks, a small, bottom-dwelling South African species of cat shark that is easily handled and not endangered. The team investigated the effects of acidification on the animals' comparatively larger scales, as both shark teeth and scales are made of a calcium phosphate material called dentin.\n\nThe researchers captured puff adder shy sharks in a harbor in Cape Town, South Africa, and transported them to a government research aquarium, where the fish acclimated for four months. They divided 13 of the sharks into control and experimental groups. Control animals remained in an aquarium with a mildly basic pH of 8.1, matching that of the ocean, while the researchers gradually lowered the pH of the experimental animals' water to 7.3, the level that ocean water is predicted to reach by 2300 if carbon dioxide emissions continue. In some areas, including the waters off South Africa and California, the pH can already drop to 7.3 or lower, depending on prevailing currents and winds.\n\nAfter two months, an electron-microscope analysis revealed that the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the sharks' denticles were significantly reduced. About 25 percent of the experimental group's scales were damaged, compared with only 9 percent in the control group. \"If dissolution is already visible [after just two months], one can only speculate how the sharks would look after a year or more,\" says Fredrik Jutfelt, a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, who was not involved in the latest research but co-authored the only other study of shark scales in acidic conditions. \"Increased dissolution of denticles could have serious consequences for sharks for many reasons.\"\n\nThe impacts, however, would likely vary between species. Puff adder shy sharks are sedentary predators that ambush their prey, so corroded scales might not impact their ability to hunt. However, for larger species that swim in open water, such as great white sharks, scales play an important role in hydrodynamics. One study found that shark denticles are responsible for an up to 12 percent increase in swimming speed. Thus, damaged denticles could slow sharks down and make it more difficult for them to catch prey. Scales also protect females from male biting during courtship and help some shark species defend against other predators. Likewise, corrosion to teeth could hit some species harder than others.\n\nOther groups of calcifying organisms, for whom the effects of acidification are more well-studied, show these wide-ranging differences. Auerswald and his colleagues have observed that lobsters are quite resilient in the face of acidification, whereas abalones grow significantly slower, and \"their shells look horrible,\" he says. \"A lot of animals have survived even more acidic conditions in the ancient past, but we also know that a lot of species were wiped out,\" Auerswald says. \"One lesson is that you have to test species by species.\"",
    " Title: Stand Your Ground Laws: A Neutral Analysis of Their Impact on Homicide Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a balanced and evidence-based analysis, McClatchy examines the controversial Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws, a topic that has received significant political attention in recent times. The article acknowledges that the SYG law played a minimal role in the trial of George Zimmerman, as he was either defending himself or not threatened at all, depending on the perspective.\n\nSince Florida enacted its SYG law in 2005, at least 24 states have adopted similar legislation. The general principle of these laws is to eliminate the long-standing legal \"duty to retreat\" in the face of danger while in a public place. Instead, individuals may defend themselves, with lethal force if necessary, so long as they are in the public place legally.\n\nLast year, two Georgia State University economists, Chandler B. McClellan and Erdal Tekin, published a paper with the National Bureau of Economic Research, concluding that these laws are \"associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.\" They estimated that \"between 28 and 33 additional white males are killed each month\" due to these laws.\n\nSimilarly, Mark Hoekstra and Cheng Cheng from Texas A&M found a \"statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders and non-negligent manslaughters\" in states with enhanced self-defense laws.\n\nHowever, the impact of SYG laws on homicide rates varies across states. While Florida saw an increase after passing its law, the trend has not been consistent in other states. For instance, Texas has shown a decline in homicide rates after SYG passage, and other states, such as Delaware, New Mexico, and Louisiana, have either shown slight declines or no change at all.\n\nA chart from McClatchy's interactive tool shows the homicide rates in SYG states, with Washington D.C.'s murder/manslaughter rate, which has some of the strictest gun control regulations in the US, sitting at the top. This suggests that policymakers might want to focus more on addressing high rates of violence in areas with strict gun control, rather than on SYG laws in states that seem to have a better handle on the situation.",
    " Title: Trump and Cruz Meet in Puerto Rico Amidst Ongoing Recovery Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assess the ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Maria, he expressed optimism about the change in tone from one of his most vocal critics, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.\n\n\"Well, I think she's come a long way,\" the president said of Cruz, who previously clashed with Mr. Trump over the federal response. The mayor, who has criticized the federal government for its inefficiency, is scheduled to attend a briefing with the president in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.\n\n\"I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done, and people are looking at that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he departed the White House. \"In Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. And I'll tell you what, I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it's actually a much tougher situation.\"\n\nThe president added, \"But now the roads are cleared, communications is starting to come back. We need their truck drivers to start driving trucks.\"\n\nHurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, struck Puerto Rico on September 20, causing widespread destruction, knocking out power, communication, and transportation systems. Nearly two weeks after the storm made landfall, power is still out for 95 percent of electricity customers, and much of the countryside lacks access to life-sustaining basics, including food and fresh water.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump responded to Cruz's criticism with his own, taking to Twitter to express his displeasure. \"They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,\" he wrote. He also accused the news media, specifically CNN and NBC, of undermining the recovery effort with overly negative reports.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's efforts took a hit on Tuesday from Oxfam, an international organization that fights poverty and rarely criticizes wealthy nations during a crisis. \"Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely, and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US government has mounted in Puerto Rico,\" Oxfam America President Abby Maxman said in a statement. \"Clean water, food, fuel, electricity, and healthcare are in desperately short supply and quickly dwindling, and we're hearing excuses and criticism from the administration instead of a cohesive and compassionate response.\"",
    " Title: Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon Found Dead Amid Criminal Probe and Allegations of Sexual Harassment\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korea's longtime mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, was found dead on Friday after he went missing amid a criminal investigation and allegations of sexual harassment. His body was discovered in wooded hills in northern Seoul late at night, seven hours after police launched a search party.\n\nAccording to police, there were no signs of foul play, and they did not disclose the cause of death. The apparent suicide came after a former secretary filed a complaint on Wednesday, alleging that the 64-year-old mayor had sexually harassed her. Police confirmed a criminal complaint had been made against Park, but they did not elaborate on the nature of the allegations.\n\nIn a note left on his desk and released by the city government with the family's permission, Park expressed remorse and asked to be cremated and his ashes scattered over his parents' grave. A representative for Park's family issued a statement, urging people to avoid spreading \"groundless statements.\"\n\nPark was reported missing by his daughter on Thursday at 5:17 pm, and police said he had left a message \"like a will.\" Park did not come to work on Thursday for unspecified reasons and had canceled all of his schedule, including a meeting with a presidential official at his Seoul City Hall office.\n\nPark was first elected as Seoul mayor in 2011 and was instrumental in the city's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He was a member of President Moon Jae-in's liberal Democratic Party and was considered a potential presidential candidate in the 2022 elections.\n\nPark was a longtime civic activist and human rights lawyer who was credited with winning the country's first sexual harassment conviction in the 1990s. He was also an outspoken critic of Japan's colonial-era policies towards Korea, including the mobilization of Korean and other women as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers.\n\nIn 2018, Park praised women for their courage after a series of women accused powerful politicians and policymakers of sexual wrongdoings amid the #MeToo movement. He established himself as a fierce opponent of former conservative President Park Geun-hye and openly supported the millions of people who flooded the city's streets in late 2016 and 2017 calling for her resignation over a corruption scandal.\n\nThere was an outpouring of grief from his supporters, while reactions to his death were mixed on social media, including both condolences and criticism that he took his own life to avoid punishment. A memorial altar will be set up in front of the city hall for citizens to pay their respects.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Biological Definition of Sex in Title IX Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and debate, the Trump administration is reportedly considering a change in the definition of sex under Title IX, the federal civil-rights statute banning sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The proposed definition would define sex as \"a person's status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.\"\n\nThe proposed change, if implemented, would roll back the Obama administration's 2014 expansion of the definition of sex, which included gender identity. The Obama administration's interpretation, which was not legislated or subjected to a regulatory rulemaking process, had led to aggressive mandates for schools across the nation, requiring the use of chosen pronouns and accommodations for transgender students in bathrooms, locker rooms, overnight accommodations, and even some sports teams.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed definition is a return to the traditional and intended definition of sex, as understood by the men and women who drafted and passed Title IX. The change is being met with resistance from some quarters, with critics arguing that it would \"erase\" the existence of transgender individuals.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the proposed change does not deny the existence or humanity of any individual. Every American, regardless of their gender identity, is still protected by the Bill of Rights and other constitutional rights. The change in regulatory definitions would simply reflect the original intent of the statute, and would not affect the unalienable rights of any individual to raise their voice and, if they persuade a sufficient number of legislators, to change the law.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed change is not a denial of anyone's humanity or existence, but rather a stand against a lawless redefinition of biological reality. The administration is not erasing anyone from the human race, but rather is conforming the law to the truth. The debate surrounding this issue is complex and nuanced, and it is important for all parties to engage in respectful and informed discourse as the issue is further explored and debated.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Debate Erupts Over Supreme Court Expansion as 2020 Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, the debate over the Supreme Court's future composition has intensified, with progressives advocating for expanding the number of justices and conservatives pushing to maintain the status quo.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder, a potential Democratic candidate for the presidency, has suggested that expanding the number of Supreme Court justices could be a viable option if a Democratic president and Congress are willing to pursue such a change. Holder's comments come in response to the controversial move by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to block President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland in 2016, leaving the Supreme Court seat vacant until President Trump's appointment of a more conservative justice.\n\nTwo Democratic presidential hopefuls, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, have voiced support for the plan to expand the Supreme Court. However, Republicans are prepared to fight back. Representative Mark Green (R-TN) has announced plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to limit the number of Supreme Court justices to nine, the number of seats since 1869.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has also weighed in on the issue, expressing concern over the growing support for court packing among Democratic candidates. In a Fox News op-ed, Rubio argued that court packing is a dangerous scheme that could destabilize the judiciary and undermine the Founders' vision of an independent judiciary that serves as a check on the Executive and Legislative branches.\n\nRubio has vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment to keep the number of seats at nine, emphasizing the importance of preserving the Supreme Court's impartiality and preventing further destabilization of essential institutions. The Supreme Court's recent decision to grant the Department of Homeland Security legal authority to detain illegal immigrants after a court hearing has added fuel to the fire, with progressives expressing concern over the court's conservative leanings.\n\nAs the 2020 election nears, the debate over the Supreme Court's future composition is likely to remain a contentious issue, with both parties vying for control of the nation's highest court. The outcome of this debate could have far-reaching implications for the balance of power in the United States government and the direction of the country for years to come.",
    " Title: Clinton Launches National Voter Registration Drive for \"Dreamers\" Ahead of 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has announced a new voter registration drive aimed at registering undocumented immigrants, commonly known as \"Dreamers,\" in a bid to mobilize sympathetic voters ahead of the 2016 election. The program, titled \"Mi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,\" was unveiled on Sunday, marking the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children from deportation.\n\nThe 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are ineligible to vote. However, they remain a significant political force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to leverage their influence to encourage Latino and other households to vote for the Democratic nominee. Organizers will remind voters that a Trump presidency could potentially end the Dreamer program, which is currently at risk following a June Supreme Court ruling that effectively halted Obama's efforts to grant legal status to some of the 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe program is part of an aggressive effort by Clinton's campaign to engage the record 27.3 million Latinos eligible to vote in 2016. Polling shows Trump performing poorly with Latino voters compared to any GOP presidential candidate since 1996. The new effort will focus on battleground states such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida, where Latinos and other immigrants make up a significant portion of the voting base.\n\nThough Obama's campaign had no formal organization program for Dreamers, door-knocking by these young immigrants, who have lived and attended school in the U.S., helped mobilize many Latino voters who were eligible to vote. Clinton aims to harness their power in a more formal way, particularly given her opponent's immigration rhetoric, which has sparked outrage and fear within the Latino community.\n\nTrump has promised to revoke Obama's executive orders within the first 100 days of his presidency, calling them the \"most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president.\" Clinton, on the other hand, has made revamping the country's immigration system a key plank of her presidential campaign. She has pledged to introduce legislation during her first 100 days in office, restore and expand Obama's programs, close private sector detention centers, and \"take a very hard look at the deportation policies\" currently in force.\n\nLast month, Clinton called on Latino voters to help stop what she called Trump's efforts to \"fan the flames of racial division.\" The following is the full Clinton campaign statement on the latest program, per The Washington Examiner:\n\n\"On DACA's Four-Year Anniversary, Hillary for America Launches National Voter Registration Program, 'Mi Sueno, Tu Voto'\"\n\nOn the four-year anniversary tomorrow when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) enrollment began, Hillary for America is launching a national voter registration program, \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" (My Dream, Your Vote), to organize Dreamers to mobilize their communities and ask voters to consider what is at stake for their families in November. \"Dreamers have played a pivotal role in our campaign, advocating for families who constantly live in fear of deportation\u2014so we've created a program that aims to turn these stories into action,\" said Lorella Praeli, National Director of the Latino Vote.\n\nThe program calls on Dreamers across the country to join the campaign's grassroots efforts to secure commitments from their community to vote for their future in November. \"We founded this program on the premise that, one by one\u2014through friends, families, co-workers, or classmates\u2014Dreamers' futures would be considered on Election day,\" stated Praeli. \"We may not have the right to vote, but 'Mi Sueno, Tu Voto' will help ensure that our stories are heard and it will send a clear signal to Donald Trump that we can not be silenced,\" said Astrid Silva, Nevada DREAMer and immigrant rights activist.\n\nHillary for America will be holding events across the country this week, including in Florida, Nevada, and North Carolina, to unveil the program. \"Mi Sueno, Tu Voto\" will also serve to remind voters of Trump's hateful and dangerous agenda, highlighting his pledge to eliminate DACA and deport millions of Dreamers and immigrant families.",

Four accounts were compromised, but none were associated with the US presidential campaign or current and former US government officials.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and has taken legal and technical steps to combat these attacks. The company has notified the affected customers and worked to secure their compromised accounts.\n\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a significant concern for governments, following US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia disrupted the American democratic process in 2016 to potentially aid Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nMicrosoft's Digital Crimes Unit recommends that all customers enable two-step verification and periodically check their login history to help secure their accounts. The company also noted that the attacks were not technically sophisticated but attempted to use a significant amount of personal information to identify and attack their intended targets. This suggests that Phosphorus is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources in information gathering.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Congressional Agreement on Russia Sanctions Bill Limits Trump's Ability to Lift Sanctions\n\nThe United States Congress has reached a bipartisan agreement on legislation that imposes fresh sanctions on Russia for alleged election meddling and restricts President Donald Trump's ability to lift any existing sanctions against the Kremlin.\n\nThe new bill, which has already passed the Senate and is due for a vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, would make it difficult for President Trump to alter sanctions or return diplomatic properties without the approval of Congress. The legislation also covers potential future sanctions against Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe agreement, reached after \"intense negotiations,\" indicates a firm stance by Congress against Russia, despite President Trump's previous suggestions of diplomatic leeway with the Kremlin. The bill allows for new sanctions against Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea as well as for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US election.\n\nSenator Ben Cardin, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, \"A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the House and the Senate would act on the legislation \"promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.\" He described a strong sanctions bill as \"essential.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump hinted he would consider recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and suggested lifting sanctions. In another development, Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, has returned home after ending his nine-year tenure. Mr. Kislyak has been linked to several of President Trump's associates and has been named by US media as a key figure in the investigation into alleged election interference.\n\nUS authorities continue to investigate possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia, claims Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied. In a new twist on Saturday, reports emerged that Mr. Trump was considering presidential pardons for family members, aides, and even himself.\n\nPresidents have the power to pardon people before guilt is established or even before the person is charged with a crime. In response to the reports, Mr. Trump tweeted, \"While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS.\"\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, described the reports as disturbing, adding, \"Pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line.\"",
    " Title: Michael Cohen's Interview: A Shift in Loyalty and Allegations Against President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former attorney, has alleged that Trump directed him to make the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, and that he was aware these payments were wrong. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Cohen stated, \"Of course [he knew it was wrong]. He was very concerned about how this would affect the election.\"\n\nCohen, who was once known for his unwavering loyalty to Trump, claimed that Trump's involvement extended beyond the hush payments, stating, \"Nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump. He directed me to make the payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.\"\n\nCohen's assertions, which follow his August plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, have raised concerns about Trump's legal liability due to Cohen's cooperation. In November, Cohen admitted to lying to Congress about the nature and timing of Trump's business dealings with Russia.\n\nThe allegations have sparked discussions about Trump's potential impeachment and indictment, a situation that seems to have unsettled the president, who has spent months criticizing his \"weak\" former attorney. In his latest attack, Trump accused Cohen of lying to \"embarrass the president\" and secure a reduced prison sentence.\n\nHowever, Cohen denied any intention to humiliate Trump, stating that Mueller has a \"substantial amount of information\" to corroborate his assertions about the hush agreements and the Russia dealings.\n\nIn response to these allegations, Trump's legal team has adjusted its defense. Initially, Trump claimed he had \"NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA,\" but this week, he described his dealings with the Kremlin as \"peanut stuff\" that was \"very legal & very cool.\" After long denying any knowledge of the hush payments, this week Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Daily Beast that \"Nobody got killed, nobody got robbed... This was not a big crime.\"\n\nThis development marks a significant shift in the ongoing legal saga surrounding President Trump and his associates. The full extent of the impact of Cohen's allegations remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Vice President Mike Pence Visits Mayo Clinic Without Mask, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to the Mayo Clinic on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence was seen without a mask, despite the renowned medical facility's requirement for all visitors, patients, and staff to wear face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe pool image from the Vice President's visit to the Mayo Clinic Rochester Facilities on April 28, 2020, shows Pence surrounded by nine other people, including a patient, all wearing masks.\n\nPence, who leads President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, later explained to reporters that he did not need to wear a mask because he is tested regularly for the virus and does not have it.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic, located in Rochester, Minnesota, has a policy mandating masks for everyone on its premises as part of its protocol \"for ensuring your safety.\" The facility informed Pence of its mask requirement before his tour.\n\nA half-hour after the Mayo Clinic's tweet about the mask policy was posted, it was deleted. Video footage shows people wearing masks greeting Pence at the airport, but the vice president was not wearing a mask upon his arrival at the Mayo Clinic or during his discussion with top doctors, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn.\n\nPence's aides last week told The New York Times that he did not wear a mask for the same reasons he gave Tuesday. However, the newspaper noted that Pence could contract the virus between his tests, and that the tests are not always accurate.\n\nIn a news conference at the facility after the tour and discussion, Pence was asked about his decision not to wear a mask. He responded that he is tested for the coronavirus regularly and that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines about wearing masks recognize that people who may have the virus can prevent the possibility of spreading it to others by wearing a mask.\n\nPence added that since he does not have the coronavirus, he wanted to thank the researchers and healthcare personnel at the Mayo Clinic in person.\n\nWhen asked about the frequency of his testing and whether wearing a mask might send a positive signal to the American public, Pence did not directly answer the question. However, he reiterated that he is tested \"on a regular basis.\"\n\nA Mayo Clinic spokesman, when asked for comment, said in an email that the clinic shared its masking policy with Pence's office. The spokesman did not respond to the question about why the facility deleted its tweet about Pence.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic later posted a new tweet expressing its gratitude for Pence's visit. The tally of Americans diagnosed with coronavirus infections topped 1 million on the same day that Pence visited the Mayo Clinic, and at least 57,266 Americans have died from Covid-19.",
    " Title: The Imperative of Mandatory E-Verify for New Hires in Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing discourse on immigration policy, a crucial focus should be on enforcing existing immigration laws to establish a robust and effective immigration system. The coexistence of a substantial number of illegal immigrants, coupled with an unofficial tolerance for this issue, contradicts this objective.\n\nWhile the construction of a border wall or the apprehension of illegal border crossers, with or without families, may garner headlines, it is essential to recognize that approximately four out of every ten illegal immigrants did not enter the country illegally. Instead, they arrived legally and overstayed their visas.\n\nTo address and curb illegal immigration, the most significant step is to prevent illegal immigrants from securing gainful employment, regardless of their entry method. This can be achieved by making it compulsory and feasible for employers to verify the legal status of their new hires through the Electronic Employment Verification (E-Verify) system. The primary driver of illegal immigration is not crime or political instability, but rather the prospect of economic advancement.\n\nBy implementing E-Verify, we can control and reduce illegal immigration, not just at the border, but across the nation. Removing the economic incentive will serve as a humane deterrent against future illegal immigration. Additionally, mandatory E-Verify will make it more challenging for existing illegal immigrants to switch jobs, leading some to leave voluntarily.\n\nMoreover, the mandatory implementation of E-Verify will facilitate the prosecution of employers who exploit illegal workers and suppress wages for lower-income Americans. The Trump administration has been hesitant to prioritize E-Verify, but its implementation would serve as a deterrent and help reduce the illegal population without the need for direct removal.\n\nAs the House prepares to vote on immigration this week, it is crucial for conservatives to advocate for the inclusion of E-Verify in any proposed legislation. The current bill, while containing several commendable provisions, does not mandate the use of E-Verify for new hires. By insisting on this requirement, we can take a significant step towards a more effective and humane immigration policy.",
    " Title: President Trump Condemns Racism and White Supremacy, Calls for Cultural Change Following Mass Shootings\n\nIn a series of remarks on Monday, President Donald Trump addressed the nation following the weekend's mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The President, speaking from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, expressed his condolences and condemned the acts of violence as \"barbaric slaughters\" that are an \"assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity.\"\n\nTrump stated that the shooter in El Paso had posted a manifesto online, consumed by racist hate, and that the shooter in Dayton had carried out the shooting just hours later. The President called for the nation to \"condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy\" and for these \"sinister ideologies\" to be defeated.\n\nWhile not proposing any major gun control legislation, the President suggested the need to strengthen mental health laws. He stated, \"Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.\" The President also directed the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty.\n\nTrump called for a \"cultural change\" in society, stating, \"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grizzly video games that are now commonplace.\" The President's remarks were carried live by television networks, but it was not a formal speech to the nation.\n\nThe President did not repeat his suggestion about gun background checks that he tweeted about earlier Monday. In those tweets, Trump proposed \"strong background checks,\" perhaps tied to immigration reform. The President also blamed the news media for \"the anger and rage that has built up over many years.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama weighed in with a rare tweet that, while not mentioning Trump by name, reflected scathing criticism of divisive rhetoric. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has demanded that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell call the Senate back from its August recess to consider the bipartisan, House-passed universal background checks bill.\n\nIt was unclear how either of the shootings were related to immigration reform, as Trump suggested. The National Rifle Association applauded Trump's call to address the root causes of violence. The President's acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, rejected claims from Democratic candidates and others that the President's harsh rhetoric on immigration played any role in the shootings.",
    " Title: The Economist Takes a Moderate Approach on Climate Change: Assessing the Flatlining Surface Temperatures and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nIn a recent article, The Economist has taken a more measured stance on climate change, acknowledging the ongoing increase in greenhouse gas emissions while highlighting the lack of significant surface temperature rise over the past 15 years. The piece, penned by the British publication, delves into various studies suggesting that the Earth's sensitivity to changes in carbon dioxide levels may not be as extreme as previously believed.\n\nJames Hansen, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, notes that the five-year mean global temperature has remained flat for a decade, despite the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Ed Hawkins, a researcher from the University of Reading in Britain, points out that surface temperatures since 2005 are already at the low end of the range of projections derived from 20 climate models. If temperatures remain flat, they will fall outside the models' range within a few years.\n\nThe article suggests that if temperatures are likely to rise by only 2\u00b0C in response to a doubling of carbon emissions, and if the likelihood of a 6\u00b0C increase is trivial, the focus might shift from mitigation to adaptation. The analogy used is that of earthquake insurance, suggesting that it is unnecessary to halt economic growth if one does not live in an earthquake zone. Instead, more adaptation rather than more mitigation might be the right policy at the margin.\n\nThe article does not dismiss the reality of climate change but questions the notion that humanity's economic activities are directly causing an imminent, irreversible catastrophe. The piece argues that the world should seek to adapt to the greenhouse-gas splurge rather than attempting to stop it. The article also suggests that a more honest, less emotional approach to the science, the range of possibilities, and the unknown aspects of climate change might be more effective in recruiting people to the cause in the long run.\n\nThe article's approach is a departure from the publication's usual climate-alarmist tone, signaling a shift in the narrative on climate change. While the article acknowledges the need to address environmental problems, it questions the urgency and the extent to which human activities are driving climate change. The piece is a call for a more measured, fact-based discussion on climate change, rather than relying on hysterical doomsaying to drive action.",
    " Title: Couple Defends Actions as Protesters Dispute Account of Gun Incident in St. Louis\n\nA white couple who were seen in a viral video over the weekend brandishing guns at protesters outside their home in St. Louis have defended their actions, stating they were in fear for their lives. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, in an interview with local CBS affiliate KMOV, claimed they pointed their guns at the protesters outside their residence on Sunday due to their apprehension.\n\nThe protesters were reportedly on their way to the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson (D) to demand her resignation, following her recent livestream in which she read activists' personal information. The group, numbering several hundred, had been walking through Portland Place, a gated community, when they approached the McCloskeys' home on Sunday night.\n\nMark McCloskey told KMOV that they felt threatened, stating, \"It was like the storming of the Bastille, the gate came down and a large crowd of angry, aggressive people poured through. I was terrified that we\u2019d be murdered within seconds. Our house would be burned down, our pets would be killed.\"\n\nHe also shared a picture with the station of a gate to the community that had been damaged, but the paper noted it has not been confirmed whether the gate was damaged by the protesters. Rasheen Aldridge, who was reportedly one of the leaders of the protest, disputed the couple's claims, stating the protest remained peaceful in nature despite the McCloskeys drawing guns on the demonstrators.\n\nIn a statement to KMOV, attorney Albert Watkins, who represents the McCloskeys, defended their actions, stating they were not \"race related.\" He added, \"In fact, the agitators responsible for the trepidation were white.\"\n\nWatkins continued, \"The Black Lives Matters movement is here to stay, it is the right message, and it is about time. The McCloskeys want to make sure no one thinks less of BLM, its message and the means it is employing to get its message out because of the actions of a few white individuals who tarnished a peaceful protest.\"\n\nHe reportedly added that the McCloskeys are lawyers whose professional careers have been marked by their long-standing commitment to protecting the civil rights of clients victimized at the hands of law enforcement. This commitment, he said, continues today in the Isaiah Forman case.",
    " Title: U.S. House Democrats Pass \"For The People Act\" Amidst Partisan Divide and Controversial Voting Rights Provisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly partisan vote on Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the \"For The People Act\" or \"H.R.1,\" a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights bill. The legislation, which passed 234-193 along party lines, aims to make voting easier, strengthen ethics rules, and reject a motion to condemn voting by undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe 700-page bill, if enacted, would designate Election Day as a federal holiday, require all states to offer automatic voter registration, restore voting rights to convicted felons, institute independent redistricting commissions to combat gerrymandering, and require nonprofit organizations to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000 to rein in dark-money groups.\n\nU.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation, described it as a \"power grab for the American people.\" In contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) stated that the bill would \"undermine the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicating he will not bring the bill for a vote, effectively killing the bill. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis (R), the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee on elections, argued that the bill is a \"bill that is for loading billions of billions of dollars into the coffers of members of Congress.\"\n\nIn a related development, the House also voted to defend localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. The vote, which would have little practical effect as non-citizens are barred from participating in federal elections, would have added language to \"H.R.1 stating that \"allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.\"\n\nSix Democrats and one Republican opposed the measure, with Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, advocating for open political processes and referencing San Francisco's policy of allowing non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, to vote in school board elections.",
    " Title: White House Cancels Philadelphia Eagles' Visit Amid Controversy Over National Anthem Misrepresentation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Trump canceled the White House visit for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles on Monday, citing the team's alleged disrespect for the National Anthem. However, this explanation has been met with skepticism, as no Eagles players ever stayed in the locker room during the national anthem, nor did any players kneel during the regular season or the playoffs.\n\nThe controversy escalated when Fox News, in a segment on the White House visit cancellation, used footage of Eagles players seemingly protesting during the national anthem. However, it was later revealed that the players in the footage were praying, not protesting. Many Eagles players are Christians, and a group of players pray together before every game.\n\nIn response, Zach Ertz, a tight end for the Eagles, tweeted that Fox News should be \"better than this.\" Ertz is among the players featured praying in the Fox News segment. This incident led to an apology from Fox News, acknowledging that no Eagles players ever kneeled in protest during the 2017 season.\n\nThe White House, in a statement, said, \"The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\"\n\nHowever, this statement was not accurate, as no Eagles players kneeled during the season, nor did any stay in the locker room. In response to the controversy, Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Ryan Costello tweeted that Trump handled the situation \"poorly.\" Conservative magazine columnist Jonah Goldberg called Trump's statements \"deceitful propaganda,\" and RedState contributor Jim Jamitis pointed out the bad optics of excitedly planning a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while denigrating NFL players.\n\nIn an email, a White House spokesperson asked that I include their updated statement in this article. In the statement, the White House alleges that the Philadelphia Eagles \"decided to abandon their fans\" by not attending the White House celebration. The controversy has led to a reevaluation of the President's handling of the situation, with many questioning the accuracy of his statements and the motives behind the cancellation of the visit.",
    " Title: The Role of Opposition and the Current Political Climate in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the role of opposition is a fundamental aspect of a democratic republic. However, the recent political climate has seen a shift in the dynamics of opposition, with the Democratic Party seemingly struggling to adapt to the new administration.\n\nFor over a decade, the Democrats have held significant power, with control of Congress, the White House, and a majority of state legislatures. The election of Donald Trump, however, has brought about a shift, ushering in unified Republican government. Yet, the Democrats seem to be grappling with this change, as they continue to operate as if they are still in the driver's seat.\n\nThe Democratic leadership's response to Trump's presidency has been met with criticism. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's speech to the 115th House of Representatives was seen as a repetition of the same liberal agenda that has contributed to the current state of the Democratic Party. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's pledge to oppose Trump's nominee weeks before inauguration day, and his subsequent threat to keep the seat held by the late Antonin Scalia empty, has been particularly contentious.\n\nThe Democrats' strategy of filibustering the Scalia replacement could potentially lead to a change in the rules, allowing Supreme Court vacancies to be approved by a majority vote. This could leave the Democrats vulnerable should another vacancy arise in the next two years.\n\nThe opposition to President-elect Trump extends to his appointments at large. The Democrats' insistence on prolonging the confirmation process, citing a lack of personal disclosure by cabinet nominees, has been met with skepticism.\n\nIn every incoming administration, there is a personal revelation or atrocious hearing that dooms a cabinet appointment. However, the quality of the opposition research against Trump's picks has been remarkably blah.\n\nThe first duty of the opposition is to oppose. Yet, the Democrats' hysterics and obnoxious behavior towards the new president have raised eyebrows. The party seems to be struggling to find their footing in this new political climate, with some questionable decisions, such as standing beside a sign that reads, \"Make America Sick Again.\"\n\nThe Democrats may be counting on inertia and the media to slow the Republicans down. However, President Trump does not play defense. It remains to be seen how the Democrats will navigate this new political landscape.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Receives Advance Warning of Iranian Ballistic Missile Attack, Officials Confirm\n\nThe United States military received advance warning of an Iranian ballistic missile attack on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces, according to Pentagon officials. The attack, which occurred Tuesday night, was intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment, and kill personnel, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"In my estimation from what I know now, I think it has more to do with the defensive techniques that our forces used as opposed to intent,\" Milley said, adding that U.S. forces \"took sufficient defensive measures.\"\n\nThe attack involved 16 short-range ballistic missiles, 15 of which were fired from three locations inside Iran during the early hours of Wednesday local time. The missiles were intended as a response to the death of Iranian Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S.-led drone strike at Baghdad International Airport last week.\n\nBetween 1,000- to 2,000-pound warheads were sitting on top of the Iranian missiles fired into Iraq, according to Milley. The defense secretary, Esper, also confirmed that the missiles hit two military bases - the Al-Assad Air Base and a separate military base in Erbil, which house U.S. forces in Iraq. Eleven of those missiles hit Al-Assad, and one hit Erbil. Four of the missiles malfunctioned and failed to hit their target.\n\nThe damage at the bases was largely contained to \"tentage, taxiways, the parking lot, damaged helicopter, things like that, nothing I would describe as major,\" Esper said.\n\nPentagon officials met with President Trump twice in the past 24 hours following the attack, Esper said. Trump announced earlier Wednesday in a nine-minute address to the nation that he would be imposing even more sanctions on Iran in response to the attack.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill have criticized Trump's initial decision to take out Soleimani without first consulting Congress or allies in the region, which has led to escalating tensions in the Middle East. They have since demanded answers from the administration about the alleged imminent threat that sparked the Soleimani attack, and how Trump will de-escalate the tensions with Iran and keep Americans safe.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans for the House to vote Thursday on a War Powers Resolution that aims to limit Trump's military action toward Iran. \"Democrats have serious, urgent concerns about the administration\u2019s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward,\" Pelosi said.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns coming out of Wednesday's Iran briefing about the administration bypassing Congress's approval for military escalations. \"Most members of Congress do not have access to the intelligence that I think is the most compelling. That\u2019s simply the nature of the intelligence and it\u2019s restricted to the Gang of 8,\" Esper said, referring to the bipartisan group of eight lawmakers who are briefed on classified intelligence matters.",
    " Title: U.S. Urges Diplomatic Resolution in Ongoing Diplomatic Row Between Saudi Arabia and Canada\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to de-escalate a growing diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Canada, the U.S. State Department has called for both nations to resolve their differences amicably, focusing on a human rights dispute that has escalated over the past few days.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert emphasized the need for diplomatic resolution, stating that Riyadh and Ottawa should address their issues together. The diplomatic spat began on Sunday when Saudi Arabia expelled the Canadian ambassador from Riyadh and froze all new trade deals between the two countries, following Canada's demand for the release of women's rights activists and others detained in the Kingdom.\n\nCritics argue that Saudi Arabia is attempting to assert its international influence and has overreacted to a tweet from Canada's leading foreign affairs agency, Global Affairs Canada, expressing concern over the detention of Samar Badawi, the sister of a blogger imprisoned by Saudi authorities. The tweet called for the immediate release of Badawi and all other peaceful human rights activists.\n\nDespite Saudi Arabia's threats of harsh trade penalties, the Canadians have remained firm in their stance. The trade relationship between the two countries primarily consists of Saudi exports of petrochemicals, plastics, and other products, with significant military contracts, such as the $13 billion contract won by the Canadian unit of U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp in 2014 for building light-armored vehicles for Saudi Arabia.\n\nMs. Nauert stated that the U.S. is aware of human rights concerns regarding Saudi Arabia but has avoided taking a firm position on the Canada-Saudi spat. She noted that the U.S. maintains a regular dialogue with the Saudi government on human rights and other issues, and encourages the Saudi government to address due process and publicize information on legal cases.\n\nRegarding the specific case between Canada and Saudi Arabia, Ms. Nauert stated that the U.S. has raised its concerns with the Saudi government. The U.S., she added, respects international recognized freedoms and individual liberty, a stance that has not changed. Ms. Nauert concluded by urging both governments to work out their issues together.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Urge Congress to Delay Looming Spending Cuts, According to New Poll\n\nA new survey conducted by Selzer & Co. and released by Bloomberg News on Thursday indicates that a majority of Americans want Congress to delay the impending forced spending cuts, known as the sequester, from taking effect next week. The poll shows that 54% of Americans prefer Congress to postpone the cuts, while 40% support allowing the cuts to proceed.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts, totaling $85 billion over the next seven months and $1.2 trillion over the next decade, would significantly impact federal agencies' spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could reduce economic growth by at least 0.6 percentage points and result in a loss of 750,000 jobs.\n\nThe potential consequences of the spending cuts could be felt in various aspects of American life. Unemployment benefits may weaken, airport security lines could lengthen, federal agencies may face furloughs, national parks could experience delays or closures, and food prices could increase due to cuts to food safety programs.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and lawmakers on Capitol Hill now have until March 1 to reach a deal to avoid the sequester, as the cuts were initially scheduled to take place at the beginning of the year but were postponed for two months due to a scaled-back fiscal cliff bill.\n\nThe poll also reveals that should Washington find a deficit-reduction agreement to replace the automatic cuts, 59% of Americans support White House proposals that call for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. However, a majority of those polled also expressed support for overhauling Social Security and Medicare to reduce the deficit, a position shared by Congressional Republicans.\n\nThe poll's findings align with a Pew Research and USA Today poll released earlier on Thursday, in which 49% said the cuts should be delayed and 40% wanted the cuts to go into effect. Despite the divided opinions, a majority of Americans also expressed a desire to address the federal deficit this year.\n\nThe Bloomberg News survey was conducted February 15-18 with 1,003 U.S. adults by telephone. The poll's sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

That's not what you do. There's no room for violence. There's no place for shouting. There's no room for a politics that fails to at least listen to the other side\u2014even if you vehemently disagree.\"\n\nThe president emphasized the importance of maintaining the principles of American democracy and avoiding the \"bad habits\" that he believes are currently prevalent in the Republican party. \"I believe if you've got the better argument, then you don't need to do that [engage in violence],\" Mr. Obama said. \"Just go out there and organize and persuade.\"\n\nWhile urging Democrats to remain peaceful, Mr. Obama also criticized Mr. Trump and the Republican party for their divisive tactics, stating that their message is not primarily economic but rather one that feeds resentments. \"Being able to say that it's immigrants or it's gays or it's somebody that is taking something away from you\u2014that's the essence of the message that the Republican nominee is delivering,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe president also acknowledged the media's role in the current political climate, stating that celebrity and fame are significant drivers in the culture and that everything is contested.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Obama expressed support for Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance at the event. She is currently facing a primary challenge in her congressional district from Timothy Canova, who is running on a platform of Wall Street reform and has the backing of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\"She's had my back, I want to make sure we have her back,\" Mr. Obama said.",

Bush, who passed away on Friday at the age of 94. The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market will be closed on Wednesday, and will observe a moment of silence on Monday.\n\nThe former president's body will be flown to Washington on Monday. A short service will take place at the U.S. Capitol, followed by his body lying in state in the rotunda from 7:30 p.m. Monday to 8:45 a.m. Wednesday. A state funeral will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Washington National Cathedral, after which his body will be flown to Houston.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Bush's body will lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, and will be interred at the George Bush Presidential Library & Museum at Texas A&M University on Thursday following a private funeral service.\n\nTributes poured in from political dignitaries in the U.S. and around the world, praising Bush's service and character. Bush served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, during the end of the Cold War and the first Persian Gulf War.\n\nThe funeral could affect plans for a spending bill, as Congressional leaders have been discussing the possibility of a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown when seven spending bills expire next weekend. The former president will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol from Monday until Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) are expected to meet with President Trump at the White House, where spending negotiations are likely to come up.\n\nPresident Trump, at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, canceled a news conference scheduled for Saturday, citing Bush's death. Former President Barack Obama, who succeeded Bush in the White House, praised him for his service and contributions to the country.\n\nBush was the last American president to serve in World War II, and went on to work in the oil industry before serving as a congressman, an envoy to the United Nations and China, and head of the Central Intelligence Agency, before becoming Vice President and then President.\n\nThe funeral arrangements and tributes to Bush reflect the profound impact he had on the world during his lifetime, and the enduring legacy he leaves behind.",
    " Title: Egypt Designates Muslim Brotherhood as Terrorist Organization, Escalating Crackdown on Group\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Egypt's government has officially designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, a decision that could further deepen the powerhouse political group's underground existence and potentially escalate violence in the country. The designation comes in the wake of a series of attacks, including a bus bombing in Cairo and a police compound bombing in the Nile Delta, which have raised concerns about the nation's security and political stability.\n\nOn Tuesday, a public bus was bombed in the Cairo district of Nasr City, marking the first instance of a civilian target being hit since the July military takeover of the government. The bombing followed a deadly attack on a police compound in Mansoura two days prior, which resulted in 16 deaths, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe bus bombing, for which no group has claimed responsibility yet, has been followed by the discovery of another bomb nearby, as reported by Egyptian state TV. Tuesday's attack in Mansoura was claimed by Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, a militant group based in the Sinai Peninsula that has been gradually escalating its campaign against the state.\n\nThe group, which has been linked to Al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in urban areas, including the attempted assassination of the interior minister in October. There have been over 260 attacks in the Sinai Peninsula since the military takeover, according to reports.\n\nWhile various militant groups have claimed responsibility for most of the attacks since July, and the Brotherhood has repeatedly denied involvement, the government contends that the Brotherhood is a national security threat, working with militant groups to organize the campaign of violence, though it has provided no evidence.\n\nThe designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization follows months of branding its members and supporters as \"terrorists\" by the government. The organization, which polled ahead of other parties in Egypt's first free parliamentary elections held in 2012, has been besieged since July, with its top leaders either imprisoned or driven underground. In September, the group was formally outlawed.\n\nThousands of members and supporters have been imprisoned, and hundreds have been killed, according to The New York Times. The terrorist designation is a blow, even by those standards, and signals the government's determination to cut off any air to the 80-year-old Islamist organization.\n\nAnalysts warn that the government's move could set Egypt on a path toward \"civil conflict.\" Khalil al-Anani, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington who studies the Brotherhood, told The New York Times, \"This is a big miscalculation from the government. It is a massive social movement, whose supporters might retaliate or fight back.\"\n\nExiled leader of the movement, Ibrahim Munir, told Agence France-Presse from London that protests would continue, calling the designation \"illegitimate.\" Reuters sounds the alarm in an analysis piece surveying Egypt's political landscape, raising concerns about the potential for further violence and instability in the wake of the government's decision.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Overcome Filibuster to Pass Debt Limit Extension Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the Senate Republican party managed to pass a House-passed bill to extend the debt limit unconditionally through 2014, overcoming a filibuster on Wednesday evening with weeks to spare before the deadline. However, the process was not without its challenges, as a collective action problem among Senate Republicans nearly stalled the bill's progress.\n\nFor a brief period, the bill hung in limbo on the Senate floor with 58 votes - 55 from Democrats and three from Republicans - two votes short of the 60 required to break a filibuster and no GOP volunteers forthcoming. The situation was particularly precarious due to the fact that Senate Republicans did not want to vote down the debt limit increase and face the ensuing market panic, but as individuals, none of them wanted their names associated with its passage.\n\nIn a crucial moment, Republican leaders Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, cast their votes to break the filibuster almost simultaneously. This move cleared the threshold, and seven more Republicans joined them. Each of these team players seemed willing to provide cover for their colleagues, but not if the leaders intended to leave them stranded after having initiated the fight in the first place.\n\nAfter the bill's passage, the non-Cruz wing of the party expressed its gratitude to McConnell (whose race is more competitive than Cornyn's) for acting with courage and integrity. However, they were unable to acknowledge that McConnell and Cornyn had invited this situation upon themselves.\n\nFor three years, McConnell has characterized every debt limit increase as a favor President Obama has requested of Congress, a normatively bad thing that Republicans would not agree to without some kind of equally partisan quid pro quo. And every time he's revealed he was bluffing, in 2011, twice in 2013, and again on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2011 debt limit deal still lingers as a catastrophe, but McConnell's actions have left him without a plausible explanation for his mounting defeats. By treating what he knows to be a must-pass measure as a recurring source of leverage for Republicans, he has fostered an expectation among conservative voters that the debt limit would not be increased without concessions from Democrats. That Republicans would never honor an Obama \"request\" like this without pocketing something significant in return.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declined to comment on whether McConnell should keep his leadership role in the next Congress, citing the decision as one for the voters of Kentucky to make. In the aftermath, several of the Republicans who helped the debt limit bill clear the filibuster issued press releases boasting of their votes against final passage, a disingenuous distinction that will not fly with conservative voters.\n\nAs the situation unfolded, it became clear that the strategy that paid off so big in 2011 would not work ever again. The best they can do is to pretend that accepting defeat after a huge bluff is some kind of profile in courage.",
    " Title: Sylvia Burwell Faces Senate Confirmation Hearings Amidst Ongoing Obamacare Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nSylvia Burwell, President Obama's nominee to replace Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services, will face tough questions today from members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Burwell, who currently serves as the White House Budget Director, is expected to be confirmed, but will likely be pressed to address the ongoing issues with Obamacare and propose solutions for improvement.\n\nDuring his announcement of Burwell's nomination last month, President Obama praised her as a \"proven manager\" who is capable of delivering results in the face of \"tough tasks and big challenges.\" With Democrats and the administration acknowledging the need to address problems within Obamacare rather than repealing the legislation, today's hearings will provide an opportunity for Republicans to question Burwell about her plans for fixing the program.\n\nRecent reports have revealed that many of the eight million enrollees in Obamacare are duplicates, and only 67 percent of enrollees have paid their first premium. Burwell will be expected to address these issues and explain her strategy for working with Congress to implement changes. The confirmation hearings also provide a platform for Republicans to scrutinize the program and ask detailed questions about administration claims.\n\nUpon her nomination, Burwell expressed her excitement for the opportunity to build on the achievements of the Affordable Care Act and other initiatives. \"I am humbled, honored, and excited by the opportunity to build on the achievements that Kathleen, the President, and so many others have put in place,\" she said. \"If confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to carrying on the important work of ensuring that children, families, and seniors have the building blocks of healthy and productive lives, whether it's through implementing the Affordable Care Act, supporting affordable childcare, or finding new frontiers to prevent and treat disease.\"\n\nThe confirmation hearings will provide insight into Burwell's approach to addressing the challenges facing Obamacare and her vision for the future of healthcare in the United States.",
    " Title: FBI Investigates Alleged Plot to Falsely Accuse Special Counsel Robert Mueller of Sexual Misconduct\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, an apparent attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has come to light, potentially implicating conservative activists in a scheme with the FBI.\n\n\"When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation,\" Mueller's spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe specifics of the scheme remain unclear, including its intended target. However, the plot gained public attention after pro-Trump Twitter personality Jacob Wohl hinted at such allegations on Monday night, causing alarm among journalists who perceived it as a smear campaign.\n\nKey figures involved in the matter appear to be Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative known for his speedy, sycophantic responses to President Trump's tweets, implausible, factually dubious claims, and running shady hedge funds. Also implicated is Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, who has a history of making false claims, such as a mystery witness proving DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered by the government or someone accusing a member of Congress of sexual harassment.\n\nThe exact nature of Wohl and Burkman's involvement is unclear. They may have been part of the plot to drum up the allegations, or they may have been trolling the media. It is also possible that Wohl was manipulating Burkman in some way.\n\nInvestigation into the matter led to the scrutiny of Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating these allegations. Wohl was evasive about his involvement in Surefire or the plot in general, but Burkman openly told Hill Reporter that \"Surefire is a real company\" run by \"Jacob Wohl.\" Further investigation suggests that Surefire may be a one-man operation run by Wohl.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit, for which Wohl writes, published a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller. The document's author's name was blacked out, but it used a slogan also found on the Surefire website. After much mockery on Twitter, Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft removed the document and stated he was \"looking into\" the \"serious allegations against Jacob Wohl.\"\n\nThe FBI is now investigating the matter, with Mueller's office commenting on the allegations and referring them to the FBI for investigation. If this is a trolling attempt, it has, in a way, been successful. However, if the purpose of the scheme was to troll journalists as much as to smear Mueller and the investigation, then the trolls have already achieved their goal.\n\nThe midterm elections are fast approaching, and this matter has diverted journalistic resources from other topics. Burkman still claims he will reveal \"the first\" of Mueller's accusers at a press conference this Thursday. If this follows the pattern of his previous hyped press conferences, it will likely be a disappointment. But if the goal was to divert attention and change the subject, then the plan has succeeded.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Race: Roy Moore Files Lawsuit to Contest Election Result, Alleges Voting Irregularities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican candidate Roy Moore has filed a lawsuit to challenge the result of the recent Alabama Senate election, alleging voting irregularities in 20 precincts. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, comes two weeks after the vote and a day before the official certification of Doug Jones as the winner.\n\nThe lawsuit, which calls for a fraud investigation and a potential new election, alleges that there were voting irregularities in the deeply conservative state. The complaint aims to preserve evidence of potential election fraud and postpone the certification of Alabama's Special Election by Secretary of State John Merrill until a thorough investigation of potential election fraud can be conducted.\n\nDoug Jones, who won the election narrowly by about 20,000 votes, is expected to be sworn in by Vice-President Pence on 3 January, according to Mr. Merrill. The election result was a blow to President Trump, who had given Mr. Moore his full-throated support, even as other Republicans distanced themselves following the misconduct allegations.\n\nFour women have accused Mr. Moore, then in his early thirties, of assaulting, molesting, or pursuing them when they were teenagers, including sexually touching one when she was 14. He denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. His supporters, including his wife Kayla Moore, have promoted unfounded theories that his accusers were paid.\n\nMr. Merrill, the Alabama Secretary of State, has so far found no evidence of voter fraud but pledged that his office would investigate any complaint submitted by Mr. Moore. Conspiracy theories have spread in online conservative groups since the election, alleging without evidence that black voters were bussed in from other states to vote for Mr. Jones.\n\nThroughout his political career, Mr. Moore has provoked controversy, suggesting that 9/11 happened because of declining Christian values, calling for Muslims to be barred from office, and strongly opposing gay marriage.",
    " Title: Record Wall Street Contributions Favor GOP Candidates in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2022 midterm elections, a significant shift in political contributions from the banking and investment sectors has been observed, with 63% of the donations going to Republican candidates, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. This marks the largest dollar figure ($78 million) and percentage for the GOP in any midterm election.\n\nThe increased contributions are indicative of a strategic move by Wall Street players who believe Republicans have a better chance of winning on Tuesday. Dorsey Farr, co-founder of French Wolf & Farr, an investment advisory firm in Atlanta, explained, \"You want to be with the winner.\" He further added, \"A lot of times you'll see companies give to both parties. If they see the tide turning, they'll go with the flow.\"\n\nThe figures do not include donations channeled through political action committees, which have become increasingly significant in campaign finance in recent years. The increased election expenditures from the financial world this time around can also be attributed to the Democratic Party's increased regulatory focus since the financial crisis.\n\nRay La Raja, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, noted, \"Democrats are just more of the regulatory party.\" He added, \"In the past, bankers could work with any party. Now, all things being equal, they'd rather work with Republicans.\"\n\nBeyond strategic calculations, there is also a philosophical element, with many on Wall Street feeling they have been demonized by the current administration. The major banks have paid out multi-billion settlements in recent years for their role in the financial meltdown.\n\nThe political landscape remains polarized, with prominent figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton continuing to criticize Wall Street. However, Wall Street has not completely abandoned the Democratic Party. Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) was the top recipient of contributions from the investment community this election, having raised almost $1.9 million. Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York), a traditional ally of Wall Street, pulled in about $850,000.\n\nRay La Raja concluded, \"I'm sure they're not going to piss off a powerful Democrat.\" The populist theme, resonating with voters due to the sluggish economic recovery, is expected to continue into the 2016 Presidential election. However, if the economy improves, populism may subside.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Officially Opposes Death Penalty in All Circumstances, Marking a Shift in Catholic Teachings\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis has officially changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, marking a significant shift in the Church's doctrine. The Vatican announced that the Catechism of the Church, a codified doctrine which sums up teachings, now states that the death penalty is \"inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.\"\n\nPreviously, the Catechism had stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases. However, the new text argues that today's more effective detention methods protect citizens and \"do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.\"\n\nPope Francis has long been an advocate against executions, speaking out against them in the past. Last October, he stated that the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns.\n\nThe text of the catechism was first set by Pope John Paul II in October 1992, and earlier stated that the death penalty was \"an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.\"\n\nThe Church will now work with determination for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, according to a statement from the Holy See. The Catholic Church, which bases its faith on an unchanging Bible, has historically been mostly unopposed to the death penalty, including into the 20th Century.\n\nIn modern times, popes have re-invented themselves as symbols of global peace. However, until now, the Church had taught that the death penalty was \"an acceptable, albeit extreme means of safeguarding the common good.\" Pope Francis, who has made mercy a theme of his papacy, has now decided that this has to change by ruling the death penalty \"inadmissible.\"\n\nThis may put the Church in direct conflict with conservative Catholics in the US who insist that capital punishment is justified. The death penalty is still legal in 53 countries around the world, including in the United States, where execution is still legal in 31 states. It is also still legal in Cuba, Dominica, and Uganda - where about half of their populations are Catholic.\n\nThe only place in Europe where it is still legal is Belarus, which has a sizeable Catholic minority of about 7% of the population. Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Benin, where significant chunks of the population follow Catholicism, have all outlawed the death penalty in recent years.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Tread Carefully Amidst Chick-fil-A Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heated political climate of the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, the culture war over gay marriage has become a significant issue, particularly for the conservative base. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, are navigating this sensitive topic carefully, as they aim to appeal to their respective bases while avoiding alienating key voter demographics.\n\nObama, who supports gay marriage, has chosen to remain silent on the issue regarding the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, which has become a focal point of the debate due to recent comments made by a family member of the company's founder. The president's silence is likely a strategic move, as he seeks to maintain support from religious conservatives within the African-American community and blue-collar Democratic voters in states like Ohio and Virginia.\n\nRomney, who supports a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, has also chosen to avoid the topic, mirroring Obama's approach. Romney has previously praised Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, but has remained silent on the issue since May, when the company's stance on gay marriage sparked controversy.\n\nIn a recent interview, Romney declined to comment on the ongoing Chick-fil-A controversy, stating that the issue is not part of his campaign. He also refused to comment on Republican figures such as Rick Santorum, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee dining at Chick-fil-A, citing a desire to focus on his economic message.\n\nRalph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, argues that Romney has an opportunity to gain ground with the social conservative base by engaging in the debate. Reed contends that the majority of Americans, even those who may not agree with the personal views of Chick-fil-A's executives, believe it was inappropriate for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino to suggest that the company would face difficulties obtaining permits in their cities.\n\nAs the election approaches, both candidates are walking a fine line, balancing their need to appeal to their bases with the need to maintain a broad electoral coalition. The Chick-fil-A controversy serves as a microcosm of this delicate balance, highlighting the importance of cultural issues in the 2012 Presidential election.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Grows at 3.5 Percent in Third Quarter, Consumer Spending Leads Growth\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department's report on Friday. This growth rate is slightly slower than the second quarter's 4.2 percent, but it puts the economy on track for the fastest annual growth in 13 years.\n\nThe growth was driven by a 4 percent increase in consumer spending, the fastest in about four years. This strong showing is a reflection of the high employment rate, as stated by former White House economist Jared Bernstein. \"Lots of people are working and drawing paychecks,\" he said. \"Even if those paychecks are not growing as fast as we might like, that's going to fuel economic growth, and in this report, in fact, the strongest sector was consumer spending.\"\n\nThe travel industry was one sector that benefited from this increased spending. Elie Maalouf, Americas CEO of IHG, the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and other chains, noted, \"We set records around Labor Day and Memorial Day this year and Fourth of July in terms of travel, and so they're spending more for trips and they're spending more with us.\"\n\nHowever, overall growth may have been affected, in part, by Hurricane Florence, which caused $37 billion in property and equipment losses in September. Hurricane Michael, which hit the Florida Panhandle and Georgia earlier this month, could also impact fourth-quarter GDP.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently boosted its growth projection to 3.1 percent for 2018, but it expects growth to slow to 2.5 percent next year. The economy has been expanding in the 2 percent range in the past few years, but growth spiked in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and exports. However, exports decreased at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter after jumping 9.3 percent in the second quarter.\n\nWith unemployment at nearly 50-year lows, consumers have been confident enough to spend. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence rose in September, and retail sales grew 4.7 percent last month from a year earlier.\n\nDespite the strong economic growth, the housing market is starting to show signs of slowing, amid higher interest rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.5 percent in September, marking the fourth monthly drop in a row, and resales were down 3.4 percent.\n\nPresident Trump has continued his attacks on the Federal Reserve, as the central bank has been raising interest rates as the economy recovers from the Great Recession. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are approaching 5 percent, which may discourage some homebuying.",
    " Title: Four Individuals Charged with Hate Crimes in Alleged Assault Streamed Live on Facebook\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, four individuals have been charged with hate crimes following an assault that was live-streamed on Facebook. The incident, which took place in Chicago, involved a man being tied up, beaten, and cut with a knife by several assailants.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed that the victim, who has been reported missing before the attack, has \"mental health challenges.\" He is currently recovering in the hospital. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson stated at a news conference on Thursday afternoon that the incident was investigated as a hate crime due to the victim's mental capacity, race, and other factors.\n\nThe Facebook Live stream showing the attack has been removed. However, multiple outlets have posted videos they identify as archives of the stream, recorded by a woman who frequently turns the camera on herself. The clips show multiple people taunting, threatening, and hitting a man who is tied up in a corner. At least once, a man uses a knife to cut the victim's hair, cutting into his scalp.\n\nOn the video, the assailants, who are black, say \"F * * * Donald Trump\" and \"F * * * white people.\" They force the victim, who is white, to say \"F * * * Donald Trump,\" as well.\n\nThe four people accused of the crime have each been charged with a hate crime, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Cook County State's Attorney's office. Other charges include burglary, robbery, and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.\n\nAt a news conference late Wednesday, Chicago police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin stated that investigators are working to determine whether the statements about President-elect Donald Trump are \"sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.\"\n\nChicago police found the victim in distress on the street before they were aware of the existence of the Facebook live stream. The four suspects were arrested after police were called to a residence near where they'd found the man and then connected the incident and the location.\n\nThe victim, a resident of a Chicago suburb, apparently spent at least 24 hours in the company of his alleged assailants\u2014one of whom he knew from school, police say. He had been reported missing on Monday. Police say he traveled into the city with his acquaintance in a stolen van.\n\nA GoFundMe account for the victim has been set up. A public relations representative for GoFundMe says the website will be working with the campaign organizer to ensure all money raised reaches the victim.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, Johnson highlighted the \"brazenness\" of the assailants, for not just carrying out the attack but broadcasting it \"for all to see.\"\n\n\"It's sickening,\" he said. \"It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that. I've been a cop for 28 years\u2014I've seen things that you should not see in a lifetime\u2014but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just should not [see].\"",
    " Title: Rep. Joe Heck Expresses Caution on U.S. Military Intervention in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Joe Heck, a veteran and physician who served in the Army Reserve with three deployments including Iraq, has expressed caution regarding the potential U.S. military intervention in Syria. He believes that the U.S. should proceed with caution before entering another Middle Eastern conflict, citing concerns about the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach, potential unintended consequences, lack of clear objectives, and the absence of a clear and imminent threat to U.S. national security interests.\n\nHeck, who represents Nevada's 3rd congressional district, stated that the horrific atrocities perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria are appalling and deserve international condemnation. However, he emphasized that there is a lack of international resolve on the response to such abominable acts.\n\nThe congressman expressed concerns about the potential muddling of the administration's foreign policy approach in the region, given the president's varying strategies in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. He argued that the debate over a military strike in Syria should not be a knee-jerk reaction to the president's failed \"new beginning\" with the Arab world, but rather a careful consideration of the strategic implications of military action.\n\nHeck also raised concerns about the unintended consequences of a \"limited\" military strike, suggesting that it could spark a wider regional conflict that would escalate U.S. involvement. He cited potential attacks against Syrian civilians, retaliation against Israel, and Syrian refugees flooding into neighboring countries as possible outcomes.\n\nThe congressman also criticized the administration for failing to articulate the goals, objectives, and potential costs of a military action in Syria. He argued that the U.S. should not use its military force to deliver a warning shot unless it is willing to sink the ship if the warning is ignored.\n\nFurthermore, Heck questioned whether there is a clear and imminent threat to U.S. national security interests. He suggested that while evil people will do evil things, the U.S. should not take on a situation that could produce the same result as the continued unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, where U.S. intervention has left behind further violence and abuses.\n\nIn conclusion, Rep. Joe Heck has expressed caution regarding U.S. military intervention in Syria, emphasizing the need for a clear threat to U.S. national security interests and a clear strategy of what the U.S. aims to achieve. He warned that anything less would disregard the lessons of recent history and further complicate the situation in Syria and the region while risking precious American blood and treasure.",
    " Title: GOP Immigration Policy: A Battle of Ideas and Values\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Obama's State of the Union address, the Republican Party found itself in a state of internal discord over the contentious issue of immigration. The political news outlet Politico reported on this intraparty tussle with the headline \"Priebus struggles to explain GOP immigration messages.\"\n\nThe article focuses on Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman, who was tasked with clarifying the party's stance on immigration. The challenge arose due to the contrasting responses from Iowa's new senator, Joni Ernst, and Florida Representative Carlos Curbelo. Ernst remained silent on immigration in her 10-minute response to the president, while Curbelo, in a Spanish-language version of the GOP response, urged Obama to collaborate with Republicans to create permanent solutions for the immigration system, secure the borders, and modernize legal immigration.\n\nThe article also mentions the Tea Party response to the president's speech, delivered by Florida Republican Representative Curt Clawson. Clawson, in both English and Spanish, called for embracing legal immigrants and those waiting in line legally to pursue their American Dream.\n\nAdditionally, the article discusses Iowa Representative Steve King's Twitter criticism of President Obama for inviting a \"deportable\" individual, 20-year-old Ana Zamora, to sit in the House gallery as a guest of the First Lady. Zamora, who was brought illegally to the United States as an infant and benefited from Obama's 2012 executive order, sparked controversy.\n\nWhen asked about King's tone, Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio responded carefully, emphasizing the human aspect of the issue: \"We have to always remind ourselves that we're talking about human beings with hopes and dreams and families.\"\n\nThe article concludes by acknowledging the lack of a clear GOP message on immigration but highlights the value of the ongoing debate, as it showcases the diversity of ideas and viewpoints within the party. The article also recommends a new monograph, \"Open Immigration: Yea & Nay,\" published by Encounter Books, featuring essays by Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies and Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute.\n\nThe monograph offers a thoughtful exploration of the immigration issue, with each author presenting clear, factual, and respectful arguments for their respective positions. Krikorian, an immigration restrictionist, argues that mass immigration is harmful in the 21st century, while Nowrasteh advocates for more legal immigration, citing its economic benefits and consistency with principles of limited government, free markets, and individual liberty.\n\nThe article concludes by acknowledging the fractious nature of the current immigration debate within the Republican Party but emphasizes the potential for productive, thoughtful discourse, as demonstrated by Krikorian and Nowrasteh's essays. The article suggests that, despite the challenges, the ongoing debate over immigration can lead to a more informed and nuanced understanding of the issue.",
    " Title: Trump's \"Merry Christmas\" Campaign Promise Fulfilled: A Shift in Cultural Tone, According to Christian Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly fulfilling his campaign promise to make it acceptable to say \"Merry Christmas\" again, according to Dr. Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary.\n\n\"The whole tone has shifted in this country since Nov. 8,\" Dr. Land told Charisma News. \"In fact, just a few days after the election, I had several people say to me, 'Merry Christmas! Wow, it's okay to say that now!'\"\n\nThis anecdote encapsulates a broader truth, as President-elect Trump's victory has allegedly dealt a significant blow to the totalitarian instincts, political correctness, progressivism, and extreme prejudice that are often associated with political correctness.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump frequently referenced Christmas, tapping into the pent-up anger felt by millions of Americans over the perceived \"War on Christmas\" at the highest levels of government, including the White House, during the Obama administration.\n\nNow, Trump is reportedly following through on his promise. During his \"thank you\" tour, he is traveling the country, speaking to the masses from a podium adorned with a large, red sign that reads, \"Merry Christmas\" - a phrase he also repeats multiple times during his speech. The stage is further adorned with two Christmas trees.\n\nRecipients of a Christmas card from the Trump family will notice it bears the message, \"Merry Christmas.\" In contrast, the current president, Barack Obama, has omitted the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" from his family's holiday cards during his entire eight-year presidency, instead opting for the politically correct \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\nChristians, who are reported to have played a significant role in Trump's election, with 81 percent of white Evangelicals voting for the billionaire businessman, are said to be grateful for a federal government that is more friendly to traditional Christian beliefs in the public square.\n\n\"Our President-elect Trump will foster a federal government that is much more friendly to traditional beliefs about Christianity in the public square,\" Land said. \"People are grateful for that, and they feel it\u2014that the federal government will no longer be working as a public censor, and Americans are enjoying their newfound rights to communicate their true beliefs about Christmas. Mr. Trump has said we're free to say 'Merry Christmas' again. And so this is, broadly speaking, a win for cultural conservatism, which in America is intertwined with orthodox, traditional Christianity over progressivism and multiculturalism.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Senators' Unprecedented Attack on Supreme Court's Integrity in Gun Control Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, five Democratic senators have filed a legal brief attacking the integrity of the conservative justices on the Supreme Court, warning of potential political action if the Court does not rule in favor of New York City's gun control laws. The brief, filed in the case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. the City of New York, is a stark departure from legal norms and raises concerns about the senators' attempt to influence the Court's decision-making process.\n\nThe brief, authored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal, Richard Durbin, and Kirsten Gillibrand, aims to support New York City's argument that the case is moot and should be dismissed. However, the true intent of the brief is to cast aspersions on the integrity of the Court itself.\n\nThe senators question the sources of funding for amicus briefs opposing New York's gun control laws and suggest that the petitioners' supporters may be controlled by a \"puppetmaster.\" They also highlight the number of 5-4 decisions in which Republican-appointed justices have provided all five votes in the majority, implying that these justices are doing the bidding of their \"corporate and Republican\" masters.\n\nThe brief's language is highly partisan and lacks any acknowledgment of the competing judicial philosophies among justices or the frequent voting together of Democratic- and Republican-appointed justices. The senators also make unfounded claims about the Court's influence on sensitive areas like voting rights, partisan gerrymandering, and access to federal court.\n\nThe filing is a stark departure from the norms of legal argument and raises concerns about the senators' attempt to influence the Court's decision-making process. The Supreme Court is not well, and the people know it. The senators' actions are a reminder of the urgent need for the Court to heal itself before the public demands it be \"restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\"",
    " Title: Fact-Checking in the 2016 Presidential Election: A Time to Shine for Journalists Amidst a Sea of Misinformation\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election approaches, professional fact-checkers are finding themselves in a whirlwind of activity. With 22 major-party candidates during the primaries, the task of verifying the truthfulness of public statements was challenging. However, the general election pitting Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton, two candidates with low honesty scores among voters, has sent the fact-checking world into overdrive.\n\nIs Mr. Trump really worth $10 billion, as he claims? (Not according to Forbes magazine.) Is it true that Mrs. Clinton \"slept\" during the Benghazi terror attack in 2012, as Trump says? (No, according to Clinton testimony.) Was Clinton allowed to use a personal email server when she was secretary of State, as she has asserted? (No, according to a recent report by the State Department's Office of the Inspector General.)\n\nTrump alone is enough to keep the entire fact-checking industry afloat. When the flamboyant billionaire gave a big speech recently denouncing Clinton, the Associated Press assigned 12 reporters just to check the veracity of his assertions \u2013 \"a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could have been doing other things,\" moaned Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple.\n\nThe barrage of charges of lying hurled around has left some voters disheartened, leading some to tune out and stay home on Election Day. But to veteran fact-checkers, it's a time to shine. Angie Drobnic Holan, editor in chief of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact.com, says she's \"really optimistic,\" citing the growth of media fact-checking.\n\n\"You can have a cynical take on that, but mine is more optimistic,\" because fact-checking is especially needed this year, she says. \"Donald Trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy, and I'm heartened that there's widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be fact-checked.\"\n\nTrump supporters, not surprisingly, disagree. Jeffrey Lord, a regular on CNN defending Trump, calls media fact-checkers \"elitist\" and says the candidates themselves do a better job of countering each other's assumptions. This \"self-policing\" concept sounds a bit like having a basketball game with no referees. And besides, it's just not going to happen. Media fact-checking is here to stay.\n\nSo are politicians who say things that aren't true and accuse each other of lying. But there's a spectrum of political speech: there are out-and-out lies \u2013 deliberately false statements meant to deceive \u2013 then there are statements that are unintentionally false, exaggerations, and spin. Sorting through the differences can be impossible, as it requires knowing what's inside the speaker's head.\n\nAnd what about a candidate who makes big promises, knowing they can't be fulfilled? That's another form of political speech that is less-than-truthful, but which voters have come to expect \u2013 and often excuse.\n\nIn a recent focus group, veteran pollster Peter Hart asked 12 Republicans if they thought a President Trump would ever actually build a wall across the Mexican border. Eight people voted no. Same with his promise to deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the US. And yet most of the 12 were fine that these promises would likely go unfulfilled.\n\n\"They don't hear a pledge, they hear, 'I'm going to do something,'\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, which sponsored the focus group.\n\nBut making pie-in-the-sky promises is one thing. Statements of fact that prove false are another, and that's where fact-checkers are having a field day. PolitiFact has judged 174 statements by Trump so far, and found only 16 to be either true or mostly true. Seventy have been judged false, and another 34 rated \"Pants on Fire,\" referring to claims that are \"not only inaccurate but also ridiculous,\" according to Ms. Holan.\n\nWith Clinton, PolitiFact has judged 218 statements and rated 112 true or mostly true, 24 false, and three \"Pants on Fire.\"\n\nThe next question is whether the assessments of PolitiFact and other fact-checkers actually penetrate public consciousness?\n\n\"Our traffic is better than it's ever been,\" says Holan, whose site is affiliated with the Tampa Bay Times. \"Media organizations are doing fact-checking in part because it's very popular with readers.\"\n\nProfessor Jamieson, whose Annenberg center launched the first political fact-checking website, FactCheck.org, in 2003, is less sanguine.\n\n\"Fact-checking has never been more important, more complicated, and less likely to reach its target audience with the desired corrected information,\" Jamieson says.\n\nPart of the problem is the ever-accelerating news cycle. \"In order to get a correction through, you have to get people to stand still long enough to hear it,\" she says.\n\nAnother issue, particularly for fact-checking operations attached to news sites, is low public opinion of the media. Only 6 percent of Americans have a \"great deal of confidence\" in the press, according to a survey released in April by the Media Insight Project.\n\nHolan of PolitiFact says that when readers accuse her site of partisan bias against Trump, she counters with data that show Republicans who do well on the PolitiFact \"Truth-o-Meter,\" such as Jeb Bush.\n\nOf course, former Governor Bush didn't do very well as a presidential candidate; voters don't necessarily favor a candidate because he or she is more factual. Moreover, for a slice of the electorate, this cycle reflects a break from politics as usual \u2013 and that includes an embrace of candidates who speak to voters without the filter of polls, focus groups, and scripted statements.",
    " Title: The Political and Economic Impact of U.S.-China Trade Tensions on Soybean Farmers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, as exemplified by the imposition of tariffs on various goods, have significant economic and political implications, particularly for the soybean industry. The U.S., being the world's leading soybean producer, exports a substantial portion of its production to China, the world's largest consumer. In 2017, China purchased over $14 billion worth of American-grown soybeans, accounting for 61% of total U.S. soybean exports and more than 30% of overall U.S. soybean production.\n\nThe potential 25% tariff on soybeans and other agricultural products threatened by China in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could pose challenges for the Republican Party, particularly in key congressional races across the Midwest, where states like Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and North Dakota are significant soybean producers. The political implications of these trade disputes are becoming increasingly apparent, as the GOP seeks to maintain control of Congress this year, with key Senate races in Missouri and North Dakota, and the House of Representatives hanging in the balance.\n\nIn an effort to gauge the sentiments of farmers in soybean-producing regions, The New York Times has dispatched a reporter to Cass County, North Dakota, the nation's top soybean-producing county. Fourth-generation farmer Robert Runck, in an interview with the Times, expressed his concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade skirmishes with China, stating, \"If he does not understand what he's doing to the nation by doing what he's doing, he's going to be a one-term president, plain and simple.\" Runck also indicated that the tariffs could cost Republican congressman Kevin Cramer, who currently represents North Dakota, some votes in the upcoming Senate race against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D\u2013N.D.).\n\nAn analysis by the Brookings Institution suggests that Trump's tariffs could inflict the most economic damage on red states, including Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The pain from Chinese tariffs on American agricultural products is again concentrated in the Midwest, according to the Brookings Institution's findings.\n\nTrump's tariffs are part of his campaign promise to revive American steel plants, but these protectionist policies could come at the expense of a larger group within the president's political coalition. For every steel-producing job in the country, there are about 46 steel-consuming jobs, many of which are now on shakier ground due to the higher costs created by tariffs.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove told the Times that Trump \"has little to no understanding of the farm coalition.\" Trump, a New Yorker with a background in real estate and entertainment, may not have a detailed understanding of the concerns of a North Dakota farmer or an Ohio machine shop worker. However, Trump's supporters have historically not cared that the president is not like them.\n\nThe challenge for Trump and the Republican Party lies in the fact that, while the president won the American heartland by promising to end a regulatory war on agricultural and industrial jobs, he now risks replacing one set of oppressive economic policies with another, placing farmers and manufacturers on the front lines of a trade war. The fact that Trump is not directly responsible for Chinese tariffs on soybeans may not save him, or the rest of his party, from the ire of those who suffer the consequences of these myopic trade policies.\n\nIn essence, the political clich\u00e9 that people vote with their wallets may hold true even for a president who shattered many other traditional notions of how to get elected. The trade tensions between the U.S. and China could have significant political ramifications for the Republican Party, particularly in the upcoming midterm elections, as farmers and manufacturers in soybean-producing regions grapple with the economic impact of these policies.",
    " Title: Clinton Tries to Regroup and Appeal to Democratic Party Establishment as Primary Race Heats Up\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic primary race heats up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is making a concerted effort to regroup and appeal to the party establishment, a group that has become increasingly nervous about her campaign. Clinton, who has been under fire for her use of a private email account during her tenure as Secretary of State, is facing stiff competition from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and potential challenger Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a speech at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis on Friday, Clinton emphasized her commitment to the party and her determination to win the nomination. \"I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not going to stop now,\" she said. \"In fact, I'm just getting warmed up.\"\n\nClinton vowed that she is \"not taking a single primary voter or caucusgoer for granted.\" However, party leaders are growing concerned that Clinton has not been able to wrest control of the narrative surrounding her email controversy. The issue has caused many to bite their nails and has given her competitors a glimmer of hope that there is an opening for someone else.\n\nSanders, who is an independent senator from Vermont, received a boost on Saturday with a new Iowa poll showing him gaining on Clinton, trailing the front-runner by just 7 points. Sanders took aim at the party's establishment, arguing that \"politics as usual\" and \"same old, same old\" will not work in energizing Democratic voters to turn out at the polls.\n\n\"We lost because voter turnout was abysmally, embarrassingly low, and millions of working people, young people, and people of color gave up on politics as usual and they stayed home,\" Sanders said. \"With all due respect \u2014 and I do not mean to insult anyone here \u2014 that turnout, that enthusiasm will not happen with politics as usual. The same old, same old will not work.\"\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley also took aim at the party's establishment, repeating his criticism of the Democratic debate schedule, which begins in October. He described it as a \"rigged process\" and \"a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debates.\"\n\nBiden did not attend the meeting in Minneapolis, but in a conference call last week, the vice president told DNC members that he has been talking with his family about whether or not to enter the race. He said if he runs, he wants to give the campaign his whole heart and soul. \"And right now, both are pretty well banged up,\" Biden said, referring to the death of his son Beau, a rising star in the Democratic Party, in May.\n\nAhead of her speech, Clinton released a series of memos highlighting her organizational strength in the four early voting states. She campaigned in Iowa last week with Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor. Vilsack was asked if his endorsement of Clinton, while Biden is considering a run, will make for awkward Cabinet meetings.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden \u2014 just like we all do,\" Vilsack said. \"He's a wonderful man.\" But he said campaigns require difficult choices, and he and his wife are supporting Clinton.\n\nIt may already be too late for Biden in the minds of many DNC members, who have already backed Clinton. Take, for example, Florida committeeman Jon M. Ausman, who said this to Politico in Minneapolis: \"He doesn't reach out to me for seven f*cking years and then he wants me to help him out? I don't think so. I don't really give a sh*t. I don't care if he gets into the race or not.\"\n\nBy rolling out early endorsements, Clinton is wise to try to make a show of strength now to ward off a Biden run, says Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Elleithee is also the immediate past DNC communications director and worked for Clinton's 2008 campaign.\n\n\"He will not have oxygen in the room if she has locked people down,\" Elleithee said. \"I think he is probably looking at the field and saying, 'OK, at this late date in the process, can I build the organization? Can I raise the money? And can my message break through?'\"\n\nAsked about Biden, Clinton said she believes the vice president is facing a tough decision, and she wants to give him the space and time to make it. She told reporters in Minneapolis that she's also learned some lessons from her primary loss to President Obama in 2008.\n\n\"I got a lot of votes,\" she said, \"but I did not \u2014 I did not get enough delegates. And, so, I think it's understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates as well as votes this time.\"",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 9525: Shocking Revelation of Pilot Being Locked Out of Cockpit Before Crash\n\nA startling discovery has been made in the investigation of the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to a report by The New York Times. The report states that one of the plane's pilots was locked out of the cockpit before the crash, as revealed by audio recordings from the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nAccording to the Times, a senior military official involved in the investigation described audio from the cockpit voice recorder, one of the plane's black boxes. \"You can hear he is trying to smash the door down,\" the official said, referring to the pilot trying to gain entry to the cockpit.\n\nLufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said it was looking into the report. \"We have no information from the bodies investigating the incident that would corroborate the report in The New York Times,\" spokesman Boris Ogursky said. \"We will not participate in speculation, but we will follow up on the matter.\"\n\nThe Times' report is a \"terribly shocking revelation,\" CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz said. But he and other experts cautioned that it's still unclear what could have been going on inside the cockpit. Possibilities range from a medical emergency to something more nefarious, like a suicide mission.\n\nOfficials previously said that they hadn't ruled out terrorism, but it seems unlikely. French authorities revealed earlier Wednesday that they'd been able to access audio from the recorder, even though its external casing was damaged. But they disclosed few details about what the recording actually contained, saying only that there was one audio channel with voices on it that went all the way up to the time of the crash.\n\nFinding the plane's second black box, the flight data recorder, will also be critical to understanding the mystery of what went on inside the jet. That box hasn't been found yet, but Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Wednesday that there's a high probability it will be.\n\nThe mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access. Investigators scoured dangerous terrain in the French Alps as they searched for clues in the wreckage. Workers dropped to the crash site from helicopters, Jouty said, and had to be tied together because the steep area in the mountains is so treacherous.\n\nSpohr said Tuesday's plane crash \"represents the darkest hours\" in the history of his company, which owns Germanwings. Officials are struggling to understand how an airplane that \"was in perfect technical condition\" with two experienced pilots \"was involved in such a terrible accident,\" he said. But even worse, he said, is seeing the heartbreak of the relatives and friends of the victims who perished in the crash.\n\nSpecial Lufthansa flights will take relatives and friends of victims to southern France on Thursday, so they can be near the search scene, he said. \"We need to understand what happened,\" French President Francois Hollande said. \"We owe that to the families.\"\n\nThe doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday in the French Alps. Teams have begun the daunting task of identifying the victims' bodies, but caution that it could take time to complete. Investigators are still trying to piece together what caused the crash.",
    " Title: U.S., Russia, and UN Negotiate Syrian Chemical Weapons as Precursor to Peace Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 The prospects for resuming peace talks in Syria's civil war hinge on the outcome of negotiations for the Syrian government to relinquish its chemical weapons, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated Friday, as discussions on the chemical arsenal entered a second day.\n\nKerry, Lavrov, and U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi convened to discuss the potential for a new Geneva peace conference, while American and Russian chemical weapons experts were engaged in a hotel, hashing out technical details crucial to a deal on chemical weapons. The backdrop to these negotiations is the looming threat of a limited U.S. military strike against President Bashar Assad if he fails to surrender his chemical weapons in a timely manner.\n\nBrahimi underscored the high stakes, telling Kerry and Lavrov that the chemical weapons negotiation \"is extremely important in itself and for itself, but it is also extremely important for us who are working with you on trying to bring together the Geneva conference successfully.\"\n\nMore than 100,000 people have been killed in two years of civil war. On Friday, the international group Human Rights Watch accused the Syrian government and militias fighting on its side of carrying out summary executions that killed at least 248 people in two towns in May.\n\nKerry, flanked by Lavrov and Brahimi, told reporters after an hour-long meeting that the chances for a second peace conference in Geneva will require success first with the chemical weapons talks, which have been \"constructive\" so far.\n\n\"I will say on behalf of the United States that President (Barack) Obama is deeply committed to a negotiated solution with respect to Syria,\" Kerry said. \"We are working hard to find the common ground to be able to make that happen.\"\n\nKerry, Lavrov, and Brahimi agreed to meet around Sept. 28 on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly high-level meetings in New York. However, the future of peace negotiations depends on the outcome of the weapons talks.\n\n\"We are committed to try to work together, beginning with this initiative on the chemical weapons, in hopes that those efforts could pay off and bring peace and stability to a war-torn part of the world,\" Kerry added.\n\nBrahimi also met privately with Kerry at a Geneva hotel on Thursday to explore ways to resume international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012 aimed at ending the Syrian civil war.\n\nLavrov said Russia has supported the peace process from the start of the Syrian conflict and discussed with Kerry and Brahimi the Geneva communique from the 2012 meeting on Syria and ways of preparing for a second conference.\n\n\"It is very unfortunate that for a long period the Geneva communique was basically abandoned,\" said Lavrov.\n\nHe said that document \"means that the Syrian parties must reach mutual consent on the transitional governing organ, which would come with full executive authority. And the communique also says that all groups of Syrian society must be represented.\"\n\nWhen the chemical weapons talks began Thursday, Kerry rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a \"standard process\" by turning over information rather than weapons\u2014and nothing immediately. The American diplomat said that was not acceptable.\n\n\"The words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough,\" Kerry declared as he stood beside Lavrov. \"This is not a game.\"\n\nSalem Al Meslet, a senior member of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, expressed disappointment that the Kerry and Lavrov meeting on chemical weapons wasn't about punishing Assad.\n\n\"They are leaving the murderer and concentrating on the weapons he was using,\" he said of Assad. \"It is like stabbing somebody with a knife then they take the knife away and he is free.\"\n\nHe spoke on the sidelines of a two-day opposition conference in Istanbul.\n\nThe talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the Aug. 21 gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The U.S. blames Assad for the use of chemical weapons. Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to the rebels fighting a 2-year-old civil war against it.\n\nPresident Barack Obama began trying to win support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Assad's forces, but put that effort on hold when the Syrian government expressed willingness to turn over weapons to international control. Obama dispatched Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of U.S. military action.\n\nU.N. associate spokesman Farhan Haq said Friday that the documents Syria submitted to join the international treaty banning chemical weapons were still being reviewed to determine whether they provide enough information. If accepted as complete, Syria would become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention 30 days later, Haq said.\n\nSyria's ambassador to the United Nations had said that as of Thursday when it submitted the documents, his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons.\n\nAssad, in an interview with Russia's Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the U.S. halted threats of military action.\n\nAt a meeting in Kyrgyzstan on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Syria's efforts have demonstrated its good faith.\n\n\"I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,\" Putin said.",
    " Title: Trump and Sanders Debate Proposal: A Tale of Twists and Turns\n\nArticle:\n\nA whirlwind of confusion enveloped the political landscape on Thursday as the possibility of a debate between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders unfolded, only to be met with a series of reversals from the Republican nominee.\n\nAfter igniting a media frenzy by accepting an offer to debate Sanders, Trump appeared to change his mind at least twice in the same day when pressed about the seriousness of the prospect.\n\nAddressing reporters during his first press conference after crossing the delegate threshold to secure the Republican nomination, Trump reiterated his willingness to debate Sanders for charity, with a proposed donation of at least $10 million. This came after Trump's campaign stated earlier in the day that the Republican was only joking when he initially expressed his openness to debating Sanders during an appearance on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd love to debate Bernie \u2013 he's a dream,\" Trump said at the press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota, on Thursday. \"The problem with debating Bernie is he's going to lose [the Democratic race]... but I'd debate him anyway. We've already had a couple of calls from the networks, so we'll see.\"\n\nHe added, \"If I debated him, we would have such high ratings, and I think we should take that money and give it to some worthy charity.\" Trump had previously refused to take part in any further Republican debates after the Florida primary when the field winnowed down to three candidates.\n\nBernie Sanders ( @BernieSanders ) tweeted, \"I am delighted that @realDonaldTrump has agreed to debate. Let's do it in the biggest stadium possible.\" Sanders' campaign confirmed they were serious about the opportunity if Trump was, but an aide to Trump clarified on Thursday that the former reality TV star was joking and had no intention to actually debate Sanders.\n\nA debate between candidates from both parties before the conclusion of the nominating process would have been highly unusual and potentially problematic for Hillary Clinton, who turned down an invitation from Fox News to debate Sanders earlier this week \u2013 citing the need to shift gears toward the looming battle with Trump in November.\n\n\"We believe that Hillary Clinton's time is best spent campaigning and meeting directly with voters across California and preparing for a general election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands,\" Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jen Palmieri said in a statement.\n\nA debate during the remainder of the primary season would indeed be more beneficial to Sanders, offering him another public platform to make his case in what has been a grueling contest against Clinton. The senator has often referred to poll numbers on the stump that show him faring better than Clinton in a hypothetical match-up against Trump, although Clinton has countered that she has spent more than two decades in the public eye whereas Sanders has yet to be vetted at the national level.\n\nTrump, although evidently unwilling to debate the senator, has made overtures toward Sanders' supporters by echoing their complaints that the establishment is working in Clinton's favor.\n\n\"The system is rigged against him,\" Trump told Kimmel, referring to Sanders. \"I think it's very unfair.\"\n\nSanders and Clinton last faced off on the debate stage on 9 March in Miami. Since then, Clinton has marched significantly closer to sealing the nomination but has still lost a series of contests to Sanders along the way.\n\nSanders has routinely charged that the DNC, which remains officially neutral in the primary, is aiding Clinton by limiting debates and scheduling them on weekends when there would be less of an audience. The senator's disdain for party leaders escalated last week, when Sanders said he would not reappoint Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chair of the DNC if elected president and endorsed her primary opponent as she seeks re-election to Congress in south Florida.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and founder of the center-left thinktank New Democrat Network, wrote in a column this week that the California debate should proceed as initially planned between Clinton and Sanders.\n\n\"For the DNC to walk away from the debate now, given that Sanders has signaled his desire to proceed, will only confirm the worst suspicions of Sanders partisans,\" Rosenberg wrote.",
    " Title: The New York Times Endorses Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar for Democratic Presidential Nomination\n\nThe New York Times editorial board has broken with tradition by endorsing two Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination: Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). The endorsement comes just two weeks before the first primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nIn a departure from the usual practice of endorsing a single candidate, the Times' endorsement reads, \"Choosing who should face off against [President] Trump also means acknowledging that Americans are being confronted with three models for how to govern this country, not two. Democrats must decide which of their two models would be most compelling for the American people and best suited for repairing the Republic.\"\n\nThe endorsement for Warren comes as her campaign faces a new challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose campaign has recently secured a number of high-profile endorsements from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).\n\nThe Times' editorial board wrote that Warren could serve as a vehicle for progressives who worry that Sanders' message is too divisive. \"There are plenty of progressives who are hungry for major change but may harbor lingering concerns about a messenger as divisive as Mr. Sanders,\" the Times wrote. \"At the same time, some moderate Democratic primary voters see Ms. Warren as someone who speaks to their concerns about inequality and corruption. Her earlier leaps in the polls suggest she can attract more of both.\"\n\nThe Times' editors wrote of Klobuchar that the Minnesota senator should take control of the centrist lane currently headed by former Vice President Joe Biden, whom the Times advised should \"pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders.\" Klobuchar, they added, \"is the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit, and sticktoitiveness. Her lengthy tenure in the Senate and bipartisan credentials would make her a deal maker (a real one) and uniter for the wings of the party\u2014and perhaps the nation.\"\n\nThe Times previously endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination in 2016, before going on to endorse her in the general election as well. The Times ended its endorsement Sunday night with a call for voters to rally behind whichever woman they thought best represented their values: \"Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren right now are the Democrats best equipped to lead that debate. May the best woman win.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Voter Identification Law Allowed to Take Effect in Upcoming Election by Federal Appeals Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the State of Wisconsin to enforce its voter identification law in the upcoming November elections. The decision, made on Friday, overturns a district court judge's order that had previously blocked the enforcement of the new law or any similar measures imposing new voter identification requirements.\n\nThe appeals court's order, released Friday afternoon, states, \"Having read the briefs and heard oral argument, this court now stays the injunction issued by the district court. The State of Wisconsin may, if it wishes (and if it is appropriate under rules of state law), enforce the photo ID requirement in this November\u2019s elections.\"\n\nThe court's decision is based on the fact that the state law is materially identical to Indiana's photo ID statute, which the Supreme Court upheld in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board in 2008. The state had asked the appeals court to lift the district judge's order, arguing that it was overbroad. Civil rights groups challenging the measure could seek relief from the full bench of the 7th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court's decision is a rebuff to the Obama Administration, which had filed an amicus brief in July urging the appeals court to uphold the lower court's ruling. The move also comes after a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in July narrowed the new law in ways that make it less likely to have a negative impact on minorities.\n\nTechnically, the appeals court panel did not decide the case on Friday, but simply stayed the lower court's order pending a full resolution of the appeal. The appeal was heard by Judges Frank Easterbrook, Diane Sykes, and John Tinder, who were appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George W. Bush, respectively.",
    " Title: Trump Announces General H.R. McMaster as Permanent National Security Advisor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that solidifies his national security team, President Donald Trump has announced General H.R. McMaster as the permanent National Security Advisor. Keith Kellogg, who has been acting in the role since the resignation of Michael Flynn a week ago, will continue to serve as the council's chief of staff.\n\nDuring a meeting on Sunday, Trump interviewed four candidates for the permanent position, with McMaster and John R. Bolton emerging as the finalists. K.T. McFarland, the top deputy national security adviser, was not mentioned in relation to her future role.\n\nMcMaster, a West Point graduate with a doctorate in military history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, expressed his gratitude to the president and his eagerness to join the national security team. \"I'm grateful to you for that opportunity,\" he said, \"and I look forward to joining the national security team and doing everything that I can to advance and protect the interests of the American people.\"\n\nJohn R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, was also considered for a high-level post in Trump's administration. Trump praised Bolton on Monday, stating that they would find a position for him in a different capacity.\n\nGeneral McMaster has a distinguished military career, having commanded a unit that clashed with Iraq's Republican Guard in one of the biggest tank battles of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, earning him the Silver Star. He gained prominence with his 1997 book, \"Dereliction of Duty,\" which critiqued the Joint Chiefs for not standing up to President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. He cemented his reputation in 2005 during the second Iraq war when he led the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in regaining control of Tal Afar.\n\nThis operation was cited as a textbook example in a manual on counterinsurgency doctrine prepared by General Petraeus, who, along with General Mattis, had a role in drafting that manual. McMaster's approach in Iraq mirrors the strategy General Petraeus implemented when he assumed command in Iraq in 2007 with a surge of troops authorized by President Bush.",
    " Title: Federal Court's Decision on DACA: A Constitutional Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the constitutional order by upholding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, a program initiated during the Obama administration. The court's decision, however, has sparked controversy due to its interpretation of the Trump administration's actions and the implications it carries for the balance of power in the American political system.\n\nThe court's ruling is significant as it asserts that the Trump administration's attempt to rescind DACA, through executive action, is unlawful. The decision is based on the argument that the administration's process for rescinding the policy and the reasons provided were defective.\n\nHowever, the decision's most contentious aspect lies in a concurring opinion by Judge John Owens, who argues that the Trump administration's actions were motivated by \"racial animus,\" thereby barring them from rescinding DACA. This assertion is not the primary basis for the court's decision, but it has sparked debate about the role of federal judges in evaluating the motives of the president.\n\nThe court's decision is a reminder of the intricate balance of power in the American political system, particularly between the executive and the judiciary. The ruling underscores the importance of adhering to procedural requirements when executing policy changes, as well as the potential consequences of perceived bias or discrimination in executive actions.\n\nIt is essential to note that the court's decision does not imply that President Trump poses a threat to the constitutional order. Rather, it highlights the need for due process and the importance of upholding the rule of law, regardless of the president's political affiliation.\n\nThe American people elected Donald Trump as president, and under the constitutional order, he has the right to exercise the same authority over the same things as any other president. The power of the president is circumscribed by the constitution and federal law, not the opinion of judges about the character and behavior of the present occupant. This principle is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the democratic process and the balance of power in the American political system.",
    " Title: Clinton Reiterates Hardline Stance on Iran's Nuclear Ambitions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent conversation, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her long-standing position on Iran's nuclear ambitions, stating that she has consistently advocated for little to no enrichment for Iran. Clinton's stance, she argued, is a consistent line that has been misconstrued as a shift in position compared to the current U.S. administration's negotiators.\n\nDuring the discussion, Clinton clarified that Iran, through the voice of the supreme leader, has taken a maximalist position, demanding 190,000 centrifuges and the right to enrich. She also noted that some in Congress and U.S. allies have taken an opposing position, advocating for absolutely no enrichment.\n\nClinton emphasized the importance of clarity in negotiations, suggesting that the U.S. should be firm in its demands for intensive inspections, clear limits on Iran's nuclear facilities, and a stringent approach to enrichment, either through outside enrichment or constrained enrichment to meet the standard of little-to-no enrichment.\n\nWhen asked about the Iranians' unwillingness to pull back, Clinton acknowledged the ongoing political debate within Iran, suggesting that the supreme leader's position may be softening due to economic and political pressures from sanctions, as well as the country's involvement in regional conflicts such as Syria, Iraq, and potentially Lebanon, and the ongoing tensions with Hamas.\n\nClinton's comments provide insight into her continued hardline stance on Iran's nuclear program and offer a nuanced analysis of the complex political dynamics at play in Iran and the Middle East.",
    " Title: Biden Refuses Apology for Recalling Work with Segregationist Senators, Amidst Ongoing Controversy in Democratic Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a heated Democratic presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden has refused to apologize for reminiscing about his work with two late senators who were known for their support of racial segregation. The controversy, which has been dubbed the ugliest row so far in the race for the White House, has sparked a series of back-and-forth exchanges between Biden and his rivals.\n\nThe controversy began on Tuesday night when Biden, during a fundraiser in New York City, fondly recalled his working relationship with two southern Democratic senators, Mississippi's James Eastland and Georgia's Herman Talmadge, whom he served alongside in the Senate in the 1970s.\n\nBiden, who is currently leading in opinion polls, said at the event that Talmadge had called him \"son\" but never \"boy,\" a reference to how racist whites addressed black men at the time. He also stated, \"At least there was some civility; we got things done.\"\n\nSeveral of Biden's rivals, including Senator Cory Booker and California Senator Kamala Harris, criticized his remarks. Harris, who is black, said Biden did not seem to understand \"the dark history of our country.\" Booker, also black, called the former vice president's comments \"so insulting.\"\n\nHowever, Biden fought back on Wednesday night, telling reporters that \"there's not a racist bone in my body; I've been involved in civil rights my whole career.\" He added, \"We, in fact, detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest.\"\n\nBiden advisor Anita Dunn explained that the story was one Biden had told many times, and the point was to illustrate the importance of being able to work with people, even if they hold positions repugnant to one.\n\nThe back-and-forth has sparked a divide among Democratic lawmakers, with some, such as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, defending Biden. Others, like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have criticized the former vice president.\n\nThe Democratic candidates will travel to South Carolina this weekend to aggressively court support from black voters, a crucial demographic in the race. Biden will be attending the traditional fish fry picnic, which is hosted by Clyburn.\n\nBiden has capitalized on his time as deputy to President Barack Obama, the first-ever black US president, who is still revered among Democrats. Biden launched his campaign in April by condemning President Donald Trump's response to a racist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.",
    " Title: Food Supply Chain Struggles Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: A Focus on Essential Workers and the Future of Agriculture\n\nArticle:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a myriad of challenges, and the food supply chain is no exception. While a nationwide food shortage in the United States is currently unlikely, the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the system, particularly in the labor-intensive sectors that rely on underpaid, overexploited workers.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, grocery stores experienced local shortages due to a sudden shift in consumption patterns. As society went into lockdown, millions rushed to stock up on food supplies, leading to empty shelves in some areas. However, the U.S. still produces more than enough food to meet its needs, and the shortages are primarily the result of supply chains disrupted by the rapid change in consumption patterns.\n\nThe pandemic, however, poses a significant threat to the essential workers who harvest, transport, and stock the food that keeps society functioning. \"The worry in the food supply chain was always about activities that were labor-intensive, and where there weren't proper procedures to protect the people doing the work: produce workers, warehouse employees, transport workers, and store employees,\" said Ananth Iyer, a professor of operations management at Purdue University.\n\nIn recent weeks, grocery store workers and farm laborers have contracted and died from COVID-19 in increasing numbers. In some places, the disease is already pushing these essential workers to a breaking point. This week, a massive meat-processing plant in Minnesota became the latest to shut down after a COVID-19 outbreak among workers. Many employers have continued pressing employees to work in unsafe and exploitative conditions, raising the possibility of more illnesses and shutdowns to come.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic is likely to land hard on these workers when the pandemic ends. Shifting consumption patterns mean that industries maniacally focused on efficiency will likely slash employment levels. Among the victims could also be food service workers\u2014presently frozen out of jobs amid the shutdown\u2014who could return to an economy where far fewer people are willing to venture outside to eat.\n\n\"It's estimated that in the United States, 50 to 55 percent of food consumption normally takes place outside the home, at restaurants, fast food outlets, and entertainment venues,\" added Iyer. \"All of a sudden, that came to a complete halt, and now the question is whether we will even go back to that. If we don't, there will be serious adjustments in the restaurant industry affecting the millions of people who work there.\"\n\nAs is often the case, a socioeconomic crisis is offering the chance for people with political power to push through policies that they'd quietly dreamed of implementing. The present turmoil in the food supply chain is no different: In the wake of the pandemic, the agricultural industry looks ready to place the burden onto its most exploited workers by cutting the wages of migrant farm laborers. In this, they have a willing ally in the White House.\n\nIn the name of supporting farmers, the Trump administration is proposing a new \"wage relief\" program to allow agricultural firms to cut migrant workers' salaries to save money during the pandemic. The proposal has gone largely under the radar while the country reels from news of COVID-19 deaths and job losses. But it may have serious consequences for what American society looks like when people eventually emerge from quarantine.\n\n\"At the moment, the agriculture industry recognizes that the social turmoil caused by the pandemic has created something like a fog of war, in which they can press for lots of things that society normally would have no tolerance for,\" said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's a basic principle of economics that if you successfully cut wages at the lowest rung of the economy, it is going to have a ripple effect up through the blue-collar range. To put it another way, if you depress the wages for the poorest people, you depress wages for everyone.\"\n\nThe pandemic is also exposing the massive inefficiency and waste that takes place in a highly centralized industrial food system. Major cities in the U.S. have seen staggering queues in front of food banks, while at the same time, farmers are destroying excess produce, meat, and dairy in other parts of the country. The shock of the pandemic has suddenly made visible the massive inefficiency and waste that takes place in a highly centralized industrial food system.\n\nAt the same time, some experts say that it is also showing what does work: local networks of farms that are biodiverse and don't run the risk of crashing all at once when something goes wrong. \"We're seeing horror stories of farmers throwing milk away and food being destroyed in fields,\" said Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas and author of \"Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.\" \"But the reality is that these stories are all coming out of industrial supply chains. Farmers who are part of local networks are not throwing away food; in fact, they are rushing to keep up with demand.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Shift in Stances: A Look at the Evolution of Her Political Positions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hillary Clinton officially kicks off her 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, a significant transformation in her political stances is evident. Compared to her 2008 campaign, Clinton is now aligning herself with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2008, Clinton was against same-sex marriage, a supporter of the Second Amendment, and a proponent of her Iraq War vote. Fast forward to 2015, Clinton now supports same-sex couples, advocates for tighter gun control measures, and has admitted that her Iraq War vote was a \"mistake.\"\n\nClinton's stance on free trade has also seen a shift. In 2008, she was a supporter, but during the campaign, she became an opponent, and as Secretary of State, she became a supporter again. However, last week, she announced her opposition to the very Pacific trade deal she championed as the country's top diplomat.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who advised President Obama's bids for the White House, commented on CNN, \"This is a classic political decision that you can flip-flop if you flop over to the popular side of an issue. The great risk, though \u2014 her great liability in this race so far \u2014 has been this sense that she\u2019s been inauthentic. This lurch on this issue opens her up for another charge of inauthenticity.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, plans to capitalize on this perceived inconsistency, particularly on trade. Sanders opposed trade deals with Mexico, Canada, Central America, and China.\n\nClinton's stance on same-sex marriage has been more consistent, though late compared to other Democrats. In 2008, she openly opposed it, offering civil unions as an acceptable compromise. Only after leaving her position as Secretary of State, and as the Supreme Court was considering overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, did Clinton change her stance.\n\nIn the 2008 campaign, Clinton was steadfast in defending her Iraq War vote, a vote that President Obama used to contrast himself. It wasn't until her 2014 book \"Hard Choices\" that Clinton says she \"got it wrong\" on Iraq. This year on the campaign trail, she's gone further, saying her vote was \"a mistake.\"\n\nOn guns, Clinton's moves have been more a matter of what she's emphasizing. In 2008, she criticized Obama's statement that rural Pennsylvanians \"cling to guns or religion\" and portrayed herself as an adherent of the gun culture. Last week, however, in the wake of another mass shooting, Clinton vowed to go further than Obama in taking executive action to limit gun ownership.\n\nOn immigration, Clinton is also revising her previous stance. In 2008, Clinton offered a confusing answer of whether she supported states issuing licenses to illegal immigrants. After the debate, and after then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer withdrew the proposal because of its unpopularity, Clinton made a statement opposing driver's licenses for undocumented people. However, as the power of Hispanic voters increases, Clinton has tailored her stance yet again, now supporting states granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.",
    " Title: A Call for Unity and Recognition of Common Ground in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, Dionne, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist, sheds light on the current state of American politics, suggesting that the traditional policy debates between the two major parties have shifted, with the Republican Party becoming increasingly radicalized. The Republican Party, according to Dionne, now primarily focuses on cutting taxes for the wealthy and deregulating businesses, while the substantive part of many policy debates now takes place within the Democratic Party.\n\nDionne argues that tensions between progressives and moderate Democrats are natural, but both sides could benefit from learning from each other rather than engaging in a \"moralism that feeds political superiority complexes.\" Progressives, Dionne notes, have often felt that Democratic moderates have allowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation, while moderates have focused on creating technocratically elegant policies rather than popular programs.\n\nModerates, on the other hand, argue that every great progressive victory in American history has required compromise in order to persuade allies who disagree on other issues. Dionne suggests that it's not enough to state one's case and wait for a silent progressive majority to emerge.\n\nIn the long run, Dionne argues, each side is likely to accomplish more if they recognize that the other isn't the enemy. In the short term, however, there is an inescapable dilemma: the party can nominate only one person.\n\nBefore the party's nomination, Dionne urges both sides to pause and reflect on the strengths of the other. For progressives, this means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates performed better in swing districts in 2018, and celebrating the progressivism of candidates like Pete Buttigieg's agenda, albeit quietly for now. This call for unity and recognition of common ground is a timely reminder of the importance of collaboration and understanding in American politics.",
    " Title: Former President George H.W. Bush's Funeral and Memorial Services Detailed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn accordance with presidential tradition, the funeral and memorial services for the 41st President of the United States, George H.W. Bush, have been meticulously planned. The schedule was released on Saturday evening, with ceremonies taking place in Houston, Washington D.C., Spring, Texas, and College Station, Texas. Bush passed away on Friday at the age of 94.\n\nIn honor of the late president, President Donald Trump has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, and federal offices will be closed in observance. Trump has also arranged for one of the Boeing 747s that serve as Air Force One to transport Bush's casket from Houston to Washington D.C.\n\nOn Monday, members of both the House and Senate will attend an arrival ceremony at the U.S. Capitol at 4:45 p.m. ET. Bush will lie in state in the rotunda until Wednesday morning.\n\nFamily and friends will then gather at the National Cathedral in Washington for an 11 a.m. funeral service on Wednesday.\n\nBush will be taken to his home of Houston, where he will lie in repose at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston from 7:45 p.m. ET Wednesday until 7 a.m. ET Thursday. The church will also hold a second memorial service for the former president at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a motorcade will transport Bush's body to Union Pacific Railroad Westfield Auto Facility. From there, a funeral train will take Bush to Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, the site of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where he will be laid to rest.\n\nBush will be buried next to his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, who passed away in April, and his daughter Pauline Robinson \"Robin\" Bush, who died in 1953 at the age of 3.\n\nMore details about Bush's funeral arrangements can be found on a tribute website for the former president. The Bush family has requested that those who wish to pay their respects make donations to the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University to \"help ensure that President Bush's legacy of public service with integrity is perpetuated.\"",
    " Title: Wage Stagnation Persists Despite Auto Industry Recovery: Economists Warn of Long-Term Impact on U.S. Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recovery that has seen the resurgence of the American auto industry, wages for workers on the production line have remained stagnant, with minimal growth since 2008. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the average hourly wage has increased by just 42 cents over the past four years to $23.41.\n\nHigh unemployment rates partially account for this trend, but economists argue that wage growth has been surprisingly flat during this recovery period. Sherry Cooper, chief economist and executive vice president at the BMO Financial Group, stated, \"It's unprecedented how modest the wage gains have been over this recovery. It's painful for consumers and detrimental for labor.\"\n\nThe issue has not gone unnoticed, with Mitt Romney's campaign using the stagnant wage growth as a campaign talking point in response to President Barack Obama's statement last week that the \"private sector is doing fine.\" A campaign email sent out on Saturday read, \"Maybe he can ask families whose household income dropped $4,300 if they're 'doing fine.'\"\n\nThe auto industry, a sector Obama often highlights during his campaign trail, has seen a decline in wages for workers building vehicles and parts, despite federal intervention and improving car sales. The average hourly wage for autoworkers in April was $21.65, a decrease of about $1.52 after adjusting for inflation, compared to the same point in 2008. This difference equates to more than $3,000 over the course of a year.\n\nFor Obama, addressing this wage stagnation is a challenge that may take several months to address. Many economists project it will take years before many Americans see wage increases, as the high unemployment rate of 8.2% allows companies to hire at lower wages. Wages will start rising again when unemployment returns to what economists call its \"natural\" rate, between 5% and 6%, the point at which the economy is running at full capacity.\n\nHowever, at this stage in the recovery, low salaries reinforce a cycle that makes the economy fragile. Without additional income, consumers are unable to spend or invest in ways that cause gross domestic product to increase by more than about 2.2% this year. George Mokrzan, director of economics at Ohio-based Huntington National Bank, noted, \"That's why we have modest forecasts instead of strong forecasts.\"",
    " Title: Cruz's Struggle to Unite Evangelical Voters in South Carolina Raises Questions About His Ability to Unify the Conservative Base\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the South Carolina primary, Texas Senator Ted Cruz's bid to unite the conservative base appears to be faltering, as he finished in third place behind Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. This unexpected outcome has cast doubt on Cruz's status as the conservative frontrunner and the candidate that many movement conservatives and evangelical Christians have rallied behind.\n\nAccording to exit polls, 73 percent of voters in South Carolina identified as evangelical. In a state where Cruz had been trying to secure the support of this core group of politically active Christians, the outright winner of the evangelical vote was Trump, who garnered 33 percent of that segment. Cruz took 27 percent of the evangelical vote, followed by Rubio with 22 percent.\n\nPenny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America, expressed her concerns about Cruz's performance in South Carolina. \"It's going to be more difficult for him to make the argument that he's the front-runner, that he's the guy for everyone to coalesce around,\" she said. \"It throws that into question.\"\n\nTimothy Head, the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a prominent Christian group, noted that Cruz has been a stalwart champion for conservative and evangelical issues but acknowledged that the evangelical vote is not solely based on socially conservative issues. \"We're weeks away from seeing an actual coalescence around one candidate,\" he said.\n\nCruz still enjoys significant support from movement conservative leaders, including Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, and James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family. However, the South Carolina results suggest that Cruz's message is not resonating with a broader segment of the evangelical electorate.\n\nLooking ahead to the upcoming contests in Nevada and throughout the South, Cruz urged his supporters to rally to his campaign once again. \"If you are a conservative, this is where you belong, because only one strong conservative is in a position to win this race,\" he said. \"We are the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nHowever, the South Carolina results indicate a more challenging dynamic for Cruz as March 1 nears and a dozen states, many of them Southern, heavily evangelical, and similar to South Carolina, vote in primaries. Cruz's campaign has set high expectations for that day, organizing in the South earlier and harder than any other campaign and claiming they must, and will, have a strong showing.\n\nRubio and Trump also have paths in states politically similar to South Carolina, and Trump, in particular, comes in with a head of steam. As March 1 nears and a dozen states vote, the race for the Republican nomination is likely to remain fragmented, with a splintered electorate unwilling to coalesce around one conservative standard-bearer.",
    " Title: WHO Warns Young People to Exercise Caution Amidst Global Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized that young people are not immune to the coronavirus and must avoid socializing and communicating with older, more vulnerable individuals. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that the choices made by the young can be \"the difference between life and death for someone else.\"\n\nThe global death toll from the Covid-19 respiratory illness has surpassed 11,000 patients. The WHO's remarks come in response to reports of complacency among young people in various countries regarding health warnings, due to the virus's greater susceptibility among older patients.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak was initially recorded in China in December, but it is now predominantly affecting Europe. In Italy, where the virus has claimed more lives than in any other country, the death toll rose by 627 on Friday, reaching a total of 4,032, marking the deadliest day for one country since the outbreak began.\n\nIn response to the escalating crisis, several countries and regions have implemented new measures. The United Kingdom has announced that cafes, pubs, and restaurants will be closed from Friday night. The United States has closed its borders with Mexico and Canada to most traffic, and New York State has ordered non-essential businesses to shut down, a day after a similar move by California. Spain has warned that army patrols will detain people outside without good reason. Bavaria, Germany's second most populous state, has become the first state to impose a lockdown. France has reinforced patrols at Paris railway stations to stop people from taking unnecessary trips. Indonesia will impose a state of emergency in the capital Jakarta from Monday, with bars, cinemas, and many other businesses set to close down.\n\nSpeaking at an online news conference from WHO headquarters in Geneva, Mr. Tedros said, \"Although older people are hardest hit, younger people are not spared.\" He further stated, \"I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don't get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.\"\n\nMr. Tedros welcomed the development from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, which reported no new cases on Thursday. He said this provided \"hope for the rest of the world that even the most severe situation can be turned around.\"\n\nStudies have shown that people of all ages can be infected by the virus, but it is especially dangerous for older people and those with underlying illnesses. The average age of those who died from Covid-19 in Italy was 78.5 years. Fewer than 1% of patients under the age of 50 died in China, according to the New York Times. However, it was fatal for nearly 15% of those who were over the age of 80.\n\nThe WHO is now recommending \"physical distance\" instead of \"social distancing\" to help prevent transmission of the virus. Dr. Maria Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, told the news agency, \"We want people to remain connected.\" She added, \"So find ways to do that, find ways through the internet and through different social media to remain connected because your mental health going through this (pandemic) is just as important as your physical health.\"",
    " Title: \"Impact of Obamacare: Millions of Insurance Policies and Potential Jobs at Risk\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the federal Obamacare exchanges' launch in October 2013, millions of Americans received policy cancellation notices. By the end of the year, over 5 million people had lost their insurance due to Obamacare rendering their plans illegal under the new law.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue, with healthcare experts estimating that nearly 80-100 million private and employer-provided policies could eventually be cancelled as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute predicted that at least half of the people on employer plans would lose their coverage by 2014. With approximately 157 million employer health care policy holders, this could have a significant impact.\n\nAvik Roy of the Manhattan Institute further added that the administration estimated approximately 78 million Americans with employer-sponsored insurance could lose their existing coverage due to the ACA.\n\nLast week, an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute showed that the administration anticipates half to two-thirds of small businesses could have their policies cancelled or be compelled to send workers onto the Obamacare exchanges. The analysis also predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be cancelled next year.\n\nFurthermore, a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggests that the ACA could not only lead to the loss of health plans but also result in the loss of millions of jobs. The CBO report indicates that the ACA could reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent of total hours worked in 2024 relative to what it would have been under prior law.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly before the Super Bowl, President Obama refused to admit that his promise that Americans could keep their health plans under Obamacare was a mistake. Half of voters believe the president knowingly lied about people being able to keep their plans.",
    " Title: GOP Congressmen Call for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Resignation from Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, three Republican congressmen have introduced a resolution calling for the resignation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller from the ongoing Russia collusion investigation. The resolution, introduced on Friday by Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), alleges Mueller's ties to the FBI and its role in controversies involving Russia.\n\nRep. Gaetz, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, stated, \"Evidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and from the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies.\" Gaetz's statement refers to Mueller's supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia's Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company, Uranium One, that controlled a significant portion of American uranium reserves.\n\nThe congressmen are questioning how this deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe, given that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney at the time, and Mueller was FBI director.\n\nGaetz also pointed to the FBI informant, whose gag order was lifted by the Justice Department last week, and is now able to provide information to Congress. Gaetz claims that the Obama administration and Mueller's FBI knowingly kept Congress in the dark about Russia's significant and illegal involvement with American uranium companies by silencing the informant.\n\nRep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have also called for Mueller's resignation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley has called for an independent special counsel to investigate the Obama-era Uranium One deal.\n\nTwo pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, are currently proposed to ensure a judicial check on the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel. The bills are backed by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), along with Democratic senators.\n\nThe proposed resolution comes just days after Mueller's team announced the first charges in their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts, while former Trump foreign policy campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos entered a guilty plea after admitting to making false statements to the FBI.",
    " Title: Graham Urges Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein to Clarify Potential Role in Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter obtained by Fox News, top Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has pressed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to clarify whether he should recuse himself from the ongoing Robert Mueller investigation, due to his own connections to the case.\n\nGraham's letter, dated May 31, questions whether Rosenstein considers himself a \"potential witness\" in the Mueller probe, in light of reports suggesting that the investigation is examining whether President Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. The letter further cites reports that Trump relied on a Rosenstein-authored memo to justify the firing.\n\nThe senator's inquiry follows a New York Times report this week detailing a memo written by ousted FBI official Andrew McCabe, which reportedly described a meeting where Rosenstein claimed Trump had asked him to reference Russia in his recommendation to fire Comey. However, Rosenstein, in response, focused on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet, denied any connection between the firing of Comey and Russia, stating, \"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\"\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the investigation, Trump had wanted Rosenstein to mention that Comey told him he was not under investigation in the Russia case. However, Trump himself has cited the Russia probe in explaining his decision to fire Comey. Any indications that the president was motivated by the Russia investigation to act against Comey could fuel the obstruction of justice component of Mueller's probe.\n\nA DOJ official declined to comment on Graham's letter on Friday. The new pressure on Rosenstein comes as President Trump continues to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his original decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, which handed the reins to Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller after Comey's firing. Trump earlier this week expressed regret over his choice of attorney general.",
    " Title: Kentucky's Criminal Justice Reform Efforts: A Model for the Nation\n\nArticle:\n\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky has called for the nation to learn from his state's efforts to reform its criminal justice system, arguing that the traditional \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" approach has proven ineffective and costly. The United States has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world, with one in three American adults having a criminal record.\n\nIn a bid to address this issue, Bevin has spearheaded several reforms in Kentucky, including the passage of expungement legislation that allows certain nonviolent offenders who have served their sentence and completed a crime-free period to wipe their slates clean. This initiative aims to provide better job opportunities and improved education, and ultimately, reduce recidivism rates.\n\nRecognizing the complexity of the issue, Bevin has also formed a 23-member Criminal Justice Policy Assessment Council, comprising a diverse array of voices, including prosecutors, public defenders, faith-based and business community members, state lawmakers, and local leaders from across the political spectrum. The task force is conducting a thorough review of Kentucky's criminal justice system and recommending reforms that will make it more effective and less costly.\n\nGovernor Bevin, along with governors Nathan Deal of Georgia and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, has also produced a film titled \"Changing Laws, Changing Lives,\" which highlights their desire to see reform and the different approaches their states have taken to address it. The governors aim to learn from each other's experiences and work together to develop plans that minimize the cost to taxpayers, maximize public safety, and motivate offenders to turn away from crime.\n\nBevin's call for reform is part of a growing movement across the country, as states like Georgia and Oklahoma also implement smart justice reforms. The governor hopes that Congress will be inspired by Kentucky's story and follow its lead to pass similar reforms at the federal level. United in their efforts, the governors aim to create a criminal justice system that restores human dignity, promotes rehabilitation, and ultimately, contributes to a safer and more just society.",
    " Title: Fiscal Cliff Bill Averts Medicare Doctor Pay Cuts, Eliminates Long-Term Care Program\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently passed bill, aimed at averting the nation from plunging over the fiscal cliff, has not only halted income tax increases and delayed across-the-board spending cuts but also brought about significant changes to Medicare and other health care programs.\n\nOne of the most prominent health care alterations was the prevention of a substantial pay cut for doctors who treat Medicare patients. David Blumenthal, president of the American College of Physicians and an internist in Cleveland, stated, \"We know that this would really devastate access to seniors, to just cut payment rates by almost 27 percent.\"\n\nThe pay cut, if implemented, would likely lead doctors to stop accepting new Medicare patients and potentially drop existing ones. However, the language in the bill did not meet doctors' expectations, as it only delayed the issue that has been a recurring concern since 2002.\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals are displeased as the so-called \"doc fix\" was partially funded by cutting $15 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments to them over the next 10 years.\n\nIn the short term, doctors are concerned about the potential impact of the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, which could be reintroduced in just eight weeks. David Blumenthal expressed particular worry about the Graduate Medical Education (GME) program, which helps fund the training of young doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.\n\nAnother health care program, the CLASS Act, was eliminated as part of the fiscal cliff deal. Originally part of the 2010 health law, the CLASS Act aimed to provide long-term care insurance at a modest cost. However, the program faced opposition from Republicans, who viewed it as a potentially unlimited government program that could not sustain itself.\n\nLarry Minnix, president of Leading Age, a group of more than 6,000 nonprofit providers of services to seniors and people with disabilities, expressed disappointment over the CLASS Act's elimination. \"Long-term care, in the broadest sense of it, is responsible for people, including families, the 355 days [a year] they're not in the hospital and the 22 hours a day they're not in the doctor's office,\" Minnix said.\n\nMedicare has been a contentious issue in recent budget battles and is expected to be a point of contention in upcoming debates over delayed budget cuts, raising the debt ceiling, and the expiration of last year's temporary spending bills, all before the end of March.\n\nHealth policy analyst Bob Laszewski stated, \"We're going to have three more cliff issues over the next three months.\" He added, \"But we do not even have a Medicare entitlement fix on the table, from either side.\"\n\nThis suggests that the 113th Congress is likely to face a rocky start as they navigate the complexities of Medicare and other health care programs in the coming months.",
    " Title: Rescue Efforts Intensify in Mexico City's Condesa District Following Building Collapse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck Mexico City, buildings also collapsed across the fashionable neighborhood of Condesa, another district known for its vulnerability to seismic activity due to its construction on soft soil. Thousands of people stood in the streets, avenues, and sidewalks, filling the popular neighborhood with a palpable sense of dread.\n\nOn Laredo Street, an eight-story apartment building had crumbled into the road, leaving an enormous pile of concrete and rubble spilling into the street. Over a hundred people stood atop the pile, clearing it by hand, piece by piece, passing boulders and twisted steel pipes along a human chain that radiated from the heap like spokes.\n\nThe air was filled with shouts, men barking orders at one another. A call for silence then rang out - to listen for the voices of anyone trapped inside, crying out for help.\n\nStanding on the sidewalk, Salom\u00f3n Chertorivski, the secretary of economic development for Mexico City, stated that at least 10 people were believed to be trapped inside the structure. The rumble of a backhoe digging into the building's remains and the whir of helicopters overhead dominated the scene. A stretcher was passed up to the top of the heap.\n\n\"Whoever isn't helping, leave,\" one worker shouted to no one in particular.\n\nWitnesses had watched in horror as people tried to escape before the building collapsed.\n\n\"It fell straight down,\" said Moises Escobar, 25, a recent college graduate. \"There was a lot of smoke and dust.\"\n\nWorkers continued their frantic efforts to pull those from the wreckage. A man raced down Amsterdam Street, searching for tools.\n\n\"Saws, hacksaws - anything to cut wood and metal,\" he screamed.\n\nSomeone returned from a nearby building with a hacksaw and handed it to him, and he prepared to sprint back to the mound.\n\n\"I work near here, but we have to help,\" he said. \"It's our country.\"\n\nThat collective spirit filled the disaster site, as neighbors and those passing by joined the rescue efforts.",
    " Title: Grocery Workers Across U.S. Advocate for Enhanced Protections Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus crisis, essential workers, particularly grocery clerks, are demanding more protections as they continue to put themselves at risk. Over 41 grocery workers have died from the virus, according to the Washington Post.\n\nFollowing Minnesota and Vermont's lead, more than a dozen states have provided free, subsidized, or income-dependent child care to grocery workers, bringing the total number of states offering this benefit to 20. However, these workers are calling for further measures to ensure their safety.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers union, along with major supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons, have been advocating for federal and state officials to designate grocery workers as first responders. This would grant them priority access to masks, gloves, and other protective equipment. They are also urging for mandatory guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enforce sanitation, social distancing, and personal protective equipment in grocery stores.\n\nDavid Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, emphasized that the first-responder status is a step in the right direction but is not sufficient to keep them safe. \"Essential workers need more than just masks and gloves,\" he said. \"They need a broad set of protections to enable them to safely go to work.\"\n\nMadland supports the Essential Workers Bill of Rights, proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Ca.), which would mandate protective equipment, sick leave, child care, health care, and a pay raise for essential employees like grocery workers.\n\nAs the federal government has yet to implement meaningful protections, workers' safety is determined by the companies they work for and state and local governments. While grocery workers are being hailed as heroes for their service during the coronavirus crisis, only a handful of states have taken action to provide them with protections from the virus.\n\nSome states, including Delaware and Illinois, have issued guidance for grocery stores to limit the number of customers and enforce social distancing in lines. A growing number are requiring shoppers to wear masks. However, only a handful of states, including Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, are mandating employers to provide grocery workers with personal protective equipment.\n\nMassachusetts has made free, priority coronavirus testing available to grocery workers. California has expanded paid sick time to food sector workers and, along with Nevada and Maryland, granted grocery workers the right to wash their hands every 30 minutes.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve, the need for enhanced protections for essential workers, particularly grocery workers, becomes increasingly urgent. The Essential Workers Bill of Rights, along with similar state-level initiatives, could provide the necessary safeguards to ensure the health and safety of these workers who are vital to maintaining the nation's food supply chain.",
    " Title: Pro-Life Organization Accuses YouTube and Pinterest of Discrimination Over Anti-Abortion Content\n\nArticle:\n\nA leading pro-life organization, Live Action, has taken legal action against YouTube and Pinterest, alleging discrimination against the group's anti-abortion content on both platforms. In a cease and desist letter dated August 21, Live Action's attorneys have demanded that the platforms address the allegations or contact their lawyers by August 30.\n\nThe organization claims that YouTube has failed to publish its video ads, breached contracts, and caused financial losses. Pinterest banned Live Action from its platform in June, citing its \"pro-life educational and political content\" as \"pornographic.\" Live Action's lawyers argue that the decision is a result of \"kneejerk reactions and poorly thought-out pretexts for speech suppression.\"\n\nYouTube has acknowledged receiving the concerns raised by Live Action and is currently investigating the matter. Pinterest has yet to respond to the group's letter. \"Litigation is likely to ensue in this matter,\" the letters state.\n\nLila Rose, Live Action's founder and president, expressed her dismay in a statement, stating, \"It is truly sad and disheartening that in a society built on the principles of freedom of speech and assembly, companies like YouTube and Pinterest, who clearly benefit from these first principles of American culture, are engaging in not-so-subtle tactics to suppress speech with which they disagree.\"\n\nLive Action's attorney, Harmeet Dhillon of the Dhillon Law Group, added, \"The evidence in both of these cases is substantial, ranging from suppression of speech and breach of contract to censorship and banning of Live Action based on false claims.\"\n\nLast week, Live Action made a similar accusation against Facebook, claiming the social media platform's fact-checking mechanism labeled as \"false\" and \"inaccurate\" the group's claim that \"abortion is never medically necessary.\"\n\nRose warned, \"Continued efforts to censor Live Action will have tremendous implications, not only for the pro-life movement, but for free speech in America.\"",
    " Title: Key Constitutional Questions to Be Addressed in Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares for the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, several crucial constitutional issues are expected to be addressed. Kavanaugh, a 53-year-old respected federal judge, has a number of unanswered questions regarding his jurisprudence. Here are five matters that warrant exploration during the hearings:\n\n1. Federal Marijuana Regulation: With recreational marijuana legal in multiple states, the ongoing federal ban on marijuana and the Supreme Court's upholding of this ban in Gonzales v. Raich (2005) is a contentious issue. Kavanaugh will be asked about the federal authority to regulate interstate commerce and whether it is broad enough to ban a local activity that is legal under state law and never crosses state lines.\n\n2. Presidential Executive Orders and Judicial Review: In February 2017, the Trump administration argued that President Trump's first executive order banning travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries was beyond the reach of judicial review. Kavanaugh will be asked about his stance on the deference federal courts should give to the executive branch when the president claims to be acting in the name of national security.\n\n3. Unenumerated Rights: The Constitution lists certain rights, but it also acknowledges rights that are not explicitly listed, such as the right to privacy and the right to gay marriage. Kavanaugh will be asked about the Supreme Court's role in securing unenumerated rights from government infringement and whether the Court should overturn its applicable precedents and stop recognizing the unwritten right to privacy.\n\n4. Judicial Restraint and the Affordable Care Act: In his 2011 dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Kavanaugh argued that the federal courts should have abstained from ruling on the constitutional merits of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Kavanaugh will be asked to explain his criteria for determining when the judiciary should afford great respect to lawmakers and avoid \"upending\" their \"legislative effort.\"\n\n5. Bulk Metadata Collection and the Fourth Amendment: In 2015, Kavanaugh wrote that the National Security Agency's bulk metadata collection program was \"entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\" Kavanaugh will be asked about his current view on this matter and whether he still believes the Fourth Amendment is not violated when the federal government engages in the wholesale warrantless collection of every American's telephone record metadata.\n\nThe American people eagerly await Kavanaugh's responses to these critical constitutional questions during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week.",
    " Title: Democratic Pro-Choice Caucus Announces Support for Bipartisan Medicare Deal Despite Abortion Funding Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement on Tuesday, the Democratic leaders of the House's pro-choice caucus, Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Louise Slaughter of New York, announced their support for a bipartisan deal to overhaul Medicare payments, despite the inclusion of a long-standing ban on using federal funds for abortion.\n\nThe statement aims to salvage the Medicare deal, which was struck by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker John A. Boehner, amidst Senate Democrats' grievances about the so-called Hyde language on abortion and other aspects of the House package.\n\nThe pro-choice caucus chairs assert that the language in the bipartisan compromise does not restrict women's access to abortion and that the provisions expire along with funding, just as the current Hyde Amendment does. They encourage other members of the pro-choice caucus to support this bipartisan compromise.\n\nThe abortion debate centers around a ban on the procedure within funding for community health centers. The abortion issue has already caused a stalemate in a Senate bill aimed at combating human trafficking, and lawmakers from both parties are concerned it will derail the ongoing effort to repeal an outdated Medicare formula known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR).\n\nCongress regularly overrides the SGR cuts, but top Democrats and Republicans have stated it's time to permanently scrap them before April 1, when doctors face a 21% cut in reimbursements.\n\nRep. Michael Burgess, Texas Republican and lead author of the SGR-repeal bill, said this week, \"If someone needs a reason to be against this, I'm sure they can find reasons to be against it. I would rather approach it as, are there reasons to be for it? There's plenty of reasons to be for it.\"\n\nLeading women in the House are hoping their counterparts in both chambers see it the same way, even as they reiterated their distaste for the abortion-funding ban.\n\n\"The Hyde Amendment is a temporary rider that expires every year, and we \u2013 along with many women across this country \u2013 look forward to the day when it will end,\" Ms. DeGette and Ms. Slaughter concluded.",
    " Title: Trump Children's Criticism of Hunter Biden's Business Dealings Draws Attention to Family's Own International Businesses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the sons of President Donald Trump, have found themselves in the spotlight for their criticism of Hunter Biden's international business dealings. The brothers, who manage the Trump Organization on behalf of their father, have been accused of hypocrisy and irony, given their own extensive business dealings across more than 30 countries and about 500 business entities.\n\nOn Wednesday night, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. appeared on Fox News, where they criticized Hunter Biden for his role on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which they claim created conflicts of interest for the Obama administration's foreign policy. However, the specific numbers and details of their accusations have been met with skepticism, and there is no evidence to support their claims.\n\nLeaving aside the dubiousness of the specific numbers and details of the accusations, the Trump sons' business dealings raise questions of their own. Since Trump's inauguration, the Trump Organization has generated about $9.5 billion in revenue, and the sons have been responsible for managing it. In the past few years, they have sold more than $100 million of the family's real estate, including a $3.2 million deal in the Dominican Republic last year, which is considered a clear violation of their father's pledge to do no new foreign deals while in office.\n\nForeign money has also poured into the Trump International Hotel, located just blocks from the White House, which made the president $41 million last year alone. In addition to Ukraine, the Trumps have also been accused of cashing in in China, where Ivanka Trump, despite working in the White House, continues to do business. Last year, Ivanka's husband, White House official Jared Kushner, received a massive cash infusion from Qatar.\n\nThe Trumps' business dealings have not gone unnoticed, and their critics have accused them of profiting from their father's presidency. In back-to-back tweets posted last Thursday, Eric Trump bashed Hunter Biden for his alleged profiteering from corruption, but then in his very next post, he bragged about a new Trump Organization development in Scotland.\n\nIn short, the Trumps' business dealings have raised questions about their commitment to their father's pledge to do no new foreign deals while in office. The news moves fast, and it remains to be seen how this development will impact the 2020 election.",
    " Title: Trump Seizes Tax-Cut Issue, Promises to Revitalize U.S. Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed push for economic growth and tax reform, President Donald Trump has taken the lead in advocating for a comprehensive tax-cut plan. The president, in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, declared that the \"era of economic surrender is over,\" emphasizing the potential benefits of his proposed tax reforms.\n\nThe Trump tax plan includes significant reductions in both large and small business tax rates, a doubling of the standard deduction for middle-income individuals, the elimination of unnecessary deductions, the repeal of the death tax, and the abolition of the alternative minimum tax.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the president's plan as a handout to the wealthy, but Trump has called for a bipartisan approach to tax cuts, citing the success of previous tax cuts during the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. He has also emphasized the historical precedent of bipartisan support for tax cuts, such as those passed during Reagan's presidency.\n\nHowever, key points in the Trump plan require clarification. One such point is the argument that the U.S. is destined for 2% or less growth, known as \"secular stagnation.\" This argument is dismissed as nonsense, as across-the-board tax cuts during the JFK period produced 5% annual growth, and real growth averaged 4.6% for the remainder of Reagan's presidency.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have suggested a 3% growth scenario, arguing that it will pay for the tax cuts. However, naysayers remain skeptical, refusing to acknowledge the impact of tax-rate incentives.\n\nOne example of the incentive effect of the Trump tax plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. This change would result in a business keeping 80 cents for every additional dollar earned, compared to the current 65 cents. This significant incentive reward is expected to have a substantial impact on business decisions.\n\nThe Trump plan also includes the repatriation of trillions of U.S. company dollars currently held overseas to avoid taxes, as well as 100% expensing write-offs for new investment of any kind. On the individual side, the doubling of the standard deduction is a key aspect of the plan, particularly beneficial for young millennials and those without mortgages or homes.\n\nThe Republican party is urged to seize this opportunity for tax reform, with the potential for increased prosperity for American workers and families, as well as enhanced strength overseas. The GOP is cautioned not to let archaic process rules prevent the implementation of good policy, and to approach the tax reform process with determination, as JFK, Reagan, and now Trump have done before them.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's National Security Speech: A Mixed Bag of Old and New Ideologies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of 2016, speculations about potential presidential candidates are rife. Among them, Mitt Romney and Rand Paul have been making headlines. Recently, Senator Rand Paul unveiled his national security platform, titled \"Conservative Realism,\" in a speech in New York. The speech, while showing signs of a shift in Paul's traditional isolationist stance, is met with mixed reactions, indicating a superficial attempt at reinvention that masks deeper issues.\n\nThe speech, in places, seemed to reverse some of Paul's key beliefs, such as acknowledging the necessity of U.S. engagement in global affairs. However, the omission of crucial topics like Israel, immigration, and NSA privacy rights, among others, is puzzling.\n\nWhile Paul's praise for the U.S. forces' post-9/11 success in Afghanistan and his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the Libya intervention are understandable, the speech as a whole fails to present a coherent new plan or a clear departure from Paul's non-interventionist stance.\n\nThe speech's most questionable aspect is its handling of the global jihadist threat. In the wake of recent attacks in Canada and New York, one would expect a robust and unambiguous response. Instead, Paul offered a vague statement about the world having a \"dignity problem,\" rather than acknowledging the Islamist ideology that underlies much of the global terrorism we face today.\n\nThis newfound concern for the downtrodden of the world seems disingenuous, as it appears to be a veiled criticism of U.S. foreign aid, implying that America is to blame for jihadi terrorism. This argument, if taken at face value, negates the responsibility of the jihadists and reinforces the White House's counterterrorism strategy, which is criticized for its disregard of ideology in the war on terror.\n\nSenator Paul's speech, in essence, seems to channel the ideologies of Noam Chomsky and Alex Jones, further raising questions about his presidential potential. Sebastian Gorka, the Matthew C. Horner Distinguished Chair of Military Theory at the Marine Corps University and National Security Affairs Editor for Breitbart.com, has been vocal in his criticism of Paul's speech, questioning its coherence and its adherence to traditional conservative values.",
    " Title: Politico Corrects Article on Trump's Alleged Debt to Bank of China\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent update, Politico has corrected an article that initially claimed President Donald Trump currently owed millions of dollars to the Bank of China. The publication was forced to revise its story after it was determined that Trump did not currently owe the Bank of China millions of dollars, as the Bank of China had sold its debt on the property weeks after the 2012 loan.\n\nThe updated article now reads that Trump \"owed\" - past tense - money to the Bank of China. It includes an important note from the Bank of China as well.\n\nAccording to the updated article, the Bank of China stated that several financial institutions, including the Bank of China, participated in a commercial mortgage loan of $950 million to Vornado Realty Trust in November 2012. The loan was securitized and sold into the commercial mortgage-backed securities market within 22 days, as is a common practice in the industry. The Bank of China has not had any ownership interest in that loan since late November 2012.\n\nThe initial article, which was published before the correction, was criticized for its inaccuracies and was shared by Joe Biden's presidential campaign director of rapid response. Despite the correction, Politico did not retract the article.\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, a Politico spokesperson defended the report, stating that the Trump Organization is a party to a loan that includes the Bank of China, based on multiple publicly available documents. The spokesperson also noted that the loan and the Bank of China's participation in the financing of the property at 1290 Avenue of the Americas is part of the public record.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson acknowledged that after publication, the Bank of China's NY-based PR representative called, stating that the Bank had sold that debt shortly after the 2012 deal. The updated article and headline reflected this new reporting, and the changes were prominently flagged atop the article.\n\nDespite the correction, the article still tries to connect Trump's response to the novel coronavirus, suggesting that the Trump campaign has increased its focus on portraying Biden as weak on China amid rising voter disapproval of China, the source of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFinance experts have told Politico that the documents provided to them were complex and didn't necessarily reveal who currently holds that debt, including the Bank of China. The 2017 filing with the city of New York still lists them as a creditor. Politico will continue to report on this story.",
    " Title: Essential Service Workers in Dallas County Continue Operations Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic, Prioritizing Safety and Health\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Dallas County enforces a shelter-in-place order, essential service workers such as plumbers, HVAC technicians, and electricians are continuing to enter the homes of residents, relying on customers to maintain safety protocols.\n\nKeresa Richardson, co-owner of Benjamin Franklin Plumbing in Dallas, emphasizes the historical role of plumbers in safeguarding public health. \"Plumbers, historically, protect the health of the nation,\" Richardson said, \"and we continue to do so by providing services when everyone else is quarantined. We\u2019re still out there doing our job.\"\n\nRichardson and her husband, J.R., run Lawton Group, a conglomerate that includes Benjamin Franklin Plumbing, Buckaroo Pest Protection, Lawton Mechanical Services, and other companies providing mechanical services. Richardson notes that their employees are accustomed to working in unhealthy environments and have undergone a series of vaccinations to protect themselves.\n\nWith nearly 150 employees, Benjamin Franklin Plumbing is continuing operations, but the company is asking customers to disclose if anyone in the home is feeling ill or showing symptoms related to COVID-19. \"We want to make sure that if there is anyone quarantined, we\u2019re not putting our employees at risk,\" said Richardson.\n\nBaker Brothers, another essential service provider, is also relying on customers to notify them if they are sick to avoid potential coronavirus transmission. CEO Jimmy Dale said that the company has not yet had to deny service to a customer, but decisions will be made by management to ensure the safety of both workers and customers. If a customer reports that someone in the household is sick when calling to request services, the company will first try to reschedule the job depending on what is being requested.\n\nDale has given employees permission to refuse service at the door if they feel customers aren\u2019t forthcoming about any potential illness in the household or they\u2019re uncomfortable about a job for any reason. Baker Brothers' 273 employees are working remotely where possible, with technicians making house calls going straight to service calls from their homes and calling in for weekly team meetings.\n\nThe company has instructed workers to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when they go into homes. They\u2019re maintaining six feet of space between themselves and customers, wearing protective gear including face shields and gloves, and disinfecting equipment between every job.\n\nEmployees at Dallas-Fort Worth-based Berkeys Air Conditioning, Plumbing & Electrical are keeping their distance at customers' doors and performing touchless payment transactions for jobs, according to President Jamie Wooldridge. \"We can actually send an invoice to the customer and they can pay for it then,\" said Wooldridge. \"And if that\u2019s not feasible, then we have them read us the credit card number instead of passing it back and forth.\"\n\nIf a customer tells the company they\u2019re under quarantine or exhibiting symptoms associated with coronavirus, they\u2019re asking them to reschedule services for a later date. The shelter-in-place order, which affects more than 2 million Dallas County residents, is also putting an abnormal strain on home plumbing systems, according to several plumbing company executives.\n\nThere has been an uptick in service calls for clogged plumbing, likely due to residents flushing products other than toilet paper. \"A lot of times we don\u2019t realize we have five people in the house, but you only have two people in at a time,\" said Dale. \"All day long, five people being there kind of creates that.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve had a big uptick in drain calls,\" Dale said. Baker Brothers saw twice as many service requests for clogged plumbing on a typical Monday compared to a normal Monday, he said. Benjamin Franklin plumbers have even started leaving a roll of complimentary toilet paper at the homes they service due to the ongoing toilet paper shortage.\n\n\"With a toilet paper shortage, they are flushing baby wipes, paper towels, Kleenex, whatever they can find to use if they\u2019ve run out of toilet paper,\" said Richardson. \"That clogs the system because those are not meant to disintegrate like toilet paper.\"",
    " Title: Treasury Department Denies Delay in Stimulus Checks Amidst Allegations of President Trump's Name Addition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Washington Post published an article on Tuesday evening suggesting that the stimulus checks being sent to millions of Americans as a result of the coronavirus crisis are being delayed due to the addition of President Donald Trump's name to them. However, the Treasury Department has denied any such delay, stating that the checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned.\n\nThe Washington Post's article, written by Lisa Rein, claims that adding Trump's name to the checks could lead to a delay of a few days. The article also includes quotes from career officials stating that a programming change is necessary to include the president's name, leading to a potential delay in issuing the first batch of paper checks.\n\nHowever, a Treasury Department spokeswoman has denied any delay and stated that the Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned, with no delay whatsoever. The spokeswoman also confirmed that President Trump's name will appear on the paper checks, adding that there will be no delay to make that happen.\n\nMonica Crowley, the Treasury Department spokeswoman, also tweeted a response to the \"inaccurate and misleading\" Washington Post story on Wednesday.\n\nMost Americans are receiving these cash payments directly deposited into their bank accounts, if they have gotten a tax return in recent years and the IRS has their direct deposit information on file. Some Americans, however, need a paper check to be mailed to them, and the Treasury Department says these checks are going out ahead of schedule, even with the addition of President Trump's name on them.\n\nDespite the Washington Post's claims collapsing under scrutiny, many on the left and throughout the media and entertainment establishment have used this story to further attack President Trump. Tweets from prominent figures such as Laurence Tribe, Chris Lu, Jill Wine-Banks, and others have criticized the president for allegedly delaying the checks to have his name added.\n\nHowever, a source familiar with the matter told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the political attacks on the president and inaccurate claims of a delay in checks going out are par for the course for those who oppose President Trump.\n\n\"This is just another attempt by the entrenched, anti-Trump bureaucracy to craft a false narrative about the president's ego when in fact millions of Americans are already seeing their economic impact payments hit their bank accounts,\" the source said. \"The Washington Post is the propaganda arm of the out of touch, rabid, far left and should be lambasted for sowing discord as our nation attempts to navigate this challenging economic climate. Shameful.\"",
    " Title: Fiscal Cliff Negotiations: Stalemate Continues as Both Sides Criticize Each Other's Proposals\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - The ongoing negotiations to avoid the fiscal cliff have hit a roadblock, with both parties criticizing each other's proposals. According to a top Republican Hill aide, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's plan presented to GOP leaders yesterday was described as \"absurd.\" An aide to House Speaker Boehner labeled the White House's offer as \"completely unrealistic\" and \"a break with reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a top Democratic insider expressed frustration, telling ABC's Jonathan Karl that \"the Republicans have taken to screaming at us.\" Sources familiar with the phone call between Speaker Boehner and President Obama on Wednesday night, which lasted 30 minutes, described it as \"unproductive\" and \"blunt.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, at a press conference yesterday, stated, \"No substantive progress has been made over the last two weeks. It's time for the president and Congressional Democrats to tell the American people what spending cuts they're really willing to make.\"\n\nWith just 33 days remaining before the end-of-the-year fiscal cliff deadline, President Obama is taking his case to the public. Today, he will tour a toy manufacturing facility in Hatfield, Pa., and speak to workers there. According to the White House, the President will highlight the potential impact of taxes going up on 98 percent of Americans at the end of the year on a business that depends on middle-class consumers during the holiday season.\n\nThe White House and the Speaker's office have provided their perspectives on the current state of the negotiations. Boehner's office has outlined six reasons why the Obama administration's fiscal cliff offer won't fly, including the proposal's alleged double tax increase, lack of bipartisan support, unbalanced approach, no net spending cuts, the unrealistic idea of permanently doing away with the debt limit, and the offer being an unreasonable opening bid.\n\nOn the other hand, White House spokesman Josh Earnest stated, \"The only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates.\" Earnest added that the President has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and is willing to compromise, urging Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of voices supporting a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, both parties continue to exchange criticisms, and it remains to be seen whether a deal can be reached to avoid the fiscal cliff and its potential economic consequences.",
    " Title: Federal Investigation Intensifies as Wife of Orlando Nightclub Shooter Faces Potential Charges, FBI Probes Ties to Radical Islam and Terrorist Networks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, federal authorities are working tirelessly to unravel the events leading up to the attack and potential accomplices. The wife of the gunman, Noor Salman, is under investigation and could face charges as early as Wednesday, according to a federal law enforcement source.\n\nThe FBI is conducting a comprehensive probe to determine if Omar Mateen, the shooter, acted alone or if others were aware of his deadly intentions and may have aided him. Salman, who is reportedly cooperating with the authorities, is a key focus of the investigation.\n\nFBI agents have interviewed Salman, who is the only known link to Mateen, having been listed as his wife on a 2013 mortgage document and family members who claim the two were married and have a 3-year-old son. The FBI has declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe FBI is also scrutinizing Mateen's radical Islam roots, with two trips to Saudi Arabia in 2011 and 2012 raising concerns. These trips, which were reportedly for the Muslim pilgrimage of umrah, have led experts to question whether Mateen may have received terror training during these trips.\n\nThe FBI has seized a computer, camera, and other equipment from Mateen's Fort Pierce condominium, located approximately 120 miles from the crime scene. The exact role of ISIS in the attack remains unclear, with some reports suggesting Mateen may have received inspiration from the terrorist group, while others indicate a more direct connection.\n\nFox News reported Tuesday that Mateen had a complex relationship with American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha, who detonated a 16-ton bomb in a Syrian government facility in 2014 on behalf of the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. The two reportedly frequented the same Fort Pierce mosque.\n\nAuthorities are also investigating Mateen's ties to Dwayne Robertson, a former New York gang leader who resurfaced in Orlando as an imam and is suspected of radicalizing Americans and sending them abroad to commit acts of terror. Robertson, who was released from prison last year, denies inciting violent jihad.\n\nAs the investigation continues, more information is emerging about Mateen's personality and potential motivations. Relatives and acquaintances describe him as an angry and volatile individual with conflicting feelings towards the LGBT community, the target of his deadly rampage. Despite this, his first wife reportedly believes Mateen was a closeted gay man.\n\nPatrons at Pulse, the nightclub where he killed dozens, recall seeing Mateen there frequently, with one reporting that Mateen had contacted him using a dating app popular within the gay community. The investigation into this tragic event continues, with authorities working to piece together the complex web of connections and motivations behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses Racial Controversy Surrounding LA Clippers Owner, Responds to Racially Charged Events Throughout His Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a familiar response to a racially charged event, President Barack Obama addressed the controversial comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling during a press conference in Malaysia over the weekend. The President's response, as the nation's first black president, has been a topic of discussion among historians and political analysts, who question the unique role he plays in addressing racial issues.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, notes that Obama is often in the position of having to respond to racially charged events. \"He's always in this position,\" Zelizer said. \"Does he have some special obligation to tackle the issue of race? Is it better politically for him to stay out? Is it something he shouldn't be obligated to deal with, just because he's a black president?\"\n\nIn this latest case, Obama did not speak out unbidden. He responded to a question about the comments made by Sterling, who is alleged to have told his girlfriend not to bring black people to his team's games. The identities of those speaking on the tape have not been confirmed, but Obama referred to the comments as those \"the owner is reported to have made.\"\n\nObama did not mince words when addressing the issue, stating, \"I don't think I have to interpret those statements for you; they kind of speak for themselves.\" He went on to say, \"When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk.\"\n\nThe President also sought to put the incident in a larger context, noting that while the United States continues to wrestle with a legacy of slavery and segregation, it is evolving in a positive direction. \"We've made enormous strides, but you're going to continue to see this percolate up every so often,\" Obama said. \"And I think that we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of why some statements like this stand out so much is because there has been this shift in how we view ourselves.\"\n\nFor Obama, this latest episode is more than a teachable moment, according to Zelizer. \"It's a leadership moment,\" he said.\n\nHowever, every time racial matters rise to the top of public discourse, there is an additional dimension for Obama. \"Will he alienate white working-class and middle-class Democrats by talking too much about this?\" Zelizer asks. \"Maybe with a liberal white Democrat, it wouldn't be as much of an issue.\"\n\nIn July 2009, Obama stepped into the middle of the Gates controversy when he responded to a reporter's question about the police's treatment of Henry Louis Gates Jr., an African-American professor at Harvard University. In 2012, the racially charged killing of Trayvon Martin also spurred comments from Obama, who said the black Florida teen could have been his son.\n\nDuring the recent flap over Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who made racist comments about blacks and slavery, Obama has remained silent. On policy matters, Obama also picks his spots. After the US Supreme Court's recent ruling on affirmative action, in which the court upheld a Michigan referendum banning the practice in admissions to public universities, the White House press secretary issued a nuanced reaction. Obama himself said nothing.\n\nBut the President has been vocal on voting rights, such as last June, when the Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voting Rights Act. He and his attorney general have also spoken out on voter ID laws, saying they pose an undue hardship on minority voters.\n\nIn February, Obama unveiled \"My Brother's Keeper,\" an initiative that pulls together foundation and corporate money to help young men of color avoid the \"school to prison pipeline.\" From one perspective, the effort reflected a growing boldness by the President in tackling minority issues. However, some African-American scholars dismissed it as ineffectual because it did not involve an infusion of federal resources.\n\nLester Spence, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is one such scholar. He describes Obama as having a \"voice in his head\" that tells him to avoid discussing race, and decries what he sees as a lack of boldness by Obama. \"If he had listened to that voice in 2007, he never would have run in the first place,\" says Spence. \"So the whole critique that he's walking a tightrope is self-serving to the President, and it blatantly ignores the role of history and creative endeavor in political struggle.\"\n\nAfter the alleged Sterling comments burst into the public arena, Spence wrote a blog post with several observations on the matter. Obama does not merit a mention. Spence says he doesn't necessarily see Obama as having a role in the issue. But Obama was asked what he thought, and he responded. \"So he said something, but what does that something mean, given what happened?\" Spence says. \"Would I have expected Obama to say something transformative? The answer is no.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's New Term to Address Abortion, Gun Rights, and Gay Rights Among Other Controversial Issues\n\nThe upcoming term of the Supreme Court is expected to be marked by significant decisions on a range of contentious issues that have divided American society. Among these issues are abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the separation of church and state, immigration, presidential power, and the structure of the presidential election system.\n\nThe Supreme Court, traditionally, has sought to avoid major controversies during election years. However, with a conservative majority on the court and several closely contested cases, the justices may not be able to escape their responsibility to make final decisions.\n\nThe retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a centrist conservative, has left a vacancy that may be filled by a more hard-line conservative, such as Chief Justice John Roberts or Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The disagreement among the justices on the right of the court has been, according to SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein, \"How fast do you move?\"\n\nOne of the most anticipated cases this term is a challenge to a Texas law that makes it difficult for clinics that perform abortions to operate. The court has agreed to hear arguments in a case that presents a nearly identical law from Louisiana. Goldstein expects the conservative court majority to eventually reverse Roe v. Wade outright or to hollow it out.\n\nOn the issue of gun rights, the court is set to hear the first major test of gun regulations in over a decade. The justices are expected to expand gun rights, as the new conservative majority is likely to overturn previous decisions that limited gun ownership.\n\nThe court is also set to hear cases involving the separation of church and state, with religious rights advocates poised to challenge provisions in most state constitutions that bar direct or indirect aid to religious schools.\n\nAnother hot-button issue is the question of whether employers are free to fire employees because they are gay or transgender. The court will hear a case that tests whether the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars such discrimination.\n\nImmigration cases, particularly the Trump administration's attempt to roll back the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, are also on the docket.\n\nThe court is also set to hear a case that could involve the 2020 election, testing the constitutionality of \"faithless elector\" laws, which impose penalties on Electoral College delegates who refuse to vote for the presidential candidate of their designated party.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decisions on these issues will have far-reaching implications for American society and could significantly reshape the political landscape in the coming years.",
    " Title: Coca-Cola Explores Potential Entry into CBD-Infused Beverage Market\n\nArticle:\n\nCoca-Cola, the world-renowned beverage company, is reportedly considering a move into the burgeoning market for cannabis-infused drinks, specifically those containing CBD, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Coca-Cola (KO) acknowledged that it is \"closely watching\" the growth of CBD as an ingredient in what it terms \"functional wellness beverages.\" The company clarified that no decisions have been made at this time.\n\nCBD, which does not produce a high for the user, has been used for medical purposes, including easing inflammation, pain, and nausea. The interest in CBD-infused beverages comes as the cannabis industry continues to expand, with several companies already trading on US stock exchanges.\n\nThe news was first reported by Bloomberg, which suggested that Coca-Cola is in talks with Aurora Cannabis, a Canadian cannabis company. Aurora Cannabis has also expressed interest in cannabis drinks. Neither company would comment on a possible deal.\n\nAurora spokesperson Heather MacGregor commented, \"There is so much happening in this area right now and we think it has incredible potential.\" She added, \"Stories like this are further validation of the massive global potential of the cannabis industry.\"\n\nConstellation Brands, the maker of Corona beer, Svedka vodka, and Casa Noble tequila, announced last month that it is investing an additional $4 billion in the Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth (CGC).\n\nBoth cannabis and CBD are still illegal in the United States under federal law, even though a number of states have legalized marijuana. However, the prohibition against CBD is not strictly enforced, with third-party sellers offering CBD-based products on Amazon, for example.\n\nKris Krane, president of 4Front, a firm that advises companies on the legalities of marijuana and an expert on cannabis law, suggested that Coca-Cola would likely develop the product first for sale in Canada, preparing it for the US market once it's legal.\n\nBonnie Herzog, analyst with Wells Fargo, noted that Coca-Cola could be well-positioned to capture market share should CBD and other marijuana products become legal. She estimated that cannabis-infused drinks could become a $50 billion annual market in the United States\u2014nearly half the size of the $117 billion market for US beer sales.\n\nBoth Coca-Cola and rival Pepsico have been trying to expand their businesses beyond traditional soft drinks as people drink less soda due to health concerns. Just last week, Coca-Cola announced a deal to buy Costa Coffee for $5 billion.\n\nCanada is in the process of legalizing recreational use of marijuana. The drug is still illegal under US federal law, although some states have decriminalized it. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the epilepsy treatment Epidiolex, the first cannabis-based drug allowed in the United States, which includes CBD as well.",
    " Title: President Trump's Tweet on Minneapolis Protests Sparks Controversy Over Violence and Free Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the second night of protests in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to express his concerns over the ongoing violence and looting in the city. His tweets, which have since been flagged by Twitter for violating the platform's rules about glorifying violence, have sparked a debate over free speech, the role of social media companies, and the nature of the protests themselves.\n\nIn one tweet, Trump wrote, \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump wrote, \"I can\u2019t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.\"\n\nTwitter's response to the tweets was to label them as violating the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, the company also stated that the tweets may remain accessible due to their public interest.\n\nThe controversy over Trump's tweets has reignited concerns from conservatives that social media companies, including Twitter, are biased and selectively enforce their rules. Some argue that the tweets do not glorify violence, but rather reflect the president's response to a dangerous and chaotic situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the protests in Minneapolis continue, with looting and violence escalating on the third night. The city's mayor, Jacob Frey, has faced criticism for his handling of the situation, with some arguing that he has not done enough to quell the violence and restore order.\n\nThe White House has since released a statement, saying, \"The President did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it. @ Jack and Twitter's biased, bad-faith 'fact-checkers' have made it clear: Twitter is a publisher, not a platform.\"\n\nThe debate over free speech and the role of social media companies in moderating content continues to rage on, as the situation in Minneapolis remains volatile and uncertain.",
    " Title: Border Patrol Union Leader Criticizes National Guard Deployment as 'Colossal Waste of Resources'\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the leader of the National Border Patrol Union, Brandon Judd, has criticized the deployment of National Guard troops to the Mexican border, describing it as a \"colossal waste of resources.\" According to the Los Angeles Times, Judd, who is also the president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents 15,000 members, stated, \"We generally support the administration, but we're not going to be cheerleading when things are not going well.\"\n\nJudd expressed that the current deployment of troops to the border is not following the same pattern as similar deployments under the Obama or Bush administrations. He explained, \"They were allowed to do a lot more than they are under the Trump administration.\" Judd further elaborated that during previous administrations, troops were permitted to perform tasks such as manning lookout and observation posts, grading roads, and mending fences, which he claims has not been the case under the Trump administration.\n\nUnion spokesman Chris Cabrera echoed Judd's sentiments, stating that the troops are currently stationed far from the border and are required to work alongside agents, creating additional work and not freeing up agents for patrols as intended.\n\nIn response, an unnamed Pentagon official told the LA Times that state governors determine the terms of how the National Guard troops are used at the border. The Pentagon official disagreed with Judd's characterization of the National Guard's usage, stating, \"It hasn't been a significant change under George Bush, Obama, and now Trump. They're different in how they're perceived. They're no different in what they're doing.\"\n\nActing Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost, however, argued that the National Guard presence does free up some agents. Typically, pairs of agents operate aerostat blimps to monitor the border remotely, and now troops can replace one person on those teams, freeing up agents to be on the front line.\n\nHomeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman stated that the operation is not yet at full capacity, with more troops on the way after a third request for assistance was recently approved. President Donald Trump's plan called for 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops from nearby states to support Border Patrol operations.",
    " Title: Rescue of Trapped Thai Soccer Team Continues Amidst Monsoon Season Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nMAE SAI, Thailand \u2013 The world breathed a collective sigh of relief on Sunday as four young soccer players were successfully rescued from a treacherous, flooded cave in Thailand, marking the beginning of an international effort that has captivated global attention. However, the story of courage, danger, and resilience is far from over, as eight boys, ages 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach remain trapped more than 2 miles into the earth.\n\nSporadic, heavy rainfall continues to complicate the rescue mission, as Thailand's monsoon season gains traction. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn announced that further rescues would be temporarily halted for 10-20 hours to allow dive teams to rest and to restock the Tham Luang cave complex with oxygen and other necessary equipment. The governor did not disclose the condition of the four rescued boys.\n\n\"After 16 days of waiting, we get to see the faces of the Wild Boars,\" he said to applause at the site in Thailand's northern Chiang Rai province. \"It's more successful than I expected, and everyone's happy.\"\n\nThe rescue operation, which began early Sunday morning, saw the first boy emerge at 5:40 p.m. local time, less than eight hours after the operation started. The other three boys were extracted over the next two hours. Those in the best condition were extracted first. The boys were placed in ambulances and given medical assessments before being transported, some via helicopters, to Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital, more than 30 miles away.\n\n\"We can have good dreams tonight,\" the Thai navy SEALs wrote in a post on Facebook.\n\nThe boys and their coach entered the cave complex on June 23 for a soccer practice. Heavy rains flooded some of the narrow tunnels, trapping them. Water levels inside the cave dropped by about a foot on Saturday and were at their lowest levels since the team became trapped. Rescuers are now able to walk deep into the cave, all the way to the \"third chamber,\" about a mile from where the boys are.\n\nAn Australian doctor with cave diving experience examined the boys on Sunday and declared them fit for the operation, authorities said.\n\n\"Today is D-Day,\" Narongsak said as the effort began. \"The boys are healthy, aware, and ready to come out.\"\n\nNarongsak emphasized that there is no time limit on the rescue and that its progress will depend on weather and conditions inside the cave, but it is expected to last through Monday.\n\n\"If something changes, we'll stop,\" he said. \"But I expect the operation to finish within the next couple of days.\"\n\nEarly Sunday morning, all media and nonessential staff were cleared from the cave site as divers, medics, and military began moving into place. Dark clouds and fog shrouded the area around the cave as a steady rain began falling in the early afternoon.\n\nThe boys were calm and reassuring in handwritten notes to their families that were transported by divers and made public on Saturday. One of the boys, identified as Tun, wrote, \"Mom and Dad, please don't worry, I am fine. I've told Yod to get ready to take me out for fried chicken. With love.\"\n\nResidents of the nearby town of Mae Sai, directly on the border with Myanmar about 7 miles away from the cave entrance, follow the saga of the boys' disappearance and rescue efforts intently.\n\n\"We are talking about it all the time,\" said hotel worker Napattra Chokumpompan, 21.\n\n\"I watch the news on my phone, my mom is watching on TV,\" said Chokumpompan, who graduated from the same school that six of the boys attend, Mae Si Prasitsart School. \"They are all of our students, all of our friends, all of our children.\"",

The podcast, available for download on iTunes, via RSS feed, or through the media player above, features insights from media practitioners and academic scholars who have dared to wade into the media-bias debate.\n\nNotable guests include Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter, Juan Williams, and Andrew Rosenthal, the editorial page editor at The New York Times. The episode aims to move beyond personal opinions, seeking empirical evidence to understand the extent and direction of media bias, as well as its purpose.\n\nSteve Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, highlights the challenges in measuring media bias: \"Measuring media bias is a really difficult endeavor because unlike what economists usually study, which are numbers and quantities, media bias is all expressed in words.\"\n\nOne of the empirical works on media bias that we discuss is a 2004 paper by Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo. Their analysis, which served as the launching point for Groseclose's book \"Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind,\" estimates media outlets' political leanings based on the think tanks they mention in their stories.\n\nGroseclose and Milyo's findings reveal that most media outlets lean left, with the Wall Street Journal being the most liberal, even surpassing the New York Times. Fox News is one of the few outlets that are right of center.\n\nWe also present a chart of 20 major media outlets' slant scores, with 100 representing the most liberal and zero the most conservative. The chart is as follows:\n\n1. ABC Good Morning America - 56.1\n2. ABC World News Tonight - 61.0\n3. CBS Early Show - 66.6\n4. CBS Evening News - 73.7\n5. CNN NewsNight with Aaron Brown - 56.0\n6.

    " Title: Senate Confirms Tom Price as Health and Human Services Secretary, Sparking Debate Over Medicare and Ethics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services during a 2 a.m. vote on Friday. The vote was 52-47, with no Democratic senator supporting Price.\n\nThe confirmation came after Price overcame an initial procedural hurdle on Wednesday evening along party lines. With the Republican Party holding a 52-seat majority in the Senate, Democrats do not have the manpower to block any nominees on their own.\n\nHowever, Democrats signaled early on that Price would be a top target due to his support for dismantling the Affordable Care Act and overhauling Medicare. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized the confirmation, stating, \"Make no mistake: In the dark hours of the early morning, with the confirmation of Secretary Price, the Republicans launch the first assault in the war on seniors.\"\n\nDemocrats argue that Price's positions are out of line with President Trump's campaign promises, including his pledge not to cut entitlement programs. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Price, who has previously backed privatizing Medicare, the \"exact opposite\" of what Trump campaigned on.\n\nPrice, who was chairman of the House Budget Committee when nominated, has a history of advocating for changes to Medicare. In late 2016, he stated that Republicans would move to overhaul Medicare within six to eight months of Trump's inauguration. He also supported a proposal in 2015 to reduce Medicare costs by delivering benefits through a voucher program.\n\nThe confirmation battle has also been marked by allegations of stock trading improprieties. CNN and Time reported last month that Price had invested in health-related companies shortly before introducing or supporting legislation that benefited them. Price denied wrongdoing, adding that he made the investments through a broker.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Price's disqualification, stating, \"He should have withdrawn his nomination weeks ago, and if he didn't go voluntarily, the president and his friends in Congress should have quietly but forcefully pushed him out.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported last month that Price received a 12 percent discount on his purchase of biomedical stock.\n\nRepublicans have not wavered in their support for Price, viewing his confirmation as key to aligning with the White House on the plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump and congressional Republicans have at times struggled to agree on a timeline for repealing the ACA or how to replace it.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) stated on Thursday that he hopes confirming Price will speed up the process. \"After seven years we've got all kinds of great ideas, but we have to come together behind one,\" he told reporters.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) praised Price as the \"right man\" for the job, stating, \"Price knows more about health care policy than just about anyone. He doesn't just understand health care policy as a policy maker...he also understands it as a practicing physician. He gets the real-world impact.\"",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Remain Silent as Sequester Deadline Approaches, White House Summit Scheduled for Friday\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the looming budget deadline of Friday fast approaches, a potential sequester crisis remains unresolved in Washington, with no signs of urgency from either side. Unlike previous budget standoffs, there have been no late-night negotiations or last-minute breakthroughs in closed-door meetings.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have not spoken since Thursday, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Boehner have not met since January 21. However, Obama has called for a meeting on Friday at the White House with Boehner, Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). This meeting is scheduled for the same day that the sequester is set to take effect, but it is unlikely to prevent the spending cuts from occurring.\n\nThe across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, which Obama had previously stated would not happen, and Boehner had promised his members he and Senate leadership would work to avoid, will indeed take place. Instead of narrowing the gap in these final days, the sides are moving further apart.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama visited Newport News, Va., and called for closing tax loopholes to offset the cuts. In contrast, Boehner, in a speech to the Credit Union National Association, stated, \"Yes, we should close loopholes, but we should do it as part of tax reform that lowers rates and helps create jobs.\"\n\nThe Senate plans to pass a bill this week to increase taxes on high-income earners. If it manages to pass the Senate and the likely 60-vote threshold, it still will not pass the House. Boehner stated that the House should not have to pass its sequester replacement bill again before the Senate \"gets off their ass\" and passes a bill.\n\nThe real issue: Neither bill would pass the other chamber. Furthermore, the House will leave town on Friday, just as the cuts take effect.\n\nThe conundrum: Republicans are uncertain about how to approach the sequester. They are caught in a mix of messaging, with some praising Obama for finally reducing spending by at least 2 percent, while others view the cuts as damaging, particularly to the Pentagon.\n\nBoehner and his team believe they are in a strong position, as Obama is advocating for tax increases to mitigate damaging cuts to the Pentagon, while Boehner is championing spending cuts. Additionally, this week, Boehner expressed support for the most significant bipartisan undertaking: tax reform. He even designated the leadership's most prized bill title \u2014 H.R. 1 \u2014 to rewriting the Tax Code.\n\n\"Dave Camp, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is continuing a thoughtful and thorough review of the Tax Code with an eye on tax reform,\" Boehner said at the CUNA convention, according to prepared remarks. \"It's time we shift the balance of power from the tax collector to the taxpayer.\"",
    " Title: Former North Charleston Officer Michael Slager Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Murder of Walter Scott\n\nIn a Charleston courtroom on Thursday, former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 2015 shooting of unarmed black motorist Walter Scott. The ruling, handed down by U.S. District Judge David Norton, classified the killing as second-degree murder.\n\nSlager, 36, was a patrolman in North Charleston when he pulled over Scott, a father of four, for a broken brake light on April 4, 2015. Slager pleaded guilty in May to violating Scott's civil rights by using excessive force, a charge that carried a possible lifetime prison sentence. Slager shot at Scott eight times, hitting him five times.\n\nThe state murder trial for Slager's actions ended in a deadlocked jury in 2016. This federal sentence marks one of the few instances in recent years of a U.S. police officer receiving prison time for an on-duty shooting.\n\n\"Everyone recognizes that this was a tragedy,\" Judge Norton told the courtroom, which was filled with members of both men's families. \"What's just for the Scott family is not necessarily just for the Slager family, and what's just for the Slager family is not necessarily just for the Scott family. It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA bystander's cellphone video of the shooting drew national attention to the case, renewing concerns about police treatment of minorities. The footage was a central piece of evidence during the four-day sentencing hearing, with both prosecutors and defense lawyers arguing it supported their respective cases.\n\nJudge Norton sided with the government, finding that Slager had committed second-degree murder and obstructed justice by lying to investigators about Scott trying to grab his Taser. The judge rejected the defense argument that Slager was provoked or acted in the heat of passion.\n\nScott's relatives and their lawyers hailed the sentence as a historic moment for justice. They called on law enforcement to reconsider the use of deadly force. Before court adjourned, several family members expressed forgiveness towards Slager, but their pain remains.\n\n\"We will never be the same again,\" said Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's older brother. \"How could someone shoot someone in the back like that as they were running away?\"",
    " Title: Romney's Response to Diplomatic Crisis Sparks Controversy, Draws Comparisons to Carter Era\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a presidential election campaign dominated by domestic issues, the recent attacks on American diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya have introduced a foreign policy crisis into the mix. The embassy attacks, including another overnight in Yemen, have provided images such as an American ambassador's body being dragged in the street, which could fuel comparisons.\n\nMitt Romney's overtly political response to these events has drawn criticism from both the left and right, but some Republicans argue that the flare-up offers Romney an opportunity to further portray President Obama as the heir to President Carter.\n\n\"The 2012 election is similar to 1980, when you had a foreign crisis in the Mideast and a bad economy at home,\" said American Crossroads chairman and former Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan.\n\nForeign policy had been considered a strong point for Mr. Obama heading into the election. He had wound down the war in Iraq, overseen American efforts to help oust Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, and had approved the daring attack that killed terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. However, the diplomatic post attacks have provided a new context that could potentially challenge this perception.\n\nEvangelical organizer David Lane, founder of the California-based Pastors and Pews, said, \"America's 39th president was the last president who created such instability with the U.S. economy and foreign policy: the byproduct was turmoil in the world. Barack Obama, meet Jimmy Carter.\"\n\nDemocrats have rejected the comparison, and Mr. Obama was critical of Romney's handling of the situation, stating, \"As president you can't'shoot first and aim later.'\"\n\nSome Republicans distanced themselves from Romney's remarks, which accused the administration of blaming Americans' exercise of free speech rather than the attackers. This criticism was based on a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt.\n\nHowever, other analysts defended Romney's handling of the situation. Danielle Pletka, American Enterprise Institute vice president for foreign- and defense-policy studies, stated, \"Romney's condemnation of the apology wasn't embarrassing or too early; it was correct, it was timely, and the only beef commentators have with it is that the White House didn't issue it first.\"\n\nShe noted that Mr. Obama's statement, \"While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants,\" was equivocal, while Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement was a clear condemnation.",
    " Title: A Year of Surprising Success: John Kerry's Tenure as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a year marked by skepticism and challenging international circumstances, John Kerry has emerged as a surprising success in his role as Secretary of State, according to David Rothkopf, a prominent author and former Clinton administration official. Kerry, who was once considered a familiar face with a moment that had passed, has made significant strides in restoring diplomacy as a central pillar of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nRothkopf, in his analysis, highlights Kerry's efforts in three key areas: the Israel-Palestine peace process, the Syrian chemical deal, and the Iran nuclear negotiations. Kerry's tenacity, creativity, and courage have earned him widespread praise, with some describing him as a \"national treasure\" and the Israel-Palestine peace process as the \"most remarkable effort\" they have seen in their lifetime.\n\nHowever, the challenges ahead are significant. The success of these deals will determine Kerry's legacy and the Obama administration's foreign policy. The Iran deal, for instance, will need to be acceptable to Congress and U.S. allies, while ensuring that it does not strengthen Iran without providing real peace of mind for the U.S. and its regional allies. The Syria chemical deal, aimed at eliminating weapons, is currently not progressing as quickly as hoped, and the situation in Syria continues to serve as a breeding ground for extremists.\n\nThe Israel-Palestine peace process, too, faces challenges, with sniping from top Israeli officials and divisions among the Palestinians. The decay in Iraq and the potential for similar issues in Afghanistan post-U.S. withdrawal, as well as the spread of extremist groups like al Qaeda, are other significant concerns.\n\nRothkopf concludes that while Kerry has had a remarkable year, his toughest work lies ahead. The success or failure of the opportunities he has helped create will determine not just Kerry's legacy, but also that of the President he serves. The next two years will be crucial in shaping the U.S.'s role in the world and its relationships with key allies and adversaries.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Response to Coronavirus Raises Questions on Preparedness and Coordination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak has raised concerns about its preparedness and coordination, as the disease continues to spread globally. The administration's handling of the situation has been criticized for appearing disjointed and lacking a clear strategy, which could potentially impact public confidence in President Trump as the outbreak evolves.\n\nWhy it matters:\nWhile the coronavirus is currently under control within the U.S., the potential for the disease to worsen in the coming months poses a significant challenge for the administration. If the administration appears to be caught off guard, it could lead to a loss of public trust in President Trump.\n\nCase in point: Last night's coronavirus press conference was marked by inconsistencies and confusion. President Trump expressed surprise at the deadliness of the annual flu virus, while accurately emphasizing public health officials' advice to treat the coronavirus like the flu. However, he downplayed the likelihood of a widespread U.S. outbreak, despite public health officials, including the CDC, stating that such an outbreak is likely.\n\nA new U.S. case, which may have been transmitted locally, was confirmed during the press conference, highlighting the potential for a domestic outbreak. \"This is such a shitshow. Thank goodness the markets are closed,\" a former Health and Human Services official who is close to the White House reportedly said during the briefing.\n\nWhat we're hearing: Sources familiar with the decision tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the call to put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the administration's coronavirus response was made yesterday. The decision had been a subject of discussion among staff, but it was unclear how many, if any, officials knew beforehand that Trump was going to announce it at the press conference. Several people were reportedly shocked, especially given that Pence is heavily involved in Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nNot many people knew what Trump was going to say at the press conference when he announced it in a tweet Wednesday morning. President Trump's statements were reportedly upbeat, which some attribute to his concern for the stock market.\n\nTrump has also warned Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, along with other officials, to avoid criticizing China's response to the virus. \"They have enough problems without you going out and saying they're not doing enough,\" Trump reportedly told Azar, according to a source familiar with their conversation.\n\nOur thought bubble: President Trump appears to want the panic over the virus to end as soon as possible to restore normalcy to the markets.",
    " Title: NSA Surveillance Programs Under Scrutiny: Clapper Defends Internet Data Mining and Phone Records Collection\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of leaked documents revealing two secret National Security Agency (NSA) intelligence-gathering programs, the Obama administration is facing criticism and calls for explanation. The Guardian newspaper report, which detailed the collection of phone records from millions, was followed by a Washington Post report that disclosed another program that scours major Internet companies for data.\n\nA former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the program, which began in 2007 by the FBI and NSA, allows the agencies to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video, and other data. The program, known as PRISM, has not been disclosed publicly before.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday, decrying the leak of the materials and expressing concern that the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities. Clapper also took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism.\n\nClapper stated that the government was \"prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.\" He also emphasized that all information acquired is subject to strict, court-imposed restrictions on review and handling. The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nA senior administration official also pushed back, stating that the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that \"does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.\" It was not immediately clear how the official defined \"targeting.\"\n\nThe program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress, the official said. The program involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.\n\nAccording to slides from an internal presentation intended for NSA senior analysts and obtained by the Washington Post, the program accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports. The companies that participate knowingly in the program are Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple, the Washington Post reports.\n\nA number of the Internet companies issued statements Thursday night saying they only complied when legally bound to do so. The Washington Post report states that companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.\n\nThe classified program is code-named PRISM, the Washington Post reported, and has not been disclosed publicly before. Members of Congress who are aware of the program were reportedly bound by oath to keep it confidential. According to slides from an internal presentation, there has been \u201ccontinued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post report also details how an analyst can obtain full access to Facebook\u2019s extensive search and surveillance capabilities against the variety of online social networking services, and how Skype can be monitored for audio, video, chat, and file transfers. Google services that can be monitored include Gmail, voice and video chat, Google Drive files, and search terms.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have issued statements emphasizing their commitment to protecting user data and complying with the law. Microsoft also stated that the company only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena.",
    " Title: U.S. Voting Practices at the U.N. General Assembly Discrepant with U.S. Interests, According to State Department Report\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump prepares to address the U.N. General Assembly this week, a new State Department report reveals that the world body is out of sync with U.S. interests in more than two-thirds of votes, potentially raising further concerns within the Trump administration about the organization and America's financial commitment to it.\n\nThe report, which covers voting practices at the U.N. in 2018, shows that the U.S. and the U.N. General Assembly as a whole were in alignment just 31 percent of the time, a decrease from the final year of the Obama administration when they were in agreement 41 percent of the time. This means that the U.S. voted against 70 percent of assembly resolutions requiring a vote, more than any other U.N. member state.\n\nThe congressionally mandated report for 2018 also reviewed voting by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council and 193 members of the General Assembly and compared countries' voting records with the U.S. An additional section looked at how the world body votes on Israel.\n\nFormer Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, in 2017, stated that the U.S. would be \"taking names\" of countries that vote against U.S. interests, particularly in regard to Israel, while Trump warned that the administration was watching votes, specifically from those that take U.S. money.\n\nThe 10 countries that are most out of sync with the U.S. (along with U.S. aid they received in fiscal 2018, according to the USAID website) are: Burundi ($69 million), Syria ($819 million), North Korea ($2.6 million), Turkmenistan ($4.5 million), Venezuela ($25 million), Nicaragua ($30 million), Niger ($573 million), Cuba ($12 million), and Iran (less than $1 million).\n\nAfghanistan, which according to the USAID portal received about $760 million, only voted with the U.S. 19 percent of the time. Pakistan, which gets $370 million, voted only 15 percent of the time with the U.S. Jordan, which gets $1.2 billion, was 21 percent in alignment with the U.S.\n\nHowever, the U.S. still enjoys support from some allies. The 10 friendliest records in descending order are: Israel, Micronesia, Canada, Australia, Marshall Islands, Great Britain, Hungary, France, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2018, Haley noted that the U.S. pays for more than a fifth of the U.N. budget, more than the next three highest donor nations combined. She stated at the issuing of the last report on 2017 voting records that \"this is not an acceptable return on our investment.\"\n\nAn analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations found that the U.S. government contributed more than $10 billion to the United Nations in 2017 - about $7 billion was voluntary and $3.5 billion was assessed.\n\nSince then, the U.S. has pulled out of a number of U.N. institutions, including the controversial Human Rights Council and the U.N. Social, Cultural and Economic body (UNESCO). It also yanked funding from the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency.\n\nThe report also found that the U.N. General Assembly is largely continuing in its anti-Israel slant, adopting 21 anti-Israel resolutions in 2018, the same amount as 2017. The U.S. supported these resolutions just 14 percent of the time.\n\nIt was perhaps with this in mind that new U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft gave a fiery speech at the U.N. Security Council last week, slamming anti-Israel bias at the body and reasserting U.S. commitment to its ally.\n\n\"It is inexcusable that pervasive, anti-Israel bias still exists in the United Nations, and that we continue to witness attempts by some UN Member States to undermine Israel\u2019s standing as a full member of the community of nations,\" she said. \"The United States vigorously opposes all such efforts.\"\n\nIsrael's Ambassador Danny Danon told Fox News that while anti-Israel bias remains, the \"needle is moving\" in the right direction and pointed to instances such as the U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Hamas last year. The resolution garnered a simple majority of support in the chamber but did not gain the two-thirds majority needed to pass.\n\n\"The resolution against Hamas, for example, is a notable success because, for the first time, a majority of member states supported condemning the group and labeling it a terrorist organization,\" he told Fox News. \"And there are many more successes that are taking place outside of GA and UNSC resolutions, but will begin to influence them in the years to come.\"\n\nTrump will address the General Assembly on Tuesday, when the issues of both Israel and value for money at the U.N. are likely to be addressed in his speech.",
    " Title: Leaks in Manchester Terror Attack Investigation: A Breach of Trust and Resumption of Intelligence Sharing\n\nIn the aftermath of the Manchester terror attack, the National Police Chiefs' Council in Britain has condemned the unauthorized disclosure of potential evidence as a breach of trust. The Council stated that such leaks undermine investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses, and their families.\n\nManchester's top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, echoed the criticism, expressing concern over the distress caused to families already suffering from their loss. Earlier in the day, there were reports that the Manchester police had ceased sharing details of the investigation with American counterparts. However, after assurances from President Trump, the police announced that intelligence sharing had resumed, if it had ever stopped in the first place.\n\nMark Rowley, an assistant commissioner in charge of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard and a member of the Police Chiefs' Council, issued a statement emphasizing that they are now working closely with their key partners around the world, including those in the 'Five Eyes' intelligence alliance (the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada).\n\nThe media, including The Times, has been criticized for the disclosure of images and information related to the attack. However, the media maintains that their coverage has been both comprehensive and responsible, providing information about terrorism from various angles, including the impact on communities and nations.\n\nPresident Trump's stance on leaks has been inconsistent, with him capitalizing on leaks during his presidential campaign but expressing frustration over information leaks from his own White House. Details of his conversations with foreign leaders and his associates' ties with Russia have been leaked, leading to investigations and personnel changes.\n\nRecent leaks about President Trump's private conversations with James B. Comey, the FBI director he fired, have fueled investigations into his associates' ties with Russia. The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to take over the Russia investigation following reports of Trump's request for Comey to shut down an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.",
    " Title: Missouri Governor Set to Sign Bill Restricting Abortions, Part of National Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nMissouri's Republican Governor, Mike Parson, is expected to sign a bill this week that would ban most abortions in the Midwestern state after the eighth week of pregnancy. The bill, which was approved by the Republican-controlled state legislature last week, would enact one of the United States' most restrictive abortion bans.\n\nGovernor Parson announced his intention to sign the bill to reporters on Friday, but has not yet set a date for the signing. According to local media reports, he has until July 14 to sign the bill into law.\n\nThe state is one of eight where Republican-controlled legislatures this year have passed new restrictions on abortion. The coordinated campaign aims to prompt the conservative-majority Supreme Court to reconsider or overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nThe most restrictive of these bills was signed into law in Alabama last week, banning abortion at all times and in almost all cases, including when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, but allowing exceptions when the mother's life is in danger. The Missouri bill also offers no exception for cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has announced it will sue to block Alabama's law from taking effect. Last week, the ACLU joined Planned Parenthood, the women's reproductive healthcare provider, in suing Ohio over its recent six-week abortion ban. Mississippi will defend a new law banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat has been detected in a federal appeals court on Tuesday after the Center for Reproductive Rights sued to block it taking effect.\n\nAbortion is one of the most contentious social issues in the United States. Opponents often cite religious belief in saying that fetuses deserve rights similar to those of infants. Abortion rights advocates argue that the bans deprive women of equal rights and endanger those who resort to riskier, illegal methods to end a pregnancy.\n\nKentucky, Georgia, Utah, Mississippi, and Arkansas have also passed new restrictions on abortion this year. Conservative lawmakers have been emboldened in their efforts to roll back Roe v. Wade by two judicial appointments by President Donald Trump that have given conservatives a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday took no action on appeals seeking to revive two abortion restrictions enacted in Indiana in 2016.",
    " Title: NATO Members Increase Defense Spending in Response to President Trump's Call for Greater Contributions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox Business Network's \"Mornings with Maria,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that European allies and Canada are indeed increasing their defense spending in response to President Trump's insistence on fair burden-sharing within the NATO alliance.\n\nDuring the interview, Stoltenberg stated that the target for defense spending is to be at 2% of GDP by 2024, a goal that was agreed upon in 2014. He also noted that more allies are already meeting the 2% target, and the majority have plans in place to reach this goal by 2024.\n\nPresident Trump has long expressed his frustration with what he perceives as a disproportionate financial contribution from NATO members. In a speech at the NATO summit in July 2018, he stated that prior to his first meeting, the amount of money being spent by countries was decreasing significantly. However, he noted that since then, commitments have been made, and the amount of money being spent is increasing substantially.\n\nAccording to a December 2019 article from Business Insider, the 2014 agreement stipulated that each member state would increase their own defense spending to 2% of their respective GDP by 2024. Since 2014, several countries in the alliance have significantly increased their contributions to meet the 2% threshold.\n\nAmong the countries to have reached or exceeded the goal since 2014 are Estonia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Bulgaria. Bulgaria, for instance, increased its defense spending from less than 1.5% of GDP in 2014 to 3.25% in 2019. Other nations such as Turkey, France, and Norway are also closing in on the 2% target.\n\nThe United States still provides the most, with 3.42% of its GDP spent on defense, according to a NATO report. The report notes that the 2019 numbers are estimates.\n\nSpeaking before a joint session of Congress in April 2019, Stoltenberg emphasized the need for NATO allies to spend more on defense. He stated that the increased defense spending would allow for investments in new capabilities, including advanced fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, missile defense, and surveillance drones.\n\nStoltenberg concluded by stating that this increase in defense spending is beneficial for both Europe and America, making NATO stronger and more capable of addressing global security challenges.",
    " Title: Virginia Delegate Proposes Bill Mandating Licensing for AR-15 Ownership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at gun control, Virginia Delegate Mark Levine (D) has introduced a bill that would require all AR-15 owners in the state to acquire a license for the ownership of these firearms. The bill, HB 961, also applies to guns categorized as \"assault firearms\" by Democrats.\n\nLevine defines an \"assault firearm\" as a semi-automatic center-fire rifle that can expel single or multiple projectiles with a magazine capacity exceeding 10 rounds. He further specifies certain cosmetic traits that classify a gun as an \"assault firearm,\" including a folding or telescoping stock, a pistol grip, a thumbhole stock, a second handgrip, a bayonet mount, a grenade launcher, a flare launcher, a silencer, a flash suppressor, a muzzle brake, a muzzle compensator, a threaded barrel capable of accepting certain attachments, or any characteristic of a similar kind.\n\nIf Delegate Levine's bill is passed by the state legislature and signed into law, current AR-15 owners, as well as owners of other \"assault firearms,\" will be given a grace period to acquire the necessary license from the state. According to the bill's summary, any person who legally owns an assault firearm on July 1, 2020, may retain possession of such firearm after January 1, 2021, if they have obtained a permit from the Department of State Police to possess an assault firearm in accordance with the bill's procedures.",
    " Title: The Great Gun Control Fizzle: Obama's Pledge for New Gun Control Laws Faces Setbacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, President Barack Obama pledged to use his office to pass new gun control laws, sparking widespread support and anticipation among many. However, recent polls suggest that the momentum for stricter gun laws is waning, with support dropping significantly in just a few months.\n\nThe president has been actively advocating for gun control, holding rallies, using children as props, and meeting with parents of the Newtown victims. He has called on Congress to take action, urging them to \"join me in finishing the job \u2013 for our communities and, most importantly, for our kids.\"\n\nDespite the president's efforts, support for stricter gun laws has decreased. According to CBS News, support dropped from 57% to 47%, while CNN reported a drop from 52% to 43%. An ABC News/Washington Post poll showed a slight decrease, from 54% to 52%, but this is still lower than the support for gay marriage.\n\nThe main focus of the debate now is expanding background checks, although any bill that can pass both the Senate and the House will likely be less extensive than what the president or his supporters would prefer. The assault weapons ban and any limit on magazine size have been abandoned by Democrats in the Senate.\n\nThe gun control debate has once again highlighted the president's inexperience in legislative mechanics and his inability to shape public opinion effectively. Before making grandiose promises that his party's majority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, couldn't fulfill, the president might have consulted with Reid about what was plausible and adjusted his approach accordingly. He might have also taken into account Reid's ribbon-cutting ceremony with National Rifle Association honcho Wayne LaPierre at the Clark County Shooting Park in Las Vegas in 2010.\n\nIt is worth noting that 90% of Americans support universal background checks. However, the current political climate and the power dynamics within Congress seem to be working against the president's gun control agenda.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina Steals the Show in GOP Debate, Rand Paul and Chris Christie Also Shine\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second Republican presidential debate, featuring 11 candidates, including Carly Fiorina who was moved from the \"kids table\" debate due to a change in CNN's eligibility criteria, was a lively and engaging event that lasted for three hours. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, from immigration to vaccinations.\n\nCarly Fiorina made a strong impression from the outset, dominating the first third of the debate and demonstrating her qualifications to lead foreign policy. Fiorina's ability to seamlessly blend foreign policy and pro-life issues in one coherent response was particularly noteworthy. In response to a question about her participation in the main debate, Fiorina tactfully addressed the \"look at that face\" comment made by Donald Trump last week, stating, \"Women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\"\n\nOne of the most viral moments of the night came when Sen. Rand Paul called out Gov. Jeb Bush for his past marijuana use and his reluctance to embrace medical or recreational marijuana legalization. Bush admitted to smoking weed, and an argument over marijuana legalization ensued.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio also had a strong performance, sounding coherent and logical on immigration and immigration reform. Rubio emphasized the need for sensible immigration reform to fix the legal immigration system that \"no longer works,\" and stressed the need for a merit-based system.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was in top form last night, delivering a more focused and lively performance than in the first debate. Christie defended President Bush's invasion of Afghanistan, citing his family's personal experience on September 11, 2001, and his work as a prosecutor.\n\nPerhaps the most perplexing moment of the night came when Dr. Ben Carson and Donald Trump were asked to address the misconception that vaccines cause autism. When Carson, a neurosurgeon, was asked to tell Trump to stop making such claims, he seemed to waffle and refused to outright condemn Trump's comments.\n\nOverall, the debate was a lively and engaging event that showcased the candidates' strengths and weaknesses. While some candidates, such as Bush and Gov. Scott Walker, may not have had any particularly memorable lines, a tag-team exchange defending George W. Bush's policies between Bush and Walker was a highlight of the night.",
    " Title: Emmy Awards Ratings Plummet to Record Low Amid Political Attacks and Controversial Content\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 69th annual Emmy Awards have reported a significant drop in ratings, marking the lowest-rated Emmy telecast ever, should six unreported markets from Florida not significantly alter the numbers due to Hurricane Irma's impact. The event, hosted by Stephen Colbert, was heavily criticized for its political attacks on President Trump, with the overnight rating among metered market households down 2.4 percent from the 2016 edition.\n\nMedia Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor described the Emmys as a \"Hollywood bubble show,\" stating, \"Actors and directors get to pretend they are important because they are doing such insightful takes on life in America, when they have zero idea what life in America is for the other 330 million people.\"\n\nDespite the ratings decline, Gainor believes the Emmys will continue to incorporate politics into their programming. \"Hollywood won't walk away from politics. The left wants to force politics into every single aspect of our lives -- from sports to movies to the food we eat. They won't be satisfied until we are all appropriately woke to their struggles du jour,\" he told Fox News.\n\nThroughout the three-hour program, Trump was a recurring target, with Alec Baldwin winning an award for his portrayal of Trump on \"Saturday Night Live\" and using his speech to mock the president. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer even made an appearance, poking fun at his tenure, but the appearance sparked controversy among some viewers.\n\nAcademy Awards prognosticator Steve Pond labeled the event as \"the most political Emmys show ever,\" and noted that voters opted for politically charged shows such as \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Atlanta\" over less-polarizing programs like \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nGainor agreed, stating, \"The Emmys celebrate shows that almost no one either watches or cares about.\" He added, \"No ordinary Americans care about 'The Handmaid's Tale.' No ordinary Americans watch 'Veep.' The only show the Emmys were honoring that most people even recognize was 'Saturday Night Live.'\"\n\nThe Emmys went head-to-head against NBC's \"Sunday Night Football,\" which may have contributed to the viewership decline, but the awards have now hit new ratings lows for three consecutive years. Some viewers may be seeking an escape from politics, while others may not agree with the Hollywood elite's political views. Colbert and the event's producers seemed to disregard the fact that roughly half the country wouldn't find non-stop attacks on Trump amusing.\n\n\"Entertainment Tonight\" anchor Kevin Frazier, appearing on \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday, declared, \"Politics took center stage,\" with the \"recurring punchline\" being Donald Trump. The CBS morning show co-hosts seemed to approve, but the dismal rating's release may have changed their perspective.\n\nGainor questioned, \"Why would anyone who isn't a die-hard liberal watch?\" The Emmys' future remains uncertain, as the event struggles to maintain viewership and balance political content with entertainment.",
    " Title: Senate's Filibuster Rule and Public Opinion: A Disconnect in the Passage of Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings, a significant majority of Americans have expressed support for expanded background checks on gun sales. However, a bill aimed at achieving this goal was recently defeated in the Senate, leaving many questioning the disconnect between public opinion and legislative action.\n\nThe primary reason for this disconnect lies in the Senate's procedural rules, which enable a minority to block a bill with the support of 60 senators, rather than the simple majority that would be required in other legislative bodies. The legislation on background checks had the support of 54 senators, but it fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.\n\nBeyond Senate procedures, there are several factors that contribute to the chasm between public opinion and legislative action. First, members of Congress represent specific geographical constituencies, many of which may diverge from national opinion. This is particularly true for gun control proposals, which enjoy widespread support in national polls but face strong resistance in regions such as the South and Mountain West.\n\nSecond, issue polls often include nonvoters, while elected officials focus on the people who actually show up to vote. Additionally, politicians must cater to the sentiments of their primary voters, as they need to nurture their ideological bases to avoid defeat in primary elections.\n\nThird, intensity plays a significant role, as a passionate minority can outweigh a relatively indifferent majority. Gun control has historically exhibited this pattern, with Second Amendment enthusiasts being more likely to engage with their lawmakers and vote on the basis of this one issue, while supporters of more gun regulation may express support in surveys but fail to follow through with action.\n\nFourth, presidents have limited ability to drive public opinion and mass political action. Even at the peak of their popularity, presidents can only motivate those who already support their positions. In a more demanding media environment, presidents have to compete with hundreds of other channels and the internet, and their critics and opponents have more opportunities to respond in real time.\n\nFifth, the bicameral legislature and the separation of powers, designed by the Framers, prevent an automatic translation of public opinion into public policy. Supporters of the system argue that it fosters deliberation and ensures the protection of minority rights, while critics claim that it prevents the passage of necessary legislation.\n\nIn conclusion, the defeat of the background checks bill in the Senate highlights the disconnect between public opinion and legislative action. To bridge this gap, political progressives must learn from the National Rifle Association's successes, matching their zeal, persistence, and organization. The president's political group, Organizing for America (OFA), may have the resources and savvy to succeed, with the help of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The OFA claims that it is not a purely partisan organization and will pressure Democrats and Republicans alike. We'll see if it follows through.",
    " Title: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg Endorses Joe Biden, Exits Democratic Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, media mogul and billionaire Michael Bloomberg announced his withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race on Wednesday, following a disappointing Super Tuesday performance. The former New York City mayor, who entered the race late and skipped the first four nominating contests, will now endorse Joe Biden, the former Vice President.\n\nIn a message to supporters, Bloomberg stated, \"While I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life. I\u2019ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday\u2019s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.\"\n\nBloomberg's campaign, which was heavily funded by his personal fortune, saw limited success. He won only in the U.S. territory American Samoa and took home just four nominating delegates, equating to approximately $5 million per delegate. Biden's momentum, on the other hand, surged on Tuesday, propelling him to the front of the pack as the more traditional liberal alternative to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nBloomberg acknowledged that his presence on the ballot may have blunted Biden's surge. \"Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump\u2014because it is clear that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to other candidates who recently dropped out and endorsed Biden, Bloomberg believes the former Vice President has the best chance at beating President Trump. \"I\u2019ve known Joe for a very long time. I know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country\u2014including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve had the chance to work with Joe on those issues over the years, and Joe has fought for working people his whole life.\"\n\nWith Bloomberg's exit, only two major candidates remain in the race as also-rans behind Biden and Sanders: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have already endorsed Biden following their own exits from the race.\n\nPresident Trump, in a series of tweets, responded to Bloomberg's announcement, stating, \"I could have told him long ago that he didn\u2019t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe\u2019s campaign, hoping to save face. It won\u2019t work!\" Trump also predicted that \"Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O\u2019Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS.\" Trump concluded, \"This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Reinforces School Enrollment Rights for Undocumented Immigrant Students\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement released Thursday, Attorney General Eric Holder and Education Secretary Arne Duncan emphasized the obligation of public schools to enroll students regardless of their immigration status, citing concerns over discrimination against children of undocumented parents. The new guidance, issued by the Justice Department, aims to ensure schools comply with this obligation and avoid discrimination based on race, color, or national origin.\n\nThe updated guidance, an amendment to earlier guidelines issued in 2011, encourages schools to be more flexible in accepting documents from illegal parents and to not require documents that may prove a child's age and residence, such as state-issued driver's licenses or Social Security cards. Instead, parents can produce alternative documents like utility bills or leases.\n\nThe new guidelines are based on the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, which established that children of illegal immigrants have a right to a public education. The court's ruling struck down a Texas statute that denied funding for education to the children of illegal immigrants and a school district's attempt to charge undocumented persons an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each illegal immigrant student.\n\nDespite the long-standing Supreme Court decision, some states and school boards have challenged the ruling, with California being one of the most notable examples. In 1994, voters approved a referendum to deny all state-funded benefits, including education, to illegals. The courts later struck down the referendum.\n\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to pass immigration legislation that would have allowed states to deny public education benefits to certain illegal aliens or to charge them tuition. However, the legislation was withdrawn after President Bill Clinton threatened to veto it. As a result, school boards began to take action against illegal immigrants by requiring Social Security numbers or driver's licenses and employing practices such as proposing separate schools for immigrant students and requiring paperwork designed to identify immigration status.\n\nToday, schools in states like New York, New Jersey, and Arizona, among others, routinely inquire into immigration status as part of the enrollment process, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In Alabama, public schools must determine the immigration status of children and parents during enrollment and can report the undocumented persons to immigration authorities.\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to enrollment policies since it first issued guidance in 2011, according to Mr. Duncan. Complaints were from Ohio, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., among others. In addition to these complaints, there have been a number of undisclosed complaints filed in the Justice Department. In Georgia, the Justice Department evaluated the enrollment policies of over 200 school districts and helped them resolve issues, authorities said.\n\n\"We have continued to hear troubling reports of actions being taken by school districts around the country that have a chilling effect on student enrollment, raising barriers for undocumented children and children from immigrant families who seek to receive the public education to which they are entitled,\" Mr. Holder said.\n\n\"Today's updated guidance reaffirms the longstanding principle, established by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, that all children living in our country have a right to equal access to public education,\" ACLU Legislative Counsel Joanne Lin said in an email. \"School districts must adhere to this guidance, and meet their constitutional obligations to ensure that no child is locked outside the schoolhouse door.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and International Community Pressure Syria Over Alleged Chemical Weapons Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing story, the Syrian conflict has taken a new turn as rebel forces claim that the regime of President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons in an attack near Damascus, potentially resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. The allegations, if confirmed, could mark the deadliest chemical weapons deployment yet in the ongoing Syrian conflict.\n\nThe Syrian government has denied the use of chemical weapons, but the White House is attempting to verify the reports independently. The incident has put President Assad in a precarious position, as he has previously expressed a desire to disprove allegations of chemical weapons attacks. The Syrian regime now faces a decision on whether to allow a 20-member team of United Nations chemical weapons inspectors, who are currently in the country, to examine the new sites.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest stated, \"It's time for them to live up to that claim. And if they actually are interested in getting to the bottom of the use of chemical weapons and whether or not that\u2019s occurred in Syria, then they will allow the U.N. investigative team that\u2019s already in Syria to access the site where chemical weapons may have been used.\"\n\nThe death toll from the attack, as reported by rebels, varies widely, ranging from the low hundreds to over 1,300. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency session to call for a \"thorough, impartial and prompt investigation\" of the charges against Syria. The U.N. ambassador of Argentina, the current council president, expressed \"strong concern\" about the latest chemical weapons use allegations and called for \"clarity on what happened.\"\n\nThe incident comes almost a year after President Obama issued a \"red line\" to the Syrian regime, stating that the U.S. would ensure \"enormous consequences\" if chemical weapons were used or prepared for deployment. The White House has been cautious in its response, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest declining to specify potential consequences when asked by reporters.\n\nThe U.S. remains limited in the steps it can take due to uncertainty about aiding the interests of the rebels. General Martin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote a letter this week to a congressman stating that the Pentagon is opposed to even limited action in Syria backing the rebels, as it is not certain that such action would aid those who support American interests.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have called for intervention to stop the ongoing civil war, which has been raging since 2011 and has resulted in over 100,000 deaths, according to U.N. estimates. Some lawmakers argue that the U.S. must act soon to salvage its credibility in the region and tip the balance of power against President Assad.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has suggested that the attack may have been a \"provocation\" by the rebels, according to a report by RT, a network that broadcasts Russian views. The U.S. has previously concluded that chemical weapons have been used in a few attacks, with the culprits believed to be Syrian government forces. However, the administration has been tentative in making more definitive claims due to past questions about U.S. accusations of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in Iraq.\n\nThe investigation into the incident now falls to the U.N. team of chemical weapons inspectors, who will need to renegotiate access to the sites if they are to gain access to the locations of this week's attack.",
    " Title: Unheralded Hospital Workers Face Uncertainty and Risk Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nIn the heart of the ongoing battle against the novel coronavirus, hospital maintenance workers and housekeepers, often unnoticed, are playing a vital role in keeping hospitals running. These individuals, who mop floors, dispose of trash, fix plumbing, and change fan filters, lack the medical training to protect themselves adequately, and they claim that guidance from employers has been inconsistent.\n\nKatina McDavis, a 43-year-old housekeeper at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, spends 40 hours a week cleaning hospital rooms. She has been on the job for more than 20 years. McDavis, who is a diabetic, has been coming to work every day despite the ongoing pandemic. She tries to wear a surgical mask when cleaning if necessary but often finds that they are not available or is told she does not need one. Two of her colleagues have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAnne Igoe, vice president of a Chicago-based branch of the Service Employees International Union, which represents hospital workers like McDavis, stated that hospitals often fail to communicate safety protocols effectively. For instance, rooms with COVID-19 patients have at times been mistakenly labeled otherwise, leading housekeepers to enter with insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital stated in a statement that it has enough PPE to keep workers safe and provides multiple channels for communication. However, a non-scientific poll by the Service Employees International Union showed that 75% of some 250 respondents, mostly housekeepers and nurse's assistants in Chicago and Indiana, have been told either they do not need PPE or must ask a nurse for it.\n\nFearful of contracting COVID-19, some hospital janitors are refusing to take on certain tasks. At Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, a janitor asked a patient to clean her own room, according to her sister. Nurses at New York-Presbyterian Hospital are at times taking out trash themselves to preserve PPE, one nurse at the hospital said.\n\nTo cope with the increased patient loads and demands, a number of hospitals are seeking to hire more housekeepers. Retaining those they hire is another matter. Angel Medrano, a recruiter of hospital housekeeping staff in the San Francisco Bay Area, stated that a hospital he works with tripled the number of housekeeping staff it required in March. Most of the people his firm has hired are African Americans or Hispanics who have lost their jobs cleaning hotels and offices.\n\nStill, around 20 people quit within the first couple of days on the job, mostly over concerns about PPE. Kimberly Hughes, a housekeeper at a Montana hospital, stated that she has the chronic inflammatory lung disease COPD, leaving her at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. Fearful of contracting the virus, some hospital janitors are refusing to take on certain tasks.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Understanding Trump's Popularity: A Look at the Rationality Behind an Irrational Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of former President Barack Obama's Rutgers University commencement speech, a question has been raised: Why do Donald Trump's voters continue to support him despite his seemingly illogical statements and disregard for facts?\n\nObama, in his speech, criticized anti-intellectualism in today's political debate, stating that \"ignorance or not knowing what you are talking about is not challenging political correctness, it's just dumb.\" He further emphasized that when leaders express a disdain for facts and are not held accountable for repeating falsehoods, it poses a significant problem for the nation.\n\nHowever, it appears that Trump's supporters are not choosing to reject logic as Obama suggests. Instead, they may be looking for action or an emotional connection above all. According to a report by The Christian Science Monitor's Patrik Jonsson, Trump's followers feel that he has touched something deep within them, transcending political reasoning. They see him as a leader who can make America great again.\n\nOne Trump voter in Georgia told Jonsson, \"We need a leader, not an ideologue.\" In this context, the coherence of Trump's debunked statements, such as his claim about seeing Muslims celebrating 9/11 on New Jersey rooftops, may seem less important to his supporters.\n\nPolitical scientists Eric Oliver of the University of Chicago and Wendy Rahn of the University of Minnesota have found that Trump voters are more likely to distrust traditional sources of authority. This disbelief in mainstream experts is one of the strongest predictors of a Trump voter, according to the pair. They are farther over on the \"mistrust experts\" scale than all other Republicans, and they are in a different universe on this question than Clinton supporters.\n\nIn the end, Trump voters may see themselves as the rational ones in the national political discussion, as opposed to Obama Democrats. This disconnect in perception of rationality between the two sides highlights the complexity and nuance of political beliefs and the factors that drive voters' decisions.",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Billionaire Businessman and Independent Presidential Candidate, Dies at 89\n\nRenowned businessman, philanthropist, and independent presidential candidate H. Ross Perot has passed away at the age of 89, according to a statement from James Fuller, a representative for the Perot family. Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, lost his battle with leukemia after a five-month struggle.\n\nIn a statement, Fuller described Perot as a man of integrity, action, and deep compassion. \"In business and in life, Ross was a man of integrity and action. A true American patriot and a man of rare vision, principle, and deep compassion, he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors,\" Fuller said.\n\nPerot is survived by his wife, Margot, his five children, and 16 grandchildren. This 1992 file photo shows presidential hopeful H. Ross Perot at a rally in Austin, Texas.\n\nPerot began his career in sales at IBM before founding his first company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), in 1962 with just $1,000 in savings. More than two decades later, he launched information technology services provider Perot Systems, which was acquired in 2009 by Dell for $3.9 billion.\n\nAs a disruptive third-party candidate for president, Perot ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility and protectionism. He won nearly 19% of the vote in the 1992 race, making him the most successful third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party in the 1912 election.\n\nPerot was known for his quirks as much as his business credentials and lack of experience in establishment politics. \"I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else,\" he said in a 1992 presidential debate. The shifting of U.S. jobs to Mexico created a \"giant sucking sound,\" he famously said during the campaign.\n\nPerot participated in all three presidential debates in that election and took a nontraditional campaign route by booking lengthy time slots on network television to lay out his political views. Allan Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University, described Perot as \"the most influential political force in the late 20th century from outside the regular party system.\" Lichtman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he had been tapped to write a biography of Perot, but \"quirky Ross Perot, just like he pulled out of the presidential race, he pulled out of the biography,\" Lichtman said.\n\nPerot was a veteran and followed his service with a lifetime commitment to supporting U.S. veterans, especially during the Vietnam War. He was honored in 2009 by then-Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake for his advocacy efforts.",
    " Title: CBS Poll Shows Narrowed Advantage for Democrats in Midterm Elections Amidst Family Separation and Gun Control Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CBS poll published on Sunday indicates a narrowed advantage for the Democratic Party over the Republican Party in the upcoming midterm elections, with the Democrats' lead shrinking to four points. The poll, which surveyed 2,063 adults between June 21-22, 2018, shows 36 percent of respondents preferring to see Republicans maintain control of Congress, while 40 percent expressed a preference for Democrats.\n\nThe poll's findings are surprising given the significant public outcry against President Donald Trump's zero-tolerance policy, which resulted in the separation of families seeking illegal entry at the southern border. The poll notes that 73 percent of Americans oppose the separation of children from parents as a form of deterrence.\n\nHowever, the Democrats' advantage in the generic ballot has been declining throughout the year. In June, they held a 10-point advantage, according to an NBC poll, with 50 percent of registered voters wanting a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\nThe CBS poll also reveals a significant number of Trump supporters who opposed the zero-tolerance policy but did not hold the president responsible. The results suggest voters are compartmentalizing the issue, with many blaming the parents for bringing their children into the U.S. illegally.\n\nAnother factor affecting the Democrats' advantage is the gun control debate. According to a Washington Post poll in April, the gap between support for the two parties in House races has narrowed significantly since the gun control debate became a major issue following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. The poll suggests that nearly 40 percent of registered voters believe it is extremely important that political candidates share their views on gun control.\n\nThe CBS poll also found that voters in key states for the Democrats in the midterms, such as Texas, Florida, and Arizona, believe Hispanic illegal and legal immigrants have had a negative effect on their lives. Nearly four in ten say immigrants from Mexico and South America have made life worse, compared to a lower 33 percent among voters across the country. Republicans are particularly likely to say immigrants have negatively impacted their state.\n\nThese findings suggest a tightening race in the midterm elections, with both parties vying for the support of voters on key issues such as immigration and gun control. The midterm elections are scheduled to take place in November 2018.",
    " Title: President Obama Faces Historical Hurdle in Bid for Re-election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Charlotte, North Carolina, President Barack Obama faces a significant historical challenge in his bid for a second term. No incumbent president has ever been re-elected with unemployment as high as it is now, a statistic that harks back to Franklin D. Roosevelt's time in office.\n\nHowever, the president arrives at the convention with several key advantages in the race. While the unemployment rate in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office, was 8.3%, it remained at the same level in July 2012. This economic data, according to the Romney campaign, is evidence that Obama's economic policies have failed. The Obama team, in turn, argues that the president's policies are helping to pull the economy out of a deep recession he inherited.\n\nIncumbency is one of Obama's advantages. While there are downsides to this, the stage and powers of the presidency are generally an advantage, especially in a close, competitive race. Mitt Romney needs to win Florida and Ohio, and at least two of Virginia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, to have a realistic shot at 270 Electoral College votes and victory. Obama, on the other hand, enters his convention with several paths to cobble 270 together.\n\nDemographics also play a significant role in the 2012 race. As long as the GOP has a crisis with Latino voters, there is a built-in Democratic edge in several key states. New Mexico, not long ago a presidential swing state, is barely mentioned as a potential GOP target. And Nevada is a competitive tossup despite the highest unemployment rate among the states and a punishing housing crisis.\n\nThe economy is the driving force behind the very different 2012 map and mood. The jobless numbers and other economic data make it all but impossible for the president to make the case Americans are better off today than they were four years ago. So his convention priority is to make the case that his approach is the better, fairer path to sustained recovery. The primary target: independents and conservative Democrats in battleground states.\n\nThe vice president, Joe Biden, mockingly told a crowd in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Sunday, \"The thing I most love about them is how they discovered the middle class at their convention. Wasn't that amazing? All of a sudden their heart was bleeding for the middle class.\" Biden's comments underscore the importance of the fairness argument in the 2012 race.\n\nThe Obama campaign also understands the need to re-energize its 2008 base. \"Don't boo - vote,\" was the president's weekend appeal to a Colorado college audience, a snapshot of the 2012 nuts-and-bolts approach of a campaign team that understands it can not rely on the dynamics that motivated 2008 Obama voters.\n\nThe 2016 factor is also noteworthy in Charlotte, though likely somewhat less obvious than it was in Tampa. Joe and Jill Biden have busy schedules, and the vice president has a coveted speaking slot. Biden is 69, meaning he would be 73 at the 2016 convention, but he has not ruled out a third try for his party's presidential nomination.\n\nHillary Clinton will have no Charlotte role, inappropriate, she says, for a secretary of state. But as much as she says she is done with politics when this first Obama term ends, the convention has no shortage of Clinton loyalists, including her husband, the former president.\n\nFrom there, as in Tampa, the focus will be on ambitious next-generation prospects, among them Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, and, for the first time in years, perhaps a Cuomo - New York's governor, Andrew.\n\nTo look at a map searching for Democrats of the future, though, is to be reminded of a painful truth for the party gathering in Charlotte: President Obama is their undisputed leader, but the Obama presidency has been a time of deep Democratic decline. The Democrats currently hold 51 Senate seats (plus two independents who align mostly with the Democrats), 190 seats in the House of Representatives (there are also three vacancies for seats last held by Democrats), and 20 of the 50 governorships.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Files Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times Over Giffords Shooting Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is suing The New York Times for defamation over an editorial published on June 14, 2017, that falsely implicated her in the 2011 shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords. The lawsuit alleges that the NYT's editorial, which has since been updated, falsely claimed that Palin played a role in inciting the shooting.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the NYT's editorial stated that Palin was responsible for inciting Jared Loughner's shooting rampage at a political event in Tucson, Arizona, during which he shot nineteen people, severely wounding Giffords, and killing six, including Chief U.S. District Court Judge John Roll and a nine-year-old girl. However, the lawsuit states, there is no evidence to support the NYT's implication that Palin played a role in inciting the Giffords shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the NYT published the editorial despite knowing that the linchpin of its \"sickening pattern\" of politically-incited shootings was the false assertion that Palin incited Loughner to murder six people, among them a child and federal judge, and seriously wound numerous others.

    " Title: Trump Announces Plans for \"Second Step Act\" to Focus on Criminal Justice Reform and Reentry Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a celebratory event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump announced plans for a \"Second Step Act,\" following the successful passage of the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, in December. The president emphasized that the Second Step Act will focus on successful reentry and reducing unemployment for Americans with past criminal records.\n\nDuring the event, which also served as part of a broader Prison Reform Summit, the president highlighted the bipartisan nature of the bill and its positive impact on individuals and communities. Attorney General William Barr, who was present at the event, expects to release the full Mueller report by mid-April.\n\nThe First Step Act, one of the few major legislative accomplishments of the Trump administration thus far, has received praise from both sides of the political spectrum for its aims. The celebration of the bill comes as it seeks to provide prisoners who exhibit good behavior with the opportunity to shorten their sentences, particularly for nonviolent drug offenses. The law also aims to reduce recidivism, or the rate at which convicted individuals engage in further criminal activity upon release.\n\nDuring the event, the president welcomed on stage several individuals who had been released earlier due to the First Step Act. One such individual emphasized the need for a \"second step\" in the reform process.\n\nPresident Trump claimed that since he signed the First Step Act, more than 16,000 inmates have enrolled in drug treatment programs. However, one beneficiary of the law stated that for the law to be fully effective, it needs to be fully funded. The president's proposed budget, as reported by The Marshall Project, only provides a fraction of the funding called for in the legislation, with $14 million allocated compared to the $75 million per year over five years outlined in the First Step Act.\n\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, played a significant role in propelling the legislation last year, along with nonprofit and other outside groups. The bill overcame opposition from a handful of hard-right conservatives, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas).",
    " Title: New York Times' Benghazi Account: A Controversial Narrative Amidst Political Speculations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and political speculation, The New York Times has published a lengthy article on the 2012 Benghazi attack, focusing on the role of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The article, titled \"What Really Happened in Benghazi,\" has been met with skepticism and criticism, with many questioning its timing and the sources used.\n\nThe article, written by David Kirkpatrick, the Cairo bureau chief of The New York Times, aims to provide a fresh perspective on the events leading up to the attack, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya. The article offers new details about the attack, such as the description of a vase in the living room of the mother of one of the suspects, but these details have been met with criticism for their lack of relevance to the main narrative.\n\nThe article's timing, published during a typically slow news week, has raised eyebrows, with some seeing it as an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential race, in which Clinton is expected to be a major contender. The article's focus on the role of Islamic terrorism in the attack contrasts with the official narrative, which blamed the attack on a YouTube video, a narrative that has been widely discredited.\n\nThe article has been met with mixed reactions. While some have praised it for adding \"valuable insights,\" others have criticized it for being \"heavily reliant\" on sources who had a vested interest in the story. The article has been described as a \"whitewash\" by some, while others see it as an attempt to rewrite history.\n\nThe Benghazi attack remains a contentious issue, with many questioning the actions of the Obama administration in the lead-up to the attack and in the aftermath. The article's publication has reignited these debates, with many questioning the motives behind its publication and the accuracy of its content. The article's impact on Clinton's presidential campaign remains to be seen, but it has certainly added fuel to the ongoing political fire surrounding the Benghazi attack.",
    " Title: Portland Train Attack: Community Mourns Heroes, Calls for Presidential Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a violent attack on a Portland, Oregon train that left three men dead and another severely injured, the community is mourning the heroes who intervened in the incident.\n\nTaliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, a recent college graduate, and Ricky John Best, 53, an army veteran and father-of-four, were killed, while Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, is recovering after sustaining a knife wound to his neck. The attack occurred on Friday when the three men intervened after a man launched into a verbal tirade against two teenage girls, one of whom was wearing a hijab.\n\nThe 35-year-old suspect, who allegedly said \"all Muslims should die\" during the attack, is due to appear in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation, and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon. The FBI is still investigating whether the suspect will face additional charges for a hate crime.\n\nMicah Fletcher, who is recovering, posted a picture from his hospital bed on Saturday evening, alongside a poem that read, \"I spat in the eye of hate and lived.\" The three men have been hailed as \"heroes\" in their local community, with Destinee Mangum, the 16-year-old who was traveling with her friend when the attack took place, expressing her gratitude.\n\n\"I just want to say thank you to the people who put their life on the line for me, because they didn't even know me and they lost their lives because of me and my friend and the way we look,\" she told local channel KPTV.\n\nA vigil was held on Saturday evening for Mr. Namkai-Meche and Mr. Best, with close to 1,000 people gathering to remember the two men. Tributes have also poured in online, with the city's mayor, Oregon governor Kate Brown, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton among those paying tribute.\n\n\"No one should have to endure this racist abuse,\" Clinton wrote on Twitter. \"No one should have to give their life to stop it.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the attack, with a tweet by a reporter asking for his comment receiving over 4,000 likes. Veteran journalist Dan Rather wrote an open letter to President Trump, which has been shared over 100,000 times on Facebook, imploring the president to speak out about the deaths.\n\n\"Two Americans have died leaving family and friends behind,\" wrote Mr. Rather. \"They are mourned by millions more who are also deeply worried about what might come next. I hope you can find it worthy of your time to take notice.\"",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate Preview: Pence Expected to Outshine Kaine in Tuesday's Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's vice presidential debate in Farmville, Virginia, between Indiana Governor Mike Pence and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine is anticipated to be a significant event in the ongoing presidential race. With both candidates boasting impressive political resumes, the debate could potentially overshadow the presidential bouts.\n\nSince the announcement of their respective running mates in July, the vice presidential candidates have had contrasting campaign trails. While Pence has been a hit on the campaign circuit, drawing large crowds across the country, Kaine has struggled to attract attendees, even in swing states where the contest is closest.\n\nPence's campaign appearances have been marked by his ability to connect with audiences, while Kaine's notable contributions to his party's efforts have been his accusations against Donald Trump's alleged association with the Ku Klux Klan and his defense of Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information.\n\nPence's presence on the campaign trail has reassured the public that Trump would appoint competent individuals to high posts and would be replaced by a capable leader if necessary. On the other hand, Kaine's performance has been perceived as a net negative for the Clinton campaign, with many questioning his ability to lead the country.\n\nIn the upcoming debate, Kaine is expected to present a series of attack lines against Trump to reinforce Clinton's points from the last debate. Pence's role will be to project a presidential demeanor, a task that Kaine's performance is likely to make easier.\n\nWhile vice presidential debates are often considered less impactful, they can influence a campaign's momentum. In 2008, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's performance in the vice presidential debate revitalized the McCain-Palin ticket, and in 2012, Vice President Joe Biden's debate performance helped put Barack Obama's re-election effort back on track after a disappointing first debate.\n\nPence's performance in the debate could potentially raise questions about Hillary Clinton's health and judgment, which Trump has repeatedly questioned. This could set Trump up for the remaining two debates and potentially lead to a surge in the polls.\n\nJoel B. Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588, believes that Pence's performance could significantly impact the race.

    " Title: Study Finds Google News Allegedly Skewed Towards Liberal Bias, Raising Questions About Neutrality\n\nIn a recent report, media technology group AllSides has claimed that Google News' homepage results are biased towards liberal news outlets. The two-week study found that out of 123 individual measurements, 65% of the news links provided were liberal, while only 16% were conservative. This 4-to-1 ratio suggests a significant lean towards left-leaning news sources.\n\nThe study, which analyzed the positioning of news, found that left-wing news tended to appear in the top two results, while right-wing news was consistently placed 12 positions down, below the fold. AllSides concluded that the study's results \"are so significantly strong and consistent in favor of news media sources from the left that the overall conclusion of a leftward bias is well justified.\"\n\nThe study noted that popular news outlets such as ABC, Buzzfeed, CBS, CNN, NBC, NPR, Politico, Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Huffington Post were heavily favored, while sites like Breitbart, The Blaze, The Daily Caller, Fox News, and the National Review were rarely seen at the top of the list. Even news sources considered to be in the center, such as NPR, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, and BBC, were not necessarily neutral, according to the study.\n\nThe study found that 91% of the 123 measurements indicated at least some preference for news media with a left bias over sources with a right bias. Furthermore, 80% of the measurements preferred left-wing news over news from a center source.\n\nAllSides CEO John Gable stated, \"Right now, technology overly puts a spotlight on the most popular perspective, or the perspective that most fits you, and that cuts out other perspectives. It reduces an individual's ability to decide for themselves or know the whole story.\"\n\nGoogle responded to the allegations, stating that \"search is not used to set a political agenda.\" The search engine company also denied any bias towards a political ideology. The full implications of these findings and Google's response remain to be seen.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama to Unite Democrats in Philadelphia as DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz Resigns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to display unity and contrast with the Republican infighting at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and First Lady Michelle Obama will deliver crucial opening night addresses to delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday. The convention got off to a rocky start on Sunday, with Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz being forced to announce her resignation following revelations of bias against Sanders during the primary contest with Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn his address, Sanders will emphasize the superiority of Clinton over Donald Trump on key issues such as economics, healthcare, education, and the environment. Sanders' spokesman, Michael Briggs, stated, \"Sanders will make it clear that Hillary Clinton is by far superior to Donald Trump on every major issue from economics and health care to education and the environment.\"\n\nIn a surprisingly muted response to Wasserman Schultz's resignation, Sanders said she had made the right decision but paid tribute to her \"years of service.\" Despite tense relations between the campaigns during the primary fight, Sanders has swiftly backed Clinton since a full-throated endorsement speech two weeks ago in New Hampshire.\n\nSanders will highlight the progressive platform agreed upon with Clinton, which includes expanding healthcare access and making public colleges tuition-free for students from families with annual incomes up to $125,000 a year. He will also criticize Trump for siding with the Koch brothers and echoing fossil fuel industry claims that climate change is a hoax.\n\nSome Sanders supporters remain angry over the DNC email revelations, and there was an ambivalent atmosphere at some events in Philadelphia on Sunday evening. Some activists planned demonstrations and sit-ins in protest against the party's continued use of superdelegates in its nominating process. However, the Sanders campaign appears satisfied with the outcome of a rules committee meeting on Saturday that proposed a commission to reduce the number of superdelegates in primary contests.\n\nJeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, stated, \"This is a tremendous victory for Senator Sanders' fight to democratize the Democratic party and reform the Democratic nominating process.\" Sanders will use his speech to encourage supporters to continue pushing their agenda outside the mainstream.\n\n\"[He] will send a message to the convention and to the 13 million voters who supported him that they have begun a political revolution to transform America and that the revolution \u2013 Our Revolution \u2013 continues,\" said Briggs. \"Together,\" Sanders will say, \"we continue the fight to create a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1% \u2013 a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.\"",
    " Title: \"Seattle Flu Study: Delayed COVID-19 Testing Due to FDA and CDC Regulations\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Seattle Flu Study, an ongoing research project on influenza, could have provided an early warning for the detection and monitoring of COVID-19 cases in the United States. However, as reported by The New York Times, officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hindered the development of diagnostic tests that might have offered an early warning and a head start in controlling the current nationwide epidemic.\n\nIn January, Seattle infectious disease expert Dr. Helen Chu had collected a large number of nasal swabs from local residents experiencing symptoms as part of her research project. Proposing to test these samples for coronavirus infections, Chu and her team were told by federal and state officials that they could not do so unless their laboratory test was approved by the FDA. The FDA refused to approve Chu's test, citing that her lab was not certified as a clinical laboratory under regulations established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a process that could take months.\n\nWhile the CDC insisted on a centralized testing regime, their diagnostic test released on February 5 turned out to be flawed. This centralized approach significantly slowed down the process of disease detection as the infection rate was accelerating.\n\nFrustrated, Chu and her colleagues began testing on February 25 without government approval. They almost immediately detected a coronavirus infection in a local teenager with no recent travel history. Chu's lab's finding and the teenager's school closure strongly suggested that the disease had been circulating throughout the western part of Washington for weeks.\n\nDespite Chu's proactive approach, Washington state epidemiologist Scott Lindquist recalled, \"What they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to Helen Chu. Stop testing.\" On February 29, the FDA finally agreed to allow biotech companies and academic labs in the U.S. to develop and deploy new tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe Seattle Flu Study serves as a stark example of how existing regulations and red tape, designed to protect privacy and health, have impeded the rapid rollout of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up testing much earlier and faster. Faced with a public health emergency on a scale potentially not seen in a century, the United States has not responded nimbly.\n\nAs a result of red tape, the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. will likely be worse than it should have been.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Argues for DACA Program's Invalidity, Citing Policy and Legal Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Trump administration has connected the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to the surge of unaccompanied minors and families at the U.S.-Mexico border, in new court documents filed on Friday. The documents outline the administration's reasons for seeking the invalidation of DACA.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen argued that a lenient stance on immigration sends the wrong message, and the government must terminate the DACA program to rectify this. In a memo, she stated, \"Considering the fact that tens of thousands of minor aliens have illegally crossed or been smuggled across our border in recent years and then have been released into the country owing to loopholes in our laws... it is critically important for DHS to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws against all classes and categories of aliens.\"\n\nThe document aims to expand on the justification then-acting Secretary Elaine Duke gave last September when she announced a phaseout of the DACA program. Several federal judges have ruled her decision to be poorly thought out, relying on the fear of a legal defeat in the courts to scrap the program.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who won one of those court injunctions halting the Trump phaseout, described the new filing as misguided. \"The Trump Administration doubling down on its decision to terminate the DACA program is based on its flawed conclusion that DACA is unlawful,\" he said.\n\nBecerra's legal team successfully argued that DACA recipients have built up a legal interest in the program, states and communities rely on them as legal workers, and the program cannot be stripped away without the government going through the full process of notice and comment.\n\nThe Trump administration, in the new memo, argues that from the time the Obama administration started DACA in 2012, it stated the program could be revoked at any time and was always meant to be temporary. Ms. Nielsen presented both legal and policy arguments for why DACA is bad policy and bad legally.\n\nShe admitted that the Dreamers who apply for DACA are \"sympathetic\" figures, but said that's not a sufficient reason for the administration to usurp powers that rightly belong to Congress. The DACA program granted a two-year renewable stay of deportation, and those who qualified were also given work permits, entitling them to driver's licenses and some taxpayer benefits.\n\nMore than 800,000 people were approved for the program, and nearly 700,000 were still being protected under it as of several months ago. Ms. Nielsen argued that there's nothing wrong with granting special relief to Dreamers on a case-by-case basis, but she said DACA was a categorical program that saw applications of people who met the age and education requirements virtually rubber-stamped.\n\nShe said such decisions on big programs like that should come from Congress, not the executive branch. While several judges have ruled the Trump phaseout illegal, Texas and several other states have filed a lawsuit arguing the original DACA program itself is illegal. Should Texas win that case, it could create a bizarre situation where DACA is illegal, but so is getting rid of it.",
    " Title: Andrew Cuomo's Third Term and Presidential Ambitions: A Tale of Unfulfilled Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nAndrew Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, faced a significant shift in his political career during his third term in office. Once a formidable figure in New York politics, Cuomo found himself grappling with declining popularity ratings and increased opposition from state legislators.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Cuomo attributed the erosion of his support to the media's coverage of his potential presidential run. He expressed frustration, stating, \"You\u2019ve done everything but call me a liar. You said that I was cute. You said that I misplayed the game. You said that I was really waiting for another scenario. Well, the net result of that is it costs me credibility, because you spent all those months saying I was conning people.\"\n\nDespite the looming recession and declining state revenues, Cuomo managed to secure a third term in 1990, defeating Pierre A. Rinfret, a financial consultant and economics adviser to presidents. However, his victory was not as decisive as his previous one, with Cuomo performing better against his 1986 opponent, Mario M. O'Rourke.\n\nUpon his return to Albany to deliver his ninth State of the State address, Cuomo hinted at scaled-down ambitions for his next term. \"This is a wonderful year for raw truth,\" he said. \"We don\u2019t have any money.\"\n\nIn October 1991, during a trip to Chicago, Cuomo fueled speculation about a potential presidential run, stating he was \"looking at\" a run. However, many of his supporters grew weary of such talk, viewing it as a strategy to revitalize his political image. In December of the same year, with presidential aspirations still unrealized, Cuomo announced yet again that he would not be a candidate for president.\n\nReflecting on these events years later, Cuomo expressed regret that his intentions were not taken at face value. In an interview for his obituary, he stated, \"I would have run [for president], had Republicans simply agreed to my request to pass a budget.\" The former governor's political career, marked by ambition and controversy, ultimately ended with his resignation in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations.",
    " Title: Economic Impact of COVID-19 Control Measures: A Balanced Approach to Public Health and Economic Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed concerns that the measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, business closures, and stay-at-home orders, could have a more detrimental impact on the economy than the disease itself. Economists predict that the economic fallout from the pandemic could be as severe as or worse than the Great Recession of 2008-09, which cost the U.S. an estimated $22 trillion.\n\nWhen evaluating health and safety regulations, government agencies typically consider not only the number of lives saved but the cost of implementing such measures. This approach ensures that finite resources are allocated effectively, potentially saving more lives by investing in other areas.\n\nA rough calculation based on the \"value of a statistical life\" (VSL) used by the Environmental Protection Agency to assess proposed regulations suggests that the cost of COVID-19 deaths in the worst-case scenario, as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would be substantial: approximately $13.6 trillion. However, if economic projections are accurate, the cost of aggressive COVID-19 control measures will likely exceed this figure.\n\nThis comparison assumes that government intervention will be completely successful in preventing those deaths, which is not the case, and it uses a VSL that may be excessive in this context, as COVID-19 fatalities are primarily concentrated among the elderly, resulting in fewer years of life lost on average. Furthermore, the worst-case scenario, which envisions 214 million infections (65% of the population) and 1.7 million deaths, may be unrealistic.\n\nThe true case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19, although likely higher than the CFR for seasonal flu (about 0.1%), is likely to be much lower than the rates suggested by official numbers, which only include confirmed cases. Since COVID-19 symptoms are typically mild to nonexistent, the actual number of infections is bound to be much higher.\n\nAssistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir estimates that the best estimates for the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 are somewhere between 0.1% and 1%. John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Stanford University, calculates that \"reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.\"\n\nThe CDC's projection implies a COVID-19 CFR of 0.8%, near the high end of these ranges. The scenario also assumes that voluntary measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19, such as avoiding crowds, limiting social interactions, and practicing good hygiene, have no impact on transmission.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty surrounding these projections, and public officials may believe they are acting cautiously. However, this is only true if one ignores the potentially devastating impact of disrupting economic transactions, shutting down businesses, and depriving millions of people of their livelihoods.\n\nIoannidis warns that if the CFR for COVID-19 is much lower than many people fear, \"locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational.\" David Katz, founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, advocates for a more targeted approach that focuses on protecting the most at-risk individuals, expressing concern that the social, economic, and public health consequences of the current near-total shutdown of normal life \"will be long-lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself.\"\n\nIn navigating the response to COVID-19, there are no easy answers. However, wise policy begins by acknowledging the trade-offs that politicians have thus far overlooked.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Agreement on $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Package Nears as U.S. Congress Approaches Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Senior Democrats and Republicans have reportedly reached a preliminary agreement on a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package, raising hopes that the U.S. Congress could soon take action to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in Congress, stated during Tuesday's Senate session that they are \"very close\" to reaching a deal, using a football analogy to describe their progress. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, echoed this sentiment, expressing optimism that a deal could be finalized within a few hours.\n\nThe agreement reportedly includes more oversight provisions for a $500 billion fund to aid hard-hit businesses, addressing a key point of contention between the two parties. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed these changes, stating that there will be \"better oversight\" for the industry fund.\n\nDemocrats had previously blocked the bill twice, citing insufficient funding for states and hospitals, inadequate aid for unemployed Americans, and a lack of oversight for a massive fund to aid big businesses. However, it appears that these concerns have been addressed in the emerging bipartisan bill.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat, expressed optimism that a deal would be announced Tuesday morning. If successful, the bill would be the third and largest package passed to address the crisis, requiring approval from both the Republican-majority Senate, the Democratic-majority House, and President Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Trump has urged Congress to act swiftly, stating on Twitter that \"Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today.\" The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in over 550 deaths and sickened more than 43,800 people in the United States, causing widespread business closures, job losses, and stay-at-home orders affecting nearly a third of the nation's population.\n\nDetails of the emerging bipartisan bill are not yet available, but it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work due to the virus and assistance for struggling industries such as airlines. The bill is also expected to include provisions for mail-in voting in the November presidential and congressional elections, a proposal introduced by House Speaker Pelosi in her $2.5 trillion counterproposal.\n\nThe agreement, if finalized, would mark a significant bipartisan effort to address the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The bill's progress comes as the U.S. grapples with the ongoing health and economic crisis, with the number of cases and deaths continuing to rise.",
    " Title: Speaker John Boehner Announces Special Committee to Investigate Benghazi Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing standoff between Congress and the White House, Speaker of the House John Boehner announced the creation of a special select committee to investigate the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\n\nThe decision, announced on Friday, follows a week of hints from Boehner that he would establish a panel to probe the attacks, which occurred during his first few years in power. The GOP majority, now predominantly focused on oversight, is shifting its attention from budget negotiations with President Barack Obama to investigative work.\n\nInitially reluctant to create a select committee, Boehner's decision was influenced by the Obama administration's perceived lack of cooperation with Congress and the release of emails obtained by the government watchdog group Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, which House panels had been unable to receive despite issuing a subpoena.\n\nRep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the party's chief deputy whip, stated, \"The speaker was reluctant to do this, it's not something he was celebrating or anxious to do, even with earlier calls for it. But when the White House is releasing information in discovery in lawsuits that they are not releasing to Congress, that is a very serious breakdown that has to be dealt with. The speaker had a choice.\"\n\nThe House will vote on a resolution to create the committee on Thursday. Boehner has been preparing for this move for some time, consulting with key figures involved in the Benghazi probes, including Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who had previously proposed his own bill to create a special Benghazi panel. Boehner is expected to appoint Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) as the committee's chairman.\n\nThe creation of the select committee marks a significant shift in the House Republican's focus, with the party now prioritizing oversight over budget negotiations. The move also underscores Boehner's evolution as speaker, transitioning from a focus on negotiating a budget-balancing fiscal deal with President Obama to a more investigative role.",
    " Title: Opinion: Trump Derangement Syndrome: A Real and Palpable Phenomenon\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political discourse, the term \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" is not merely a catchy phrase, but a tangible and perceptible phenomenon. This was recently demonstrated in an article by Paul Waldman of The American Prospect, who expressed his disdain for President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nWaldman's piece, titled \"The Impeachment of Donald Trump and the Contamination of Our Emotional Lives,\" paints a grim picture of the Trump presidency, stating that it has brought about a sense of dread, despair, and disillusionment. He argues that Trump's accountability has been in short supply, citing the ongoing impeachment proceedings as an opportunity for the president to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the Democrats have been pursuing Trump since his candidacy, with the Russia investigation being a prime example of this pursuit. Despite two years of investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. This raises questions about the Democrats' accountability for wasting taxpayers' time and resources on a baseless investigation.\n\nWaldman's piece also touches on Trump's alleged offensive tweets, racism, and cruelty. It is true that some of Trump's tweets have been controversial, but it is also important to consider the context and intent behind these tweets. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Democrats have been accused of similar behavior, yet have not been held to the same level of scrutiny.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable for individuals to have differing opinions on President Trump, it is important to approach political discourse with a sense of fairness and objectivity. It is also important to hold all parties accountable for their actions, not just the president. The impeachment proceedings should be a time for accountability, but it is crucial to remember that accountability is a two-way street.",
    " Title: Oregon Senate Republicans Absent from State Capitol to Prevent Cap-and-Trade Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unique turn of events, all 11 Oregon Senate Republicans have left the state to avoid a vote on a controversial cap-and-trade legislation, aiming to stall the bill until the legislative session adjourns on June 30. Senate Republican Whip Dennis Linthicum announced on Friday that the legislators have no plans to return, despite Democratic Governor Kate Brown's deployment of state troopers to bring them back to the state capitol in Salem.\n\nLinthicum stated, \"Senate Republicans will run out the clock on the legislative session as the state budget is fine and funded until this storm of false narratives and intimidation passes.\" The Senate Republicans' whereabouts remain secret, according to Linthicum's spokesman, Jonathan Lockwood.\n\nSen. Herman Baertschiger, an Oregon Republican, expressed his willingness to return if the Democrats agreed to let the public decide by referring the cap-and-trade plan to the ballot. Baertschiger stated, \"I think the Republicans would really take that into consideration. Obviously, I\u2019m not with all my members, and that would be a membership discussion. That would be good enough for me.\"\n\nDemocrats have accused the Senate Republicans of playing hooky. The Oregon Democratic Party posted a \"wanted\" sign with the names and photos of the Republican legislators, labeling them \"fugitives from justice (and their jobs)!\" The Democrats tweeted, \"Every day that Oregon Senate Republicans refuse to do their jobs has serious consequences for our climate.\"\n\nIf passed, H.B. 2020 would make Oregon the second state, after California, with a cap-and-trade program. The program aims to lower greenhouse-gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 to combat climate change. However, Republicans argue it would strangle economic growth and kill jobs, costing the average family of four at least $600 per year.\n\nThe Senate Democrats have 18 members, but need 20 members to establish a quorum. If a quorum cannot be reached due to the Senate Republicans' absence, the Democrats may not be able to pass the bill. The Senate Republicans could potentially be fined $500 per day for each day they are absent, according to Senate President Peter Courtney.\n\nThe standoff between the Senate Republicans and Democrats has sparked protests, with hundreds of protesters, led by loggers and a convoy of truckers, turning out Wednesday to voice their concerns about the bill. Baertschiger, who has been vocal about his opposition to the bill, stated, \"When you have a bill that is this enormous\u2014this changes everybody\u2019s lives in the state of Oregon\u2014I\u2019m not going to be part of letting that being passed.\"",
    " Title: Jared Kushner's Top-Level Security Clearance Revoked, White House Staff to Use Lower Level Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has reportedly lost the top-level security clearance he has been using on an interim basis to perform his duties within the White House. According to reports on Tuesday, Kushner will now operate with a lower level of access to classified information, similar to other White House staffers who had temporary clearances.\n\nPreviously, Kushner held a top-secret clearance with access to Special Compartmented Information, known as TS/SCI. Now, he and other officials will use a lower clearance, a secret clearance, which restricts the amount of material they can access.\n\nThe news was first reported by Politico. The reports emerged ahead of a deadline by which the White House had been asked to submit information about its clearance protocols to the House Oversight Committee.\n\nAnother story on Tuesday raised new questions about Kushner's future inside the White House. The Washington Post reported that foreign officials have discussed among themselves how they might be able to manipulate Kushner by taking advantage of his finances, business dealings, or his lack of experience in foreign policy and government.\n\nFor now, Kushner is expected to continue working in his unpaid role as a senior adviser to Trump, despite losing this round in a dispute with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. The two men have been at odds over access to the president and the nature of their jobs. Trump said last week he trusted Kelly to settle the dispute.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly, in an earlier statement, declined to comment on any one person's security clearance. However, he did say, \"As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico.\"\n\nKelly had set Friday as the deadline to discontinue any top-secret or higher-level interim clearances for individuals whose background investigations had been pending since June 1, 2017, or before.\n\nKushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that there is a backlog in the process for securing a permanent clearance. \"Mr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process,\" Lowell said in a statement provided to NPR. \"Those involved in the process again have confirmed that there are dozens of people at Mr. Kushner's level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for these clearance reviews to take this long in a new administration, and that the current backlogs are now being addressed. No concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner's application.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) commented on the change in Kushner's access to sensitive information, stating, \"Downgrading Jared Kushner's security clearance gives new meaning to the term 'overdue.'\" Blumenthal further added, \"Kushner's access to highly sensitive, classified information should have been not just downgraded, but eliminated long ago. There is no reasonable justification for a yearlong policy that allowed people who may have very harmful secrets in their own backgrounds to have access to our nation's secrets.\"\n\nThe resignation of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter had revealed that a number of people on staff had never received full, permanent clearances, meaning they were accessing national security and other secret information even after questions had been raised during background checks about their ability to qualify to do so.\n\nThe Porter scandal embarrassed Kelly and the White House after Trump and Republicans had made the handling of secrets such a focus of their 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, who operated a private email server while she served as secretary of state. Clinton was repeatedly faulted during the campaign about what critics called her slipshod approach to handling sensitive information.",
    " Title: Arkansas Senate Overrides Veto, Advances Bills Restricting Abortions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Arkansas Senate, in a party-line vote, overrode Governor Mike Beebe's veto of a bill that imposes near-total abortion bans starting from the 20th week of pregnancy, and also advanced a separate measure that would outlaw most abortions from the 12th week.\n\nThe Senate, led by the Republican party, voted 19-14 to override the veto of the 20-week bill on Thursday, a day after the Republican-led state House also voted to override it. The 20-week law, which took immediate effect, is based on the contested claim that fetuses can feel pain by the 20th week.\n\nSenate President Michael Lamoureux, a Republican from Russellville, supported the override but expressed doubts about the bill's constitutionality after the vote. \"If it was an easy answer, then people wouldn't be raising that subject,\" he said.\n\nMinutes after overriding Beebe's veto, the Senate voted 26-8 in favor of a bill that would outlaw most abortions starting from the 12th week of pregnancy, sending it back to Beebe for his consideration. He has until next week to decide whether to sign or veto the bill.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already announced its intention to challenge either the 20-week or 12-week bills if they become law, and opponents of the legislation are expected to seek an injunction barring enforcement of the new restrictions pending the outcome of the expected legal challenge.\n\nGovernor Beebe has expressed concerns that the new law contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion until a fetus can viably survive outside the womb, typically at 22 to 24 weeks. He has stated that the state will waste money trying to defend it.\n\nSen. Bruce Maloch, a Democrat from Magnolia, previously voted for the 20-week ban but voted against the override out of deference to Beebe and the concerns he raised over the measure's constitutionality. \"These bills are a real dilemma for people who are pro-life, but still, there are constitutional concerns. It does really tear at you,\" Maloch said.\n\nThe near-ban of abortions starting from the 20th week of pregnancy is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by then and therefore deserves protection from abortion. Seven states have enacted similar 20-week restrictions based on the fetal pain argument, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks laws affecting women's health. A similar law in Arizona has been blocked while a federal appeals court reviews a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe 12-week bill is based on the argument that a fetus should be protected from abortion once its heartbeat can be detected during an abdominal ultrasound. The governor has not stated whether he will veto the bill but has expressed constitutional concerns with the measure.\n\nSen. Jason Rapert, the Republican sponsor of the 12-week ban, said Beebe should let the measure go into law without his signature. \"I respect his opinions and what he has to do as an individual, but I believe he should honor the vote of the Legislature,\" Rapert told reporters after the vote.",
    " Title: Trump's Ongoing Frustration with Russia Investigation Mounts\n\nArticle:\n\nFor several months, President Donald Trump has expressed his discontent with the ongoing investigations into his administration. He has occasionally brought up the topic unprompted in conversations with associates and allies, asserting, \"I'm not under investigation.\"\n\nThe most apparent sign that Trump is growing increasingly impatient with the investigation, often referred to as the \"Rosenstein button\" next to the one that summons a Coke, is his recent focus on the idea that the investigation has reached its conclusion.\n\nIn a tweet on June 16, 2017, Trump stated, \"After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!\"\n\nTrump's assertion of the investigation's duration is not specific about the source of the \"7 months,\" but his point is clear: he believes the investigation has gone on long enough. While the Whitewater investigation persisted for more than four years before Ken Starr uncovered the infamous blue dress, this is the kind of length Trump aims to avoid. He wants the investigation to conclude before Special Counsel Robert Mueller delves too deeply into his financial dealings and before the investigation recruits enough accountants and lawyers to scrutinize his financial records more closely.\n\nTrump has also expressed to friends and associates that the investigation is a \"witch hunt\" and that others are out to get him. \"It's basically all he talks about on the phone,\" said one adviser who has spoken with Trump and his top aides.\n\nTrump's surrogates at all levels have been pushing the argument that Mueller is biased\u2014having hired individuals who contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign\u2014and that the investigation is a sham. The possibility of political backlash, or at least the potential for negative consequences if one Republican in Washington could locate a copy of the U.S. Constitution, does not seem to deter Trump. Because Trump is not acting from a rational perspective, weighing the consequences or looking to the future, he wants Mueller removed, and there is only so long his staff will hold him back.",
    " Title: Historic Upset in Virginia's 7th Congressional District: Eric Cantor Loses Primary to Dave Brat\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), the sitting Majority Leader of the House, has lost his primary election to Professor Dave Brat (R-VA) in Virginia's 7th Congressional District. This unexpected outcome, described by elections expert Sean Trende as the \"biggest House upset\" he's ever seen, has left political pundits and Cantor's team stunned.\n\nDespite a significant financial advantage, Cantor outspent Brat by nearly $1.2 million in the last seven weeks, yet the sitting House Majority Leader was defeated in a race many had expected him to win comfortably. A recent poll had shown a potential tightening of the race, but Cantor still held a double-digit lead.\n\nThe upset can be attributed to discontent within the solidly Republican, suburban Richmond 7th Congressional District. Brat, the Republican nominee, capitalized on voter dissatisfaction by attacking Cantor on his votes to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown, as well as his support for some immigration reforms.\n\nAt a May meeting of Republican activists in the district, Cantor was booed, and an ally he campaigned for was ousted as the local party chairman in favor of a tea party favorite.\n\nAs of now, it remains unclear whether there is a Democratic candidate in the race, a fact that, according to Sean Trende, is not promising if there is one. This unexpected defeat effectively ends any chance of Immigration Reform in the near future, as acknowledged by political analyst Chuck Todd.\n\nThis historic upset serves as a reminder to take nothing for granted in politics, even in what appears to be a safe seat. The full story can be found on Dave Brat's campaign website.",
    " Title: Deadly Train Accident in Western India Kills 16 Migrant Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nA tragic incident occurred in western India on Friday, as a train ran over a group of migrant workers sleeping on the tracks, killing at least 16 and injuring two others, according to officials. The incident took place in Maharashtra state, where tens of thousands of laborers have been walking home from major cities due to job losses caused by a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Railways Minister, Piyush Goyal, expressed his condolences on Twitter, stating, \"I have just heard the sad news about laborers coming under the train, rescue work is underway.\" The Railways Ministry has ordered an inquiry into the incident, with the driver of the freight train reportedly trying to stop but failing to do so in time.\n\nThe laborers were reportedly employees of a steel company and were walking towards their village in the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh. According to a police officer, the workers had been walking all night and were exhausted, causing them to fall asleep on the tracks. The lack of public transport during the lockdown may have led the workers to underestimate the risk of trains moving.\n\nThe opposition and activists have criticized the government for arranging planes to bring back Indians from overseas while leaving migrant workers stranded in big cities with limited access to food and cash. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his \"anguish at the loss of lives\" in the accident and promised to provide all necessary assistance.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, expressed his shock at the deaths of the migrant workers and stated, \"We should be ashamed of how we treat our nation-builders.\" Over the past week, some state governments have organized trains and buses to bring back migrant workers, but many are still walking long distances in the blistering heat to reach their homes.\n\nIndia's railway network is one of the largest in the world, carrying approximately 23 million passengers a day. Accidents are common, with most being attributed to poor maintenance and human error. A 2012 government report described the loss of 15,000 passengers to rail accidents every year in India as a \"massacre.\"",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Acknowledges Potential Premium Increases in Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising admission, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act, often criticized for its high costs, may not be as affordable as initially perceived. The secretary's remarks come as insurers prepare to release rates for health plans starting January 1, 2014, when key provisions of the health law take effect.\n\nSebelius' comments suggest that individuals purchasing new insurance policies could face premium increases due to requirements in the health-care law. She noted that the law mandates improved benefits and equal treatment for all customers, regardless of their medical claims.\n\n\"These folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the first time, and so there may be a higher cost associated with getting into that market,\" Sebelius said. \"But we feel pretty strongly that with subsidies available to a lot of that population, they are really going to see much better benefits for the money that they're spending.\"\n\nHowever, the issue of premium increases has been a sensitive topic for the Obama administration, which has relied on elements in the health law designed to increase competition among insurers to keep rates in check. The administration has pointed to subsidies that will be available for many lower-income Americans to help them with the cost of coverage.\n\nThe secretary's remarks are among the first direct statements from federal officials that people who have less comprehensive health plans could face higher premiums for more generous plans. The concern is that forcing consumers into plans they may not need or afford is counterproductive.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey of more than 600 doctors found a pessimistic outlook on the future of medicine, citing eroding autonomy and falling income. The survey, from Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, found that six in 10 physicians (62 percent) said it is likely many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years.\n\nAnother 55 percent of surveyed doctors believe others will scale back hours because of the way medicine is changing, but the survey did not elaborate greatly on the changes. Three-quarters think the best and brightest may not consider a career in medicine, although that is an increase from the 2011 survey result of 69 percent.\n\nThe survey also found that about two-thirds of the responders believed physicians and hospitals would become more integrated in coming years, with nearly eight in 10 believing midlevel providers would play a larger role in directing primary care.\n\nFurthermore, biomedical or medical device engineering firms are already laying off workers who develop crucial medical products due to the costs of the medical device tax in ObamaCare. The more money these companies pay to the government, the less money they have to invest in research and development.\n\nThe Obama administration is no longer trying to deny the potential premium increases in the Affordable Care Act, instead focusing on the subsidies available to help lower-income Americans afford the increased costs. However, the long-term effects of the law on the medical profession and the development of life-saving medical devices remain a concern.",
    " Title: Canada Rejoins USMCA Trade Agreement After Intense Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nCanada has re-entered the North American free trade agreement with the United States and Mexico following weeks of intense, high-stress negotiations that came close to a midnight deadline. In a joint statement, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland announced the agreement, stating it \"will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\"\n\nThe new deal, reached just before the midnight deadline set by the U.S., will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It replaces the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which President Donald Trump had previously labeled a \"job-killing disaster.\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump described the agreement as a \"great deal,\" tweeting that it \"solves the many deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduces Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations together in competition with the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe agreement reached on Sunday grants U.S. farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market. However, it maintains the NAFTA dispute-resolution process that the U.S. sought to eliminate and offers Canada protection if Trump proceeds with plans to impose tariffs on cars, trucks, and auto parts imported into the United States.\n\n\"It's a good day for Canada,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he left his office. Trudeau indicated he would have more to say on Monday.\n\n\"We celebrate a trilateral deal. The door closes on trade fragmentation in the region,\" Jesus Seade, trade negotiator for Mexico's incoming president, said via Twitter. Representatives for the government of Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have called a press conference to discuss details of the trade deal on Monday.\n\nCanada, the United States' second-largest trading partner, was excluded when the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp NAFTA. The Trump administration officially notified Congress of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement on Aug. 31. This started a 90-day clock that would allow outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to sign the new pact before he leaves office on Dec. 1.\n\nTrump threatened to proceed with a revamped NAFTA, with or without Canada. It was unclear, however, whether Trump had the authority from Congress to pursue a revamped NAFTA with only Mexico.\n\nSome lawmakers expressed relief that Canada had been reinstated in the regional trading bloc. \"I am pleased that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal to modernize NAFTA with both Mexico and Canada,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). \"NAFTA is a proven success.\"\n\nNAFTA dismantled most trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, leading to a surge in trade between the three countries. However, Trump and other critics argued that it encouraged manufacturers to move south of the border to take advantage of low-wage Mexican wages, costing American jobs.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to rewrite NAFTA - or get rid of it. Talks on a rewrite began more than a year ago. To appease Trump, Mexico agreed in August to provisions that would require 40 percent to 45 percent of a car to be built in countries where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour to qualify for NAFTA's duty-free benefits.\n\nIt was surprising that the United States found it easier to cut a deal with Mexico than with Canada, a longtime ally with a high-wage economy similar to America's. \"When this got started, Canada was the teacher's pet, and Mexico was the problem child,\" said Michael Camunez, president of Monarch Global Strategies and former U.S. Commerce Department official.\n\nHowever, relations between Ottawa and Washington soured. In the aftermath of a disastrous G-7 summit in Quebec in June, Trump called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest.\" The two countries are economically interdependent, with Canada being the primary destination for U.S. exports, and the U.S. market accounting for 75 percent of what Canada sells abroad.",
    " Title: North Dakota Delegates Select Cruz as Majority Preferred Candidate, but Loyalty Remains Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested race, Texas Senator Ted Cruz claimed a majority of delegates in North Dakota on Sunday, though the delegates' loyalty remains uncertain as they are not bound to him. The North Dakota Republicans selected 25 national delegates, with 18 of those being on a list of preferred delegates that Cruz circulated, marking a clear win for the senator.\n\nThe delegates met Sunday evening, just as the convention ended, and selected State Party Chairman Kelly Armstrong to be chair their convention delegation. Republican National Committeeman Curly Haugland and RNC Committeewoman Sandy Boehler were also chosen to serve on the powerful convention rules committee.\n\nParty leaders make up many of the slots, including Governor Jack Dalrymime, First Lady Betsy Dalrymple, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, and top party donors. However, party activists won a good number of slots as well.\n\nDelegates who said they were supporting Cruz Sunday were adamant in their support. Rick Becker, who ran a close race for the Republican nomination for governor at the convention, said he did not want to hold out making a decision in order to be wooed by candidates.\n\n\"Should I play that game? No, I do not care. If I was actually undecided, I'd say that, but I just kind of, I'm always standing by principle, as boring as that might be. I know I'm going to support Cruz, I can't fathom what would occur,\" Becker said. \"Holding out for a helicopter ride, or the goodie bags, or all that kind of crap. I'm just, I'm not interested in that.\"\n\nWith the delegates formally unbound and free to make their own decisions at the national convention, it would be impossible to declare North Dakota's results a clear win for any of the three campaigns. However, the race was on Sunday evening to do just that anyway. The Cruz campaign sought to portray the results as an unequivocal win.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to have the vote of confidence of Republican voters in North Dakota who delivered such a resounding victory today,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"As I met them over the weekend, North Dakota Republicans recognized that I am the only candidate who can move this country forward by protecting freedom and liberty.\"\n\nEven though none of the 17 national delegates contacted by CNN said they were voting for Kasich, the Ohio governor's campaign claimed a victory of sorts Sunday evening.\n\n\"Cruz strong arm tactics fail in ND, where he lost key floor vote & helped elect delegates who will vote @johnkasich in Cleveland. #NDGOP16\" tweeted top Kasich strategist John Weaver.\n\nCruz himself addressed the North Dakota Republican gathering Saturday. The other campaigns sent surrogates. Former candidate Ben Carson rallied the more than 1,600 state delegates for Trump Sunday morning, with a speech focused heavily on faith and his efforts to teach Trump religion and spirituality. But behind the scenes, he lobbied North Dakota Republican brass one-on-one.\n\nAhead of Sunday's speech, he pulled Haugland into a private meeting, and he also met privately with former Governor Ed Schafer the night before.\n\nAs the delegates packed into this Fargo hockey arena for the final day of their state convention, the Trump, Cruz, and Kasich campaigns worked furiously to identify supporters. Republicans were scheduled to vote for 25 national delegates from a list of 74 nominated delegates.\n\nBut the state's unique delegate selection process, which lets delegates vote for whichever candidate they prefer at the national convention, led to much battling between the campaigns.\n\nNorth Dakota's lone congressman, Rep. Kevin Cramer, endorsed Trump Sunday, shortly before North Dakota Republicans began selecting the delegates to the national convention.\n\n\"It's something I've been processing for a long time and it really culminated with my online straw poll where I really did want to give voice to the people who can't be here,\" Cramer said.\n\nBecause the delegates will be unbound, they are not formally committed to any campaign. However, that did not stop the campaigns from working to set expectations so they could claim victory.\n\nTrump adviser Barry Bennett told CNN that \"a plurality\" on the list of 25 preferred were leaning toward Trump after a strong lobbying effort from Cramer, who Bennett called the Trump operation's \"Sherpa\" over the course of the hectic weekend.\n\n\"We'll be drinking champagne here all day,\" Bennett said, if the slate of 25 delegates picked by party leaders earlier this weekend passes in the convention. Of the 25 people the party leaders put forward, 16 were chosen, and nine new delegates were selected.\n\nStill, as is the case on the ground in states around the country, Cruz's campaign has had a strong presence in and around the convention. In addition to Cruz's speech on Saturday, Carly Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and top Cruz surrogate, has been meeting publicly and privately with potential delegates since Friday.\n\nAs many as 10 of the delegates on the preferred list have indicated some or solid public support for Cruz. Kasich's delegate wranglers were equally optimistic Saturday after reviewing the list of party picks, saying they saw at least 20 on their who could be swayed to their side.\n\nIn the end, however, the decisions will not be known until the delegates place their vote on the first ballot at the national convention in Cleveland.",
    " Title: Sequestration Cuts Affect Military Personnel and Veterans, Sparking Concerns Over Program Cuts and Impact on Housing and Employment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe $85 billion in sequestration cuts, which took effect at the beginning of March, will not spare soldiers, veterans, or their families, with a wave of cuts being announced for tuition assistance and programs that help homeless veterans get back on their feet. The Pentagon, for months, warned that the sequester cuts would be catastrophic. However, the Defense Department is not the only federal agency with programs for servicemen and women that are vulnerable.\n\nUnder a federal housing program that helps roughly 100,000 Americans, homeless and formerly homeless veterans will lose assistance due to the sequester. The program, run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides state grants to help veterans get housing. A HUD spokesman told FoxNews.com that local officials will determine which projects will not be renewed under the program, and that the agency also is concerned about the impact of the cuts on the elderly and children.\n\nActive-duty military personnel will also feel the impact of sequestration. The Army announced Friday that it will no longer accept applications for its Tuition Assistance program, which gives soldiers as much as $4,500 annually to take courses at accredited schools toward high school and college diplomas. Army officials could not give a specific amount on how much the cuts would save, but said 201,000 soldiers used the program in fiscal 2012 at the cost of $373 million. In addition, the Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard announced this week that their programs also have been suspended.\n\nPete Hegseth, chief executive of Concerned Veterans for America, told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that Washington indeed needs to examine its spending and cut the waste. However, he said, officials have gone after \"low hanging fruit\" such as military tuition assistance because special interest groups have protected big items like weapons systems.\n\n\"Our government has made a contract with veterans,\" Hegseth said. \"So we have a responsibility to them, above most everyone else. But I would say we need to consider reform.\"\n\nCongress allowed the drastic, across-the-board cuts in 2011 after failing to reach a deal on a more measured approach to fixing Washington's fiscal problems. The cuts kicked in March 1, with Democrats and Republicans acknowledging they could hurt the U.S. economy and trying to find alternative ways to make the reductions, which will equal roughly $1.2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is spared from the cuts. However, cuts elsewhere in the federal budget will nevertheless affect veterans. Even a joint effort between HUD and the VA to provide housing vouchers for veterans -- while technically spared -- might be affected because HUD fears local-level housing agencies might not accept the vouchers because of federal cuts to funding that helps them administer the program.\n\nFurther, a Labor Department program that provides employment-related assistance for veterans also is being cut. An agency spokesman said Monday that tens of thousands of veterans under the VETS job-training program will no longer receive assistance. He said reaching a more exact number is difficult because the cuts were made in overlapping budgets and the full impact will really be felt over the next couple of months. However, he confirmed that 33,000 fewer veterans will be served under a state grant program known as Jobs for Veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans have complained about the federal government's spending amid the cuts to veterans and others -- including $250 million in aid to Egypt and an essentially untouchable, $400 billion program to build F-35 fighter jets before testing is complete.\n\nA spokesman for Republican Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the California congressman has warned of such consequences for the past 18 months and continues to try to upend the sequester.\n\n\"No one has rung the alarm bell more than Chairman McKeon,\" said spokesman Claude Chafin. He also said McKeon's objective now is to use House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan's new budget to end sequester.\n\n\"Not delay, not reverse, but stop,\" Chafin said.",
    " Title: \"The Globalist's Trifecta: A Critical Examination of Free Trade, Deregulation, and Immigration Policies in America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the small town of Holden, Maine, Jonette Christian, head of Mainers for a Sensible Immigration Policy, has raised concerns about the impact of free trade, deregulation, and immigration policies on the American economy and society. In a thought-provoking piece, Christian argues that these policies, often referred to as the \"globalist's trifecta,\" were not initiated by the American people but rather imposed upon them.\n\nChristian contends that Americans did not ask for free trade agreements that led to the erosion of American manufacturing, the outsourcing of jobs, and the transformation of the nation from a maker to a consumer-based society. Similarly, the deregulation of banking, which precipitated the 2008 financial crisis, was not a grassroots movement.\n\nMoreover, the quadrupling of immigration since 1986, as per the Migration Policy Institute, was not a demand from the American people. Christian questions whether the American people ever asked Congress to increase immigration, stating that such a request would be unlikely.\n\nChristian argues that the globalist's trifecta, sold as a means to stimulate economic growth, has resulted in winners and losers. While bankers and investors have grown rich, wages for working Americans have stagnated, good jobs have vanished, the middle class has shrunk, and infrastructure is crumbling under the weight of a burgeoning population.\n\nThe globalist's trifecta, according to Christian, is shaping political debates in Maine, with employers arguing that the state needs immigrants to stimulate economic growth. This argument is reinforced by data from organizations like the Partnership for a New American Economy, which is a coalition of billionaires, corporate CEOs, and their political allies.\n\nChristian criticizes the Partnership for its one-sided approach, presenting data without links and industry-funded \"studies\" that do not consider costs or labor impacts. She accuses Maine editorial writers of blindly accepting the Partnership's data and \"studies\" without questioning their validity.\n\nIn conclusion, Christian calls for Americans to think for themselves, suggesting that employers offering livable wages is a more sustainable solution to attract and retain workers, rather than relying on an endless influx of immigrants. She urges Americans to question the globalist's trifecta and its impact on their lives and the nation's future.",
    " Title: Tightening Presidential Race: Obama's Lead in Swing States Narrows as Romney Gains Ground\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest CBS News/New York Times/Quinnipiac University polls from three crucial swing states indicate a narrowing gap between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. The poll shows President Obama's lead in Florida shrinking to three points, down from a six-point advantage in July. In Ohio, Obama still leads Romney by six points, while in Wisconsin, home state of Romney's running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, the two candidates are in a virtual tie, with just two points separating them.\n\nThe tightening race in these battleground states suggests that Romney is closing the gap with the incumbent. Furthermore, the poll numbers may underestimate Romney's performance due to flawed samples, according to some analysts. Ed Morrissey, a political commentator, points out that the partisan splits in the samples are skewed.\n\nIn Florida, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 4.5 percentage points, while the mean Florida electorate from 2008 and 2010 was only Democratic-leaning by 1.5 percentage points. In Ohio, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 4.5 percentage points, while the mean '08/'10 hybrid Buckeye State electorate was Democratic-leaning by 3.5 percentage points. In Wisconsin, the poll sample is Democratic-leaning by 2 percentage points, while the state's combined electorate was only Democratic-leaning by 2.5 percentage points.\n\nAnother significant finding from the poll's internals is the under-sampling of 2008 McCain voters in Florida and Ohio. The new poll's Florida respondents voted for Obama over McCain by a nine-point margin, while the actual election result was Obama by three points. The poll's Ohio respondents backed Obama by 13 points, while the actual election result was Obama by four-and-a-half points.\n\nA new USA Today/Gallup poll shows a record number of Americans identifying as independents, with Romney holding a \"clear edge\" on the economy and a larger lead on deficits. Obama leads on several other issues, but more voters say Obama is attacking Romney unfairly than vice versa. The GOP has an enthusiasm advantage, and the generic Congressional ballot is tied. Romney leads men by eight points, while Obama leads women by the same margin.\n\nWith eleven weeks remaining until the election, Romney would rather be leading across the board, but the tightening race in these crucial swing states suggests a competitive and closely contested election.",
    " Title: Congress Returns to Work Amidst Election-Year Politics and a Limited Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Congress reconvenes on Monday, election-year politics are expected to shape an already limited agenda. The Republican party has vowed to scrutinize President Barack Obama's health care law, capitalizing on its problematic rollout as they aim to maintain their House majority and potentially seize control of the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nIn the House, the focus will be on legislation addressing the security of personal data, a move that forms part of the Republican's broader effort to protect citizens from the perceived negative effects of Obamacare. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., has emphasized the need for individuals to be informed promptly if their personal information is breached.\n\nIn addition to data security, the Republicans have pledged to scrutinize the administration's enrollment numbers in the health care program. Meanwhile, Democrats will push for a federal minimum wage increase and the extension of unemployment benefits, attempting to portray their party as more concerned with the less fortunate and committed to addressing income inequality.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, has emphasized the urgency of restoring federal benefits for an estimated 1.3 million Americans who lost their benefits on Dec. 28. He underscores the human impact of the issue, stating, \"It's about real people, people with families struggling to put food on the table, to make ends meet, including... 200,000 military veterans who are among these folks who are losing their benefits.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has scheduled a vote Monday night on legislation to extend jobless benefits for three months. The Senate will also vote on President Obama's nomination of Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve, with Yellen set to become the first woman to fill the powerful post if confirmed.\n\nCongress faces several significant unfinished business items, including agreeing on a spending bill to keep the government running and avoid a potential shutdown, and reaching a compromise on the farm bill, which was a point of contention last year. The Senate will also likely address a new Iran sanctions bill, with 26 senators already signed on, despite President Obama's opposition.\n\nAnother issue that may not be an immediate legislative priority is immigration reform, although advocates remain hopeful. The top echelon of the military, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other Senate Democrats and Republicans oppose a bill by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., that would give victims of rape and sexual assault in the military an independent route for prosecuting attackers.\n\nThe House's approach to major legislation, such as immigration reform and overhauling the budget, remains uncertain, with some Republicans resisting any legislation due to concerns about a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.",
    " Title: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Other Major Banks Targeted in Coordinated Cyber Attack by Russian Hackers\n\nA coordinated cyber attack on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and at least four other banks this month has resulted in the loss of gigabytes of customer data, according to two people familiar with the investigation. The FBI is currently investigating whether the attack could be in retaliation for U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe attack led to the theft of account information that could be used to drain funds, as well as the theft of sensitive information from employee computers. The incidents occurred at a low point in relations between the U.S. and Russia, with Russian troops continuing to mass on the Ukrainian border despite U.S. and European sanctions.\n\nInvestigators have determined that the attacks were routed through computers in Latin America and other regions via servers used by Russian hackers. The hackers took advantage of a type of software flaw known as a zero-day in at least one of the bank's websites. The sophistication of the attack and technical indicators extracted from the banks' computers provide some evidence of a government link, though the trail is murky enough that cyber criminals from Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe could be behind the assaults.\n\nJPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said it took additional steps to safeguard sensitive and confidential information. The company will contact any customers that might have been affected, though it hasn't seen unusual levels of fraud. The absence of fraud would lend support to the theory that the hack had a political motive.\n\nU.S. and European sanctions have altered the way banks are interacting with Russian entities, triggering the ire of Russian officials. In April, JPMorgan was singled out for criticism when it blocked a payment from a Russian embassy to the affiliate of a U.S.-sanctioned bank. Russia's foreign ministry called the move by New York-based JPMorgan \"illegal and absurd.\"\n\nThe U.S. government and European authorities are currently examining the possibility that the uptick in attacks is related to the conflict over Russia's behavior in Ukraine. It couldn't be determined whether this month's data thefts resulted in any financial losses for consumers. The people familiar with the hacks didn't specify whether the stolen information included credit-card numbers or other easily sold financial data.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has warned shareholders in annual letters that hackers' efforts to breach the bank's computers were growing more frequent, sophisticated, and dangerous. The bank expects to boost annual spending on cybersecurity by 25 percent to about $250 million by the end of the year from 2013 levels.\n\nBanks must disclose when customer data is breached, a process that can take days or weeks. Companies often don't immediately know what information was taken or who was affected. If a theft leads to losses, consumers have more protections than corporations. The full extent of the damage caused by the recent attacks remains unknown.",
    " Title: Obama Nominates Three Judges to Fill Vacancies on D.C. Circuit Court, Accusing Republicans of Political Obstruction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to address the long-standing vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, President Obama announced the nomination of three top lawyers on Tuesday. The president, in a Rose Garden address, accused Senate Republicans of political obstruction for blocking his judicial nominees, claiming that their motives are not principled but rather political.\n\nThe president's remarks come amidst political pressure from both sides on the issue of vacant federal court seats, particularly those in the D.C. Circuit. Democrats have urged Obama to move more aggressively with nominations, while Republicans argue that the D.C. Circuit doesn't need more judges and are promoting a plan to shift seats to other circuits.\n\nPresident Obama blamed Senate Republicans for blocking his judicial nominees, calling their motives political, and noting that when they do reach the floor of the Senate, they are confirmed with bipartisan support. \"So this is not about principled opposition; this is about political obstruction,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president claimed that his judicial nominees have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of his Republican predecessor, and made that point twice for emphasis. Obama also acknowledged that Democrats, too, held up judicial nominations when he was in the Senate.\n\n\"But what's happening now is unprecedented,\" Obama said. \"For the good of the American people, it has to stop. Too much of the people's business is at stake. Our legal framework depends on timely confirmations of judicial nominees.\"\n\nFederal court nominations, which are made for life, represent an important part of a president's legacy. By moving three names at once, the president is signaling that he's ready to use political capital on the matter. Critics of the president accused him of moving now to create a distraction from the troubles plaguing various federal agencies and departments, including the Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department.\n\nThe president nominated a diverse trio of respected legal figures to the D.C. Circuit:\n\n1. Patricia Ann Millett, who runs the Supreme Court practice at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C., and has argued 32 cases before the US Supreme Court \u2013 until recently, Obama said, a record for a female lawyer. She also served nine years, during both Democratic and Republican administrations, as an assistant to the solicitor general at the Justice Department.\n\n2. Cornelia \u201cNina\u201d T.L. Pillard, a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington. She has served twice in the Justice Department and was an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Obama cited as \u201clandmark successes\u201d her defense before the Supreme Court of the Family and Medical Leave Act and the opening of the Virginia Military Institute to female students.\n\n3. Robert Leon Wilkins, who is African-American, is a judge on the federal D.C. District Court, confirmed without opposition in 2010. Before that, Judge Wilkins spent eight years in private practice, and a decade as a public defender in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne aspect of his nominees that shows no diversity is their common legal alma mater. Like Obama, they are all graduates of Harvard Law School.\n\nLast month, Obama won the first confirmation of a judge to the D.C. Circuit of his presidency, when Sri Srinivasan was approved 97 to 0 by the Senate. In his remarks Tuesday, Obama pointed to \u201cmounting public pressure\u201d and \u201cvocal bipartisan support\u201d as helping Judge Srinivasan win confirmation. But he also noted the experience of another D.C. Circuit nominee, Caitlin Halligan, who faced multiple filibusters over 2-1/2 years and eventually withdrew in March.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit holds a special place in the pantheon of federal appellate courts, as it hears cases of national and international significance. The court considers the constitutionality of federal regulations and the actions of federal agencies, and is often the last word in cases, since most do not reach the US Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit is also a steppingstone to the high court.\n\nHowever, Sen. Charles Grassley (R) of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants to shrink the D.C. Circuit, saying its caseload does not justify 11 seats. He has introduced legislation that would shift two of the court's seats to other circuits and eliminate one seat altogether.\n\nObama laughed with exasperation at the claim that he is trying to \"pack the court.\" \"We're not adding seats here,\" he said. \"We're trying to fill seats that are already existing.\"\n\nWith the addition of Srinivasan, the D.C. Circuit now has four Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees, but among the court's six \"senior judges\" \u2013 formerly full-time judges who still hear cases \u2013 five are Republican appointees. So for both parties, the current vacancies have clear political import.\n\nSenate majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada has suggested he may move this summer to change the rules on filibusters \u2013 from a requirement of 60 votes to end debate to a simple majority \u2013 on judicial and executive branch nominations. Such a move, known as the \"nuclear option,\" would add an explosive new level of partisan angst to the Washington scene.",
    " Title: Equifax to Pay Up to $700 Million in Settlement Over 2017 Data Breach\n\nIn a significant development, credit reporting agency Equifax has agreed to pay up to $700 million to settle claims arising from a 2017 data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 150 million people. The settlement, which involves the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, will provide up to $425 million in monetary relief to consumers, a $100 million civil money penalty, and other relief.\n\nThe breach, one of the largest ever to threaten private information, occurred when Equifax, based in Atlanta, failed to detect the attack for more than six weeks. The compromised data included Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver license numbers, credit card numbers, and in some cases, data from passports.\n\nAffected consumers may be eligible to receive monetary compensation by filing one or more claims for conditions such as money spent on credit monitoring or identity theft protection after the breach and the cost of freezing or unfreezing credit reports at any consumer reporting agency. All impacted consumers will be eligible to receive at least 10 years of free credit-monitoring, at least seven years of free identity-restoration services, and, starting on Dec. 31 and extending seven years, all U.S. consumers may request up to six free copies of their Equifax credit report during any 12-month period.\n\nIf consumers choose not to enroll in the free credit monitoring product available through the settlement, they may seek up to $125 as a reimbursement for the cost of a credit-monitoring product of their choice. Consumers must submit a claim to receive free credit monitoring or cash reimbursements.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons commented, \"Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data.\" He added, \"Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers. This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud.\"\n\nThe settlement, which was confirmed on Monday, follows a report by The Wall Street Journal that Equifax had reached a deal with the U.S. The company had earlier this year set aside around $700 million to cover anticipated settlements and fines. The settlement must still be approved by the federal district court in the Northern District of Georgia. Shares of Equifax Inc. dipped slightly before the opening bell.",
    " Title: U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice Makes Case for Military Action in Syria, Citing Security Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the New America Foundation on Monday, National Security Adviser Susan Rice made a compelling argument for military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, citing the use of chemical weapons against civilians and the potential impact on American security.\n\nRice emphasized that the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons must be met with accountability, and that ignoring such an \"audacious attack\" could have far-reaching consequences, emboldening those who might use weapons of mass destruction. She stated, \"We cannot allow terrorists bent on destruction, or a nuclear North Korea, or an aspiring nuclear Iran, to believe for one minute that we are shying away from our determination to back up our longstanding warnings.\"\n\nRice's comments were part of the administration's last-ditch effort to garner support for military action in Syria. Later on Monday, President Obama is set to give interviews to six major news outlets, each focused on Syria. On Tuesday night, Mr. Obama will address the nation from the White House.\n\nBehind the scenes, administration officials are actively lobbying lawmakers to support House and Senate resolutions authorizing \"limited\" action against the Assad government. However, the administration is facing growing opposition on Capitol Hill, with several senators stating they will oppose a military force resolution. Some, like Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, have urged the administration to pursue a diplomatic solution, while others, such as Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, have expressed concerns about the potential escalation of U.S. involvement, leading to ground forces and, ultimately, American casualties.\n\nRice attempted to address these concerns, stating that the U.S. will not intervene in sectarian struggles or impose its will on the democratic development of other nations. However, she emphasized that the U.S. will stand up for certain principles, particularly the prohibition of chemical weapons use. Rice stated, \"No government should ever be permitted to use chemical weapons and get away with it.\"\n\nWith the United Nations unable and unwilling to address the Syrian crisis, the U.S. is attempting to build its own coalition, which currently includes France and several other nations. However, the administration is facing challenges in finding willing partners and building a broad coalition for military action.",
    " Title: American Corporations in a Globalized Economy: A Shift in Allegiance?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt mobilized American industry to support the war effort, with companies such as Ford, General Motors, and Boeing playing significant roles. However, in the current globalized economy, there are questions about whether American corporations would prioritize their country's interests in the same way.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation posed this question to 19 of the largest U.S. corporations, but received evasive or no responses from 10 of them, including Amazon, Apple, Chevron, and General Electric. The remaining companies offered ambiguous answers, with only General Motors and JPMorgan Chase identifying as American institutions.\n\nRecent events have raised concerns about the loyalty of some U.S.-based corporations. Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel accused Google of \"seemingly treasonous\" behavior for its alleged collaboration with the Chinese government on Project Dragonfly, a censored search engine designed to restrict information flow within China. At the same time, Google refused to work with the U.S. military.\n\nGoogle, like many other U.S. corporations, has a global presence, with operations, sales, and customers in various parts of the world. These companies often prioritize their bottom line over national allegiances, viewing a dollar made in China as equivalent to a dollar made in America.\n\nThe question is whether this global focus is sustainable for the United States. With Washington increasingly influenced by corporate America, there is a growing concern that corporate interests are no longer aligned with those of the American people.\n\nCorporate America wields significant influence in Washington, with lobbyists and think tanks funded by these companies shaping government policy and regulation. Former congresspersons often transition into high-paying corporate lobbying roles, creating a revolving door between Capitol Hill and the corporate world.\n\nThe increasing corporate influence in Washington has led to a crisis of representation for the American people. As the lines between corporate and national interests blur, it is essential for American corporations to reevaluate their priorities and ensure they are acting in the best interests of their home country.",
    " Title: Project Veritas' Allegations of CBS News Staging COVID-19 Coverage at Grand Rapids Medical Center Met with Denials from Both Parties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, right-wing activist group Project Veritas published an article on May 6, claiming that a CBS News crew orchestrated a staged COVID-19 testing line at the Cherry Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The allegation quickly gained traction on Twitter and was picked up by various media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, The Daily Beast, and entertainment news website Deadline.\n\nProject Veritas founder James O' Keefe, in a video accompanying the article, stated that an insider from the Grand Rapids medical center claimed CBS News created a fake COVID-19 testing line, diverting doctors and medical personnel away from treating patients to stage the event for CBS News and their national morning show.\n\nHowever, CBS News issued a statement denying any involvement in orchestrating the line, placing the blame on Cherry Health. The statement, included in the original article, was framed as a \"BREAKING\" update by O' Keefe, who claimed the statement came in response to the article. However, the statement was delivered to Project Veritas on May 5, a day before publication.\n\nThe insider's identity and role at the facility were not revealed by Project Veritas, but in his interview with O' Keefe, the insider revealed that he grew suspicious after witnessing the alleged staging, but had no direct knowledge of who was responsible. Only one person in the hidden footage mentions CBS, saying \"apparently the news crew wanted more people in the line.\" The basis for this claim is never explored, and other employees of Cherry Health were caught on camera putting the blame not on CBS but on Cherry Health's director of quality and information.\n\nA representative from CBS reiterated the statement provided to Project Veritas when contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check. In a statement provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check by a representative of Cherry Health Medical Center via email, Cherry Health CEO Tasha Blackman concurred that, to her knowledge, \"CBS This Morning did not stage any part of their visit to our site.\" Blackman also denied that she had instructed staff to get into the line, but when asked if that was true of other members of Cherry Health's leadership team as well, Blackman stated:\n\n\"I was not aware of any staging that took place. Cherry Health has had a process of pre-screening individuals for COVID-19 testing. On the day of the CBS interview we had 34 prescreened individuals that came for testing. I was not asked for help on any staging, nor was I aware that any staging activities were going on. The only requests we had were tied to the number of patients being tested that day and the PPE supply that we had in place.\"\n\nIt appears that some staging took place at Cherry Health during filming for the CBS news segment, but given the statements by the parties involved and O' Keefe's history of misleadingly editing videos, Project Veritas' presentation of events deserves a healthy dose of skepticism.",
    " Title: Controversy Surrounds Federal Immigration Policy as Deportation Halt Granted to Some Illegals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, federal immigration authorities have begun granting temporary legal status to some illegal immigrants under President Obama's deportation halt. According to Rep. Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, this includes cases where the illegal immigrants have been in the U.S. for less than five years, a criteria set by the administration.\n\nRep. Smith, a Texas Republican, obtained documents showing that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) officers are actively seeking out illegal immigrants who may be eligible for their cases to be dropped. These illegal immigrants are then granted tentative status.\n\n\"President Obama is granting amnesty to illegal immigrants behind Americans' backs,\" Mr. Smith said. He claimed that the administration's plan, which was supposed to take 60 days to implement, has already been benefiting some illegal immigrants, despite there being no standards in place.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not return a call seeking comment. However, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen stated that the policy was always intended to apply immediately to illegal immigrants already in the deportation system.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that will judge most of these cases, is yet to put in place a more formal process. This process is expected to be implemented on August 15.\n\nLast month, President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet A. Napolitano announced they would unilaterally halt deportations for illegal immigrants who would have qualified for the Dream Act. To avoid deportation under the new rules, illegal immigrants would have to meet certain criteria, including being brought to the U.S. by age 16, graduating high school or earning an equivalency degree, not being convicted of major crimes, and having been in the U.S. for at least five years.\n\nThose granted a stay of deportation are given permission to work in the U.S., which could lead to hundreds of thousands of new, legal workers entering the economy.\n\nThe program has come under fire from both sides. Some immigrant-rights activists have expressed concerns about the program's lack of assurances, while critics argue that it is too broad and may lead to fraud.\n\nMs. Christensen, the ICE spokeswoman, stated that the agency has broad authority to halt deportations on a case-by-case basis, even when illegal immigrants fall short of the new standards, especially in \"humanitarian\" cases involving individuals brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nAs for documents, Ms. Christensen said ICE officers are already trained in what documents to ask for and how to evaluate them as part of their jobs. Acceptable documents they can request include passports, visas, school or medical records, and leases.\n\nPart of President Obama's dilemma on immigration is that the U.S. has the resources to deport about 400,000 illegal immigrants a year, which means it has to live up to that level. The president has tried to focus deportation efforts on illegal immigrants with criminal records, but the latest statistics showed a backsliding this year.\n\nIn fiscal year 2012, which began on October 1, about 49 percent of all illegal immigrants deported did not have criminal records. This is up from about 44 percent last year, and the change has immigrant-rights advocates furious.\n\nICE said it is trying to focus its priorities, and stated that even though criminal deportations are down slightly, most of the non-criminals are still important targets for deportation. Of the more than 143,000 non-criminal illegal immigrants removed from October 1 to June 23, nearly half had repeatedly violated immigration rules, and more than 49,000 others were recent entrants who were removed at the border.\n\nA little fewer than 5,000 illegal immigrants, or less than 2 percent of the total, were rank-and-file illegal immigrants who didn't fall into any of the administration's target categories.",

The warning stems from the discovery of methanol, or wood alcohol, in these products, which can be harmful when ingested or absorbed through the skin.\n\nThe FDA advises that methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers due to its toxic effects. The agency's letter cautions consumers not to buy hand sanitizer products from Eskbiochem, following FDA testing that revealed high methanol concentrations in two of their hand sanitizer products, Lavar Gel and CleanCare No Germ.\n\nLavar Gel contains over 80% methanol and no ethyl alcohol, the main FDA-approved ingredient for hand sanitizers. CleanCare No Germ contains nearly 30% methanol, according to the FDA's findings. As of June 23, the FDA reports no cases of harmful health effects associated with the Eskbiochem hand sanitizers, but urges caution nonetheless.\n\nIf you have used a hand sanitizer with methanol in the last few months, the FDA advises disposing of it immediately. They also urge seeking medical treatment promptly if you've been exposed to methanol, as intervention is necessary to reverse the toxic effects of methanol poisoning.\n\nThe demand for hand sanitizers remains high amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the recent health warning serves as a reminder for consumers to be vigilant when purchasing new brands, especially those that may not have previously manufactured hand sanitizer. The FDA emphasizes that young children are especially susceptible to the risks associated with methanol.\n\nIt is essential to note that the information provided in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as health or medical advice.

    " Title: U.S. Markets Plunge in Historic Drop Amid Coronavirus Fears, Dow Jones Industrial Average Enters Bear Market\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, U.S. stocks plummeted once again on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 2,352.60 points lower, or 9.99%, at 21,200.62. This marked the worst drop since the 1987 \"Black Monday\" market crash, when the index collapsed by more than 22%. The S&P 500 also experienced a significant decline, dropping 9.5% to 2,480.64, joining the Dow in a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite closed 9.4% lower at 7,200.10.\n\nThe major averages saw a brief respite during the trading day following the Federal Reserve's announcement of increased overnight funding operations and the expansion of securities it would purchase with reserves. However, stocks quickly traded back towards their session lows as investors awaited more aggressive measures to support the economy and target the virus outbreak directly.\n\nThursday's sell-off was so severe that trading was halted briefly after the open for 15 minutes as markets hit the mandated \"circuit-breaker\" threshold used by U.S. exchanges. The Dow went on to notch its fifth-worst decline in its history, according to FactSet. Even the worst one-day drop of the 2008 financial crisis did not reach this magnitude.\n\nNot much was immune to the financial market plunge. Small-cap benchmark the Russell 2000 index cratered by 11%. Gold fell, oil plunged, credit market spreads widened significantly, and even U.S. Treasurys, a reliable safe haven earlier in the sell-off, ended Thursday lower.\n\n\"We are going into a global recession,\" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"After what's been happening the last few days, we are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops.\"\n\nIn his address, President Trump announced travel from Europe will be suspended for 30 days as part of the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. Trump also said the administration would provide financial relief for workers who are ill, caring for others due to the virus, or are quarantined.\n\nHowever, these measures were not enough for investors, who were looking for a more targeted fiscal response to address the issue of slower economic growth stemming from the coronavirus. \"President Trump in an extraordinary Oval Office address did not offer up major new ideas on stimulus and only said he'd propose a vague payroll tax holiday to Congress without strongly standing up for any firm size/magnitude,\" wrote Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist for Evercore ISI, in a note. \"This effectively kicks the issue to Congress.\"\n\nCruise line shares dropped sharply. Royal Caribbean closed 31.8% lower while Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line slid 15% and 20.7%, respectively. Airline shares such as United, Delta, and American all fell more than 21%.\n\nThe S&P 500 officially closed in a bear market on Thursday, down more than 26% from its record high set just last month. The Dow ended its historic 11-year bull market run a day earlier on Wednesday. A bear market marks a 20% decline from all-time highs. The trading halt did not stop the major averages from falling even further. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best fear gauge on Wall Street, jumped to more than 76 and hit its highest level since 2008.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday that the National Basketball Association is suspending its season after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for coronavirus and the news that movie actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, also tested positive for the coronavirus, have caused further concern about how pervasive the virus could already be in this country.\n\n\"The crux of the angst investors are feeling as the coronavirus spreads surrounds what might happen to consumer spending,\" wrote Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \"Consumers sitting at home and not out spending money because they fear catching the coronavirus is the ultimate negative outcome.\" He added, \"It has been the U.S. consumer who has been driving the recovery bus during this long expansion.\"\n\nThursday's plunge came after yet another wild session on Wall Street and the demise of the Dow's record-setting bull market run that began in March 2009. The blue-chip index tumbled 1,464.94 points, or 5.9%, to close at 23,553.22. The 30-stock average closed in a bear market, putting an end to an expansion that started in 2009 amid the financial crisis. The Dow also plummeted more than 2,000 points on Monday.",
    " Title: Lawrence Summers Withdraws from Consideration for Federal Reserve Chair, Paving Way for Potential Historic Nomination of Janet Yellen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Lawrence Summers, the leading contender to succeed current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, has withdrawn his name from consideration, the White House announced Sunday.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in a statement, confirmed the withdrawal, expressing gratitude for Summers' contributions during the economic crisis. \"Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,\" Obama said.\n\nAs director of the National Economic Council, Summers oversaw the administration's response to the economic and financial crisis early in Obama's first term. However, Summers faced opposition from some Democrats, including members of the Senate Banking Committee. In a letter to Obama, Summers cited the potential for an acrimonious confirmation process as the reason for his withdrawal.\n\nSummers' ascent to the top of the list to succeed Bernanke rankled some of the president's liberal supporters. Criticisms ranged from perceptions of being too cozy with Wall Street to controversial comments about women and math and science.\n\nThe withdrawal of Summers could pave the way for Janet Yellen, another candidate on Obama's shortlist, to take over Bernanke's position. Yellen, who became a member of the Fed's board of governors in 1994, would be the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.\n\nObama is expected to announce his nomination as early as this month. Bernanke's term ends on January 31, 2014. The president's decision could potentially ease tensions with his liberal base, which has been critical of his handling of issues such as the National Security Agency's spying programs and his call for a military strike against Syria.\n\nShaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women's rights group UltraViolet, welcomed Summers' withdrawal, stating, \"I hope it serves as a reminder to all that sexism has no place anywhere in society and certainly not in the highest levels of our government.\" Thomas called on Obama to nominate Yellen for the position.\n\nObama has defended Summers in recent weeks, both in public comments and in closed-door meetings with lawmakers. \"I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future,\" Obama said Sunday.",
    " Title: North Korea Barricades South Korean Workers from Joint Industrial Park, Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has barred South Korean workers from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a jointly run factory park on the border, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two Koreas. The move comes a day after Pyongyang announced plans to restart its plutonium reactor and a uranium enrichment plant, potentially increasing the production of nuclear materials for its developing nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Kaesong Industrial Complex, established in 2004, has been a unique symbol of cooperation between the two Koreas amidst their otherwise hostile relationship. The continued operation of the park during periods of high tension has served as a reassurance to foreign multinationals that another Korean War is unlikely and their investments in South Korea are secure.\n\nThe latest disruption at the park, which provides jobs for over 50,000 North Koreans, is unclear in duration. In 2009, a similar disruption during tensions over U.S.-South Korean military drills lasted only three days.\n\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Hyung-suk, confirmed that Pyongyang is allowing South Koreans to return home from Kaesong. However, about 480 South Koreans who had planned to travel to the park on Wednesday were refused entry.\n\nTrucks carrying South Korean goods streamed back into South Korea through the Paju border checkpoint in the morning, minutes after heading north. The North Korean government has expressed anger over South Korean media reports suggesting that the park remains open due to its importance as a source of hard currency for the impoverished nation.\n\nThe industrial park generates approximately $470 million in goods annually, primarily for export to other countries. For North Korea, the wages for its workers totaled some $81 million last year, highlighting the risks of its brinkmanship leading to a dangerous polarization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nExperts view the North's actions as a \"slap in the face\" following South Korea's recent extension of medical aid to the North. Lee Choon-kun, a North Korea researcher at the Korea Economic Research Institute, stated, \"I see this as a start for more provocative actions.\"\n\nThe Kaesong Industrial Complex, initially conceived as a test case for reunification and reconciliation, serves as a stark reminder of the material prosperity that the North lacks but the South possesses. The enormous gap between the two Koreas, which emerged in the decades following the Korean War, is evident in the industrial park, where South Korean-made cars and modern facilities contrast sharply with the drafty, under-resourced factories in the rest of the peninsula.\n\nInside the complex, North Korean workers work alongside South Korean managers, discussing orders and mapping out production. However, they tend not to socialize with one another, and meals are typically taken separately.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and both sides have expressed hope that the tension will not lead to a complete shutdown of the complex. The South Korean government has a contingency plan in place for its citizens in Kaesong, but the duration and impact of the latest disruption remain uncertain.",
    " Title: A Comparative Analysis of U.S. Spending on Social Programs, Defense, and Crime Control\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to its peer nations, the United States allocates a significantly different proportion of its annual output towards social programs, defense, and crime control. The U.S. dedicates 18.7% of its GDP to social programs, compared to 31.2% by France and 25.1% by Germany. The country spends just 0.6% of its GDP on family benefits, one-sixth of what Sweden spends and one-third the rich-country average.\n\nIn terms of healthcare, the U.S. spends more than its counterparts, yet its system is described as broken, patchy, and inequitable, leaving people without care and causing financial hardship for many who do receive it.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. spends twice as much on military expenditure as Europe, and more on domestic public-safety programs than most of its peer nations. The country incarcerates millions, with an incarceration rate far higher than other NATO countries. If Massachusetts, the state with the lowest incarceration rate, were its own country, it would imprison more people than all but nine other nations, including Turkmenistan.\n\nDespite these high spending levels, the U.S. does not appear to be safer than its peers. Violent crime rates have decreased in recent decades, but the country still has a higher murder rate than the average among OECD member countries and approximately four times the rate in Canada. The number of rapes, adjusted for population size, is four times higher than in Denmark. Robberies are more than twice as common as they are in Poland. Gun violence is prevalent, with child firearm deaths and injuries considered a major clinical and public health crisis. Additionally, Americans experience a disproportionate amount of violence at the hands of law enforcement.\n\nIn terms of social welfare, the U.S. spends roughly double on police, prisons, and courts compared to food stamps, welfare, and income supplements. At the federal level, the country spends twice as much on the Pentagon as on assistance programs and eight times as much on defense as on education. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are estimated to cost around $6 trillion, while policing costs $100 billion annually. Proposals to address issues such as homelessness, universal prekindergarten, reducing the racial wealth gap, and eliminating poverty among families with children are often not funded.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. spends $31,286 per year on each incarcerated person and $12,201 per year on every primary and secondary school student. This spending pattern, characterized by a thin social safety net, an expansive security state, and high levels of crime, raises questions about the effectiveness and priorities of the U.S. government's spending decisions.",
    " Title: \"Reassessing the Iraq War: A Reflection on the Possible Motives, Consequences, and Lessons Learned\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, questions have arisen regarding the true motivations behind the military action. A growing body of evidence suggests that the invasion may not have been primarily driven by the presence of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, but rather by other factors such as political and economic interests, and the desire to depose Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe possibility exists that the WMD Saddam Hussein once possessed were sold to him by American arms dealers with the approval of the U.S. government during the 1980s. If this is true, it would mean that he no longer had these weapons when the United States invaded in 2003. The principal reason for the invasion, according to some, was to depose Saddam due to his attempted assassination of President George H.W. Bush, whose son, President George W. Bush, ordered the invasion.\n\nAnother reason for the invasion could have been to enable Western-allied governments to control or receive oil from Iraq. The Bush administration has been accused of lying to the American people, Congress, the U.N., and governments of other nations in order to gain support for the invasion. It is also suggested that the Bush administration knew all along that Saddam posed no threat to the stability of the Middle East or the freedom or security of the U.S.\n\nSaddam, in fact, may have been a stabilizing force in the Middle East, as he kept a lid on the 1,000-year-old religious dispute between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam, and persecuted neither group excessively. However, he did use the WMD provided by American arms dealers to gas thousands of Kurds.\n\nThe invasion resulted in the deaths of 4,500 Americans and 650,000 Iraqis, and injuries to 40,000 Americans. It also displaced 2 million Iraqis and destroyed more than $100 billion in Iraqi property. The invasion degraded the Iraqi military, sent many members of the Iraqi military underground or into the arms of anti-government resistance fighters, and produced a fierce resistance and determined will to expel the American invaders.\n\nThe Middle East has been the scene of a 1,000-year-old religious dispute between the Sunni and Shia, and under Saddam, the Sunni persecuted the Shia and also persecuted a third group in that region, the Kurds. The Shia now persecute the Sunni. Iraq is not a country of people with common cultures and interests and generally accepted borders, but rather an amalgam of warring groups cobbled together by British and American diplomats. Only a strongman like Saddam \u2014 however evil and ill-suited for government by Western standards \u2014 can keep peace and stability in an artificial country like Iraq.\n\nAl Qaeda was not present in Iraq before America invaded, but the invasion drew Al Qaeda fighters to Iraq from Africa and other parts of the Middle East. The American invasion produced a violent stew of resistance to and resentment of American-induced violence in Iraq, which has been known by different names but is now called the Islamic State, or ISIS. This stew includes not only fighters from all over the Middle East and Africa, but also from the current Iraqi military and from Saddam's military, which U.S. forces thought they had defeated or dispersed. Many of those former Iraqi military forces brought their American-made and American-paid-for military equipment and their American military training with them into ISIS.\n\nIn the 11 years since the United States invaded Iraq and in the 13 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan, American troops have been training new Iraqi and Afghan armies. During that time of training, many of those U.S.-trained troops joined the ISIS resistance. The U.S.-trained troops that stayed in the Iraqi military are a rag-tag band of second-rate soldiers who are unable to defend the Iraqi government against ISIS. President Obama's military advisers have reportedly told him this.\n\nSome of the training has taken place in the United States, and some of those trainees left their instructors, fled a U.S. Army base, and were at large in the U.S. with their weapons. Under the watch of the U.S.-trained Iraqi soldiers, one-third to one-half of the land mass of Iraq has fallen to ISIS. ISIS, though barbaric and ruthless and decidedly undemocratic, has established governments in the lands it conquered, financed schools and hospitals, and operated as the only government in the land, as Saddam did. Those governments are selling oil to finance themselves, as Saddam did.\n\nThe forces in the United States who believe the military is best when it is fighting are again beating the drums for war in Iraq. President Obama's current plans are to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels and induce them to fight ISIS on the ground while the United States provides air cover. However, the U.S. may not be able to tell the moderate Syrian fighters from the fanatical Syrian fighters, as they are one and the same fighters, whose moderation or fanaticism changes with the politics and military needs of the moment.\n\nAmerican empire building and military adventurism and going about the world looking for monsters to slay have caused this mess. The American government refuses to recognize its failures, and the United States is about to embark on the same thing all over again. All this has not made a single American freer or safer, but rather has made the American government paranoid and the American people less free and poorer and more vulnerable. The government here can not recognize its failures, and a people who can not understand the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them. What do we do about it?",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor Advocates for Court Diversity Amidst Nomination Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at Brooklyn Law School on Friday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor emphasized the need for greater diversity in the nation's highest court and the legal profession as a whole. Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, did not directly address the current nomination process, but her comments come amidst a vacancy that has refocused attention on the court's makeup.\n\nDuring her talk, Sotomayor criticized the current composition of the court, stating, \"I, for one, do think there is a disadvantage from having (five) Catholics, three Jews, everyone from an Ivy League school, [and] no one who practiced criminal defense law outside white-collar settings.\" She highlighted the lack of racial, religious, and educational diversity, as well as the geographical and professional backgrounds of the justices.\n\nSotomayor's comments echo previous statements she and some of her colleagues have made regarding the benefits of a more diverse court. However, her remarks on Friday were made in the context of a nomination process that has been in an unusual limbo since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in January.\n\nWith the opportunity for Democratic President Barack Obama to fill a seat that could shift the court's ideological balance, Senate Republicans have stated they will not consider confirming anyone before the November presidential election. In response, some liberal groups had hoped Obama would nominate another woman or minority, but he instead chose Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nGarland, who is white, Jewish, and has an Ivy League background, is a former prosecutor with a career in the capital and a centrist reputation. The White House may have hoped his reputation would put pressure on Republicans to consider him, but he does not add racial or religious diversity to the court.\n\nSotomayor did not mention Garland or the nomination process during her talk. However, in response to diversity-related questions from Brooklyn Law students, she emphasized the importance of varied backgrounds in fostering better understanding and communication among justices. She recounted a 2009 oral argument in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that the all-male court had incorrectly equated a strip-search of a middle-school girl to changing for gym class in a locker room because they had \"never been a 13-year-old girl.\" The court ultimately ruled, 8-1, that the search was unconstitutional.\n\nSotomayor reiterated that decisions should be based on the law, not personal viewpoints or experiences. However, she also stressed that a diverse perspective can help justices \"understand the arguments that are before you and help you articulate your position in a way that everyone will understand.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tweets Disrupt G7 Consensus on Trade Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nLA MALBAIE, Quebec (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets criticizing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his decision to back out of the joint communique of the Group of Seven (G7) summit disrupted the fragile consensus on the trade dispute between Washington and its top allies.\n\nTrump's tweets followed Trudeau's press conference where he spoke of retaliatory measures Canada would take next month in response to Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump criticized Trudeau for being \"dishonest & weak\" and accused him of making \"very false statements\" about U.S. tariffs. Trudeau's office responded by stating that the Prime Minister had not said anything he had not said before, both in public and in private conversations with the President.\n\nGermany and France continued to support the \"jointly agreed communique\" despite Trump's decision to back away. French President Emmanuel Macron had earlier labeled the summit a success, saying there was relief within the G7 that an escalation of the trade dispute had been avoided.\n\nTrump's reversal, announced while he was en route to Singapore for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, sent his G7 partners scrambling. The communique, which appeared to have papered over the cracks that have surfaced in the G7, said the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan agreed on the need for \"free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade\" and the importance of fighting protectionism.\n\nTrump's decision to back out of the communique could signal a further escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and its allies. The prospect of Trump moving toward an even greater protectionist trade policy is likely to chill financial markets worried about tit-for-tat escalation that could lead to a full-blown global trade war.\n\nTrump has announced tariffs of up to $150 billion on Chinese goods over U.S. complaints of Beijing's trade practices and its alleged theft of U.S. technology. China has vowed to retaliate in equal measure. Canada, Mexico, and the EU are also moving ahead with their own levies on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs on U.S. imports of cars and auto parts would devastate the Canadian auto industry, which is highly integrated with the U.S. sector. They could also damage Japan and Germany. The Trump administration announced two weeks ago that it would investigate whether auto imports hurt U.S. national security, the first step toward tariffs similar to the ones he imposed on steel and aluminum imports last week.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Trump told reporters it would be \"very easy\" to make the case for tariffs on auto imports using the rationale that they threaten national security. Such a move could make it nearly impossible to renegotiate the terms of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump repeated his desire to have a sunset clause in an updated NAFTA deal, a demand Trudeau rejected again.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Face Hypocrisy Allegations as Trump's Supreme Court Nominee is Announced\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, NBC's Chuck Todd criticized Senate Republicans for potentially confirming President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee during an election year, a move that Todd described as a \"hypocrisy muscle\" being \"fully pulled.\"\n\nTodd's comments come after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, and Trump announced that he would pick a nominee from a previously released list of candidates. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the Senate will vote on Trump's pick this fall.\n\nIn 2016, McConnell led the effort to block the nomination of President Obama's final Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, arguing that the seat opened up too late in Obama's term and that the \"American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nTodd suggested that McConnell will have to make a strong case to confirm Trump's nominee ahead of the midterm elections, arguing that it is an \"insult to voters\" to suggest that their opinion only matters in presidential election years, not midterms.\n\nSeveral Senate Democrats have already pushed back against McConnell's announcement, calling it hypocritical and arguing that the chamber should wait until after the 2018 midterm elections to vote on any Supreme Court nominee. Democrats would need help from Republicans, who hold a slim 51-seat majority in the Senate, to block Trump's forthcoming pick. Republicans went \"nuclear\" and got rid of a 60-vote procedural hurdle when they confirmed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
    " Title: Unrest in Charlotte: Protests, Injuries, and National Guard Deployment Following Police Shooting of Keith Lamont Scott\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man by a black police officer in Charlotte, North Carolina, the city has been plunged into a series of violent protests. The shooting, which occurred on Tuesday, has led to injuries, property damage, and a state of emergency declaration by the governor.\n\nAccording to Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney, Mr. Scott exited his vehicle armed with a handgun, and despite officers' repeated commands to drop the weapon, he was shot. However, Scott's family maintains that he did not possess a gun but was carrying a book.\n\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot, Brentley Vinson, was not wearing a body camera, but three other officers on the scene were. The Charlotte Police Department has declined to release the footage, citing it as evidence in the ongoing investigation. This decision has only served to fuel the anger of protestors, leading to violent demonstrations on Wednesday night.\n\nOne civilian was shot in the head and is currently on life-support, while four police officers were injured during the protests. Journalists covering the events found themselves under attack, with a CNN reporter being pushed to the ground on live television, and another reporter being attempted to be thrown into a bonfire but was saved by police intervention.\n\nGovernor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, calling in the National Guard and state police to help restore order. The shooting in Charlotte, along with separate incidents in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have prompted statements from both presidential candidates, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, who has been a vocal supporter of law and order, expressed his concern over the shooting in Oklahoma and called for a national expansion of the \"stop-and-frisk\" policy. Clinton, on the other hand, has made curbing gun violence and police brutality a central part of her campaign. She stated, \"It's unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nWith the latest police shooting controversies and the recent terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, these issues are now guaranteed to be on the front burner for Monday's first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump.",
    " Title: NBC's Megyn Kelly Under Fire for Interview with Alex Jones, Critics Call for Boycott\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, NBC host Megyn Kelly has granted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones a platform to question the authenticity of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in one of the first sit-down interviews of her new Sunday night show. The decision has sparked outrage on social media, with calls for a boycott of NBC and advertisers pulling their support from the network.\n\nThe backlash began after a teaser for the show was released, which will air this Sunday. The preview shows Kelly grilling Jones on his claims, but critics argue that the interview risks validating Jones and disseminating his unfounded theories. In a statement, Kelly defended the program, stating that she interviewed Jones to \"shine a light\" on an increasingly important media figure. An NBC executive also defended the program, saying there was value in having Jones sit down for an interview.\n\nHowever, many argue that the interview format is not suitable for covering Jones, who is known for his outlandish and unsubstantiated claims. The parents of the Sandy Hook victims have been particularly vocal in their criticism of the interview, with Nelba M\u00e1rquez-Greene, whose daughter Ana Grace was killed in the massacre, tweeting, \"Every week. 5 years later. Still harassed by truthers. You do NOT give crazy a platform. You're better than this @ nbc.\"\n\nJones has gained prominence in recent years, with his show Infowars reaching millions of viewers each month. However, his lies have had real-world consequences, including the harassment of the Sandy Hook victims' families and the so-called Pizzagate scandal, which led to a man walking into a pizza shop in Washington, D.C., with a gun.\n\nThe interview comes at a time when the media is under attack by the president, who has praised Jones and perpetuated falsehoods that originated on the show. The White House recently gave Infowars press credentials.\n\nCritics argue that the interview sends a dangerous message that hoaxers like Jones are worthy of an hour of primetime TV to share their ideas. Instead of airing the sit-down, NBC could have used the opportunity to educate viewers about Jones' false claims and provide context on how he has gained such a large following.\n\nThe network could also have used the interview to explain to viewers the real-world consequences of Jones' lies, including the harassment of the Sandy Hook victims' families and the Pizzagate scandal. For now, the teaser suggests that Jones will be given lots of latitude to promulgate nonsense, which has sparked outrage among critics and the families of the Sandy Hook victims.",
    " Title: Amazon Suspends Police Use of Facial Recognition Technology for a Year, Citing Lack of Regulation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Amazon has announced a one-year moratorium on police forces using its facial recognition technology, citing the need for federal regulation of the surveillance tool. The decision comes after years of pressure from police reform advocates and privacy activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), over concerns about racial bias and potential misuse of the technology.\n\nIn a blog post on Wednesday, Amazon stated that it has been advocating for stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology. The company believes that Congress is ready to take on this challenge, and it hopes the moratorium will provide enough time for appropriate rules to be implemented.\n\nNicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director of the ACLU of Northern California, responded to the announcement, stating, \"Face recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us wherever we go. It fuels police abuse.\" Ozer called for a halt to the technology, emphasizing the need for stricter regulation.\n\nLiz O' Sullivan, a privacy activist and founder of Arthur AI, described the announcement as a \"victory for activists and academics\" who have been pushing for stricter regulation of facial recognition for years. However, she noted that the moratorium is a recognition that the system of surveillance is flawed, biased, and has racial implications. O' Sullivan called for the moratorium to be made permanent and urged activists and the public to pressure local policymakers to ensure any regulation serves the people, not corporate interests.\n\nThe one-year moratorium does not apply to organizations working closely with law enforcement to identify victims of child sexual exploitation and human trafficking, such as nonprofit Thorn, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Marinus Analytics.\n\nIn July 2018, the ACLU conducted a test of Amazon Rekognition and found it incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress, identifying them as other people who had been arrested for a crime. At the time, Amazon attributed the high number of false positives to the ACLU setting the \"confidence rate\" in the system lower than the recommended level.\n\nThe announcement follows a similar pledge from IBM, with CEO Arvind Krishna writing a letter to Congress on Monday, stating that the company would no longer develop or research facial recognition technology. Krishna expressed opposition to the use of facial recognition technology for \"mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms.\" He called for a national dialogue on the employment of facial recognition technology by domestic law enforcement agencies.",
    " Title: Trump-Russia Connections: A Tangled Web of Allegations and Denials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the heated 2016 U.S. presidential race, questions about Republican nominee Donald Trump's connections with Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, have intensified. The Guardian, a major British newspaper, has reported on an increasingly complex web of ties between Trump and key players in his campaign, particularly his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nTrump himself fueled the growing speculation this week when he urged Russia to find and release more than 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton's private email server, and later claimed in a Fox News interview that he was being sarcastic. However, a law enforcement official told The New York Times that the same hackers who breached the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's emails had also hacked Clinton's campaign computer system.\n\nAlina Polyakova, deputy director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, told The Guardian, \"This kind of meddling in other countries\u2019 affairs is part of Russia\u2019s toolkit. It\u2019s a kind of asymmetric warfare.\"\n\nTrump's foreign policy adviser, Joseph Schmitz, denied any connection between Trump and Putin, but noted, \"We had to negotiate with Joseph Stalin when we had a common enemy called Hitler. Bill Clinton went on vacation in Russia when he was a Rhodes scholar; that\u2019s a fact. If anyone is in bed with Russia, it\u2019s the Clintons.\"\n\nCNN's Drew Griffin also examined Trump's ties with Russia, including a revelation that Trump had trademarked several combinations of his namesake properties in Russia. Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign servers were allegedly attacked by a group known as \"Fancy Bear,\" which is connected to Russia's military intelligence service and is also linked to the hack on the Democratic National Committee, leading to the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe speculation is further fueled by the removal of a call to arm Ukraine against Russia from the Republican platform, a move several Republicans have also criticized. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman called the change \"deeply troubling,\" while party operative Charlie Black added that the change was \"unusual.\"\n\nThe focus on Manafort has also intensified. Manafort's role in the campaign has grown, particularly after the departure of former campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski. Just six years ago, Manafort was helping pro-Russia Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych change his image, leading to his election in Ukraine. Sources told The Guardian that they were surprised to see Phil Griffin, one of Manafort's longtime aides in Kiev, working at the Republican convention with foreign dignitaries.\n\nManafort has also made millions for consulting work for helping pro-Russians Rinat Akhmetov, Dmitry Firtash, and Oleg Deripaska. Firtash is under U.S. indictment, while Deripaska is banned from entering the United States because of his connection with organized crime. The FBI is investigating who was behind leaking the DNC's documents, which showed the committee was pushing for Clinton over Bernie Sanders for the nomination.\n\nMoscow denies the connection, insisting that the United States not involve the Kremlin with its issues. However, experts say Putin has been behind several attempted election cyberattack interruptions in France, Greece, Italy, and Latvia. Malware was also discovered in Ukraine's election software in 2014.\n\nTrump's ties with Russia go back as far as 1987, when it was still the Soviet Union. More recently, in 2013, Trump traveled to Moscow to meet with Putin to discuss airing his Miss Universe beauty pageant from there. Putin cancelled the meeting at the last minute, sending Trump a note and a traditional gift of a lacquered box. Moscow billionaire Aras Agalarov, who was a liaison between Trump and Putin, told The Washington Post.\n\nHe also collected $14 million from Agalarov and other business figures for bringing the pageant to Crocus City Hall, which the Russian billionaire owns. Trump also met with Russian pop stars, including rapper Timati and Philipp Kirkorov, who he first met in 1994 when the singer was performing at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. He also spent time there with Trump in 1999 and 2013, and told The Guardian they did not talk about politics, but \"about the beauty of Russian and American women.\"\n\nTrump also sold his six-acre Palm Beach mansion property in 2008 for $95 million to Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. In the infamous Panama Papers leaks, Rybolovlev has hidden more than $2 billion in paintings by artists such as Picasso through offshore law firms from his wife before their divorce.\n\nConservative columnist George Will, who opposes Trump's election, on Friday wrote an extensive opinion piece for The Washington Post linking Trump with Putin, who he says is \"etching with acid a picture of America as ignorant, narcissistic, and, especially, unreliable.\" Trump validates every component of this indictment, even saying that the U.S. commitment to NATO's foundational principle\u2014an attack on one member is an attack on all\u2014is not categorical.",
    " Title: Vice President Biden Acknowledges Potential Shortfall in Obamacare Enrollment Target, Maintains Health Law's Viability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent address, Vice President Joe Biden admitted that the Obama administration may not meet its initial enrollment target for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This acknowledgment comes as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted similar numbers, lowering its prediction for first-year enrollment from 7 million to 6 million.\n\nDuring an unscheduled stop in Minneapolis, Biden stated, \"We may not get to seven, we may get to five or six, and that's a hell of a start.\" This admission is consistent with CBO's latest budget outlook, which was released earlier this month.\n\nHealth policy expert Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, explained that the lower figure is unlikely to significantly impact the health law as a whole. He stated, \"The overall enrollment number is essentially an arbitrary figure that comes from CBO's original projections of what they thought the bill would do.\"\n\nTotal enrollment is important for the law's success in its central goal of increasing the number of insured Americans. However, according to Levitt, the health of the people signing up is more crucial to the law's viability. \"What's much more important in the first years is they get the right mix of enrollees so the insurance market is stable,\" Levitt said. \"Regardless of how many people are enrolling, what matters a lot more is that they're getting healthy people as well as sick people.\"\n\nThe first indication of the administration's success in recruiting a diverse group of enrollees will come over the summer, as insurance companies begin submitting their rates for 2015. If premiums for 2015 increase, it will suggest that the customers who have enrolled are sicker than expected. Conversely, if premiums stay steady or decrease, it will indicate that the pool of customers who signed up in 2013 and 2014 met expectations.\n\nThe impact of lower total enrollment on the broader goal of expanding health coverage may be challenging to quantify. Under the new law, access to insurance is not limited to the exchange. Millions have already been enrolled through state Medicaid offices, and countless others have purchased insurance off the exchange, either directly from an insurance company or through a broker or private insurance marketplace.\n\nLater this year, population surveys will provide information on the number of uninsured individuals, but this data may not reflect the entire six-month open-enrollment period. In the spring, insurance companies will begin filing quarterly reports to state regulators detailing how many people they insure, and organizations like Kaiser will aggregate that data to create a nationwide picture.\n\nLevitt, however, points out that even this data may be problematic. \"We'll probably have a data brawl over these numbers for the rest of the year,\" Levitt said. \"We'll be able to see how many more people are insured, how many fewer people are uninsured. What's not knowable is what would've happened in the absence of the Affordable Care Act.\"",
    " Title: NRA's Influence on Elections Wanes as Americans Grow Disillusioned\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from the past three decades, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has seen a decline in its influence on elections, as Americans grow increasingly disillusioned with the organization's stance on gun control. This change in sentiment was highlighted in a series of lectures delivered by former President Bill Clinton at Georgetown University this week.\n\nClinton, during a question-and-answer session, likened the NRA's influence to a cat that has learned to avoid a hot stove. \"You know that old story about the cat that sits on a hot stove is that cat will never sit on a hot stove again, but also it will never sit on a cold stove,\" Clinton mused.\n\nFor decades, the NRA has been known for its massive spending and grass-roots campaigns, often swaying elections in favor of candidates who support gun rights. However, recent surveys by Public Policy Polling and Quinnipiac University suggest that the public's sentiment towards the NRA has cooled.\n\nSeveral senators who voted against background checks have seen a drop in their approval ratings. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's overall approval rating dropped 8% from February to April. In Ohio, Sen. Rob Portman's rating went down 9% since October. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada saw his rating go down 3% since October/November. This trend is particularly concerning for the NRA, as it is happening in traditionally pro-gun rights states.\n\nThe shift in public opinion could signal a change in the political landscape, particularly for the more conservative members of the Republican Party who are seen as inextricably linked to the NRA in the public's mind. With the growing outrage over gun violence, Republicans may find themselves in a precarious position, especially when their stance on gun control is contrasted with the tragic consequences of gun violence.\n\nThis week, New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who voted against background checks, was confronted with this reality during a town hall meeting. Erica Lafferty, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal at Sandy Hook and among the first to be gunned down, asked Ayotte, \"You had mentioned that day the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would harm. I am just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't more important than that.\"\n\nAyotte defended her vote, but questions like Lafferty's are likely to persist. As the gun issue continues to unfold on the national stage, it remains to be seen how this will impact the political landscape. If senators lose support due to their opposition to gun control regulations, it is possible that some may reconsider their positions.\n\nThis shift in the political climate has been evident in the debate over immigration reform. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised to bring the matter to the floor again in light of the popular support for immigration reform. It is possible that we may even see a background check bill return to the Senate later in the year. However, the gerrymandered House presents a different challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, the heat may finally be on the NRA, and for senators who voted against background checks, it seems they have jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.",
    " Title: Hong Kong District Council Elections and U.S. Congressional Bills: A Turning Point for Hong Kong's Democratic Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, Hong Kong's pro-democracy candidates secured nearly 90% of the 452 district council seats in Sunday's poll, marking a significant victory for the democratic movement in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. This landslide election win, following months of pro-democracy unrest, has been interpreted by both sides as a clear repudiation of China's rule.\n\nThe election results have been met with a wave of jubilation among the pro-democracy camp, who view this as a fresh opportunity to cultivate Hong Kong's democratic spirit. Organizers of the 2014 Umbrella Movement have expressed optimism, stating that the pro-democracy camp's victory will not fix the democratic deficit in Hong Kong's other institutions but will provide a solid foundation for the future.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Congress has approved two bills aimed at supporting human rights in Hong Kong. The bills, which now await President Donald Trump's signature, request annual evaluations of Hong Kong's adherence to the rule of law and protection of enumerated rights. This move has been welcomed by Hong Kongers, who have been waving American flags and singing American anthems, expressing their desire for the freedom to choose.\n\nThe election results and the passage of the U.S. bills have been seen as a clear message to Beijing, with many urging President Trump to sign the bills into law. Critics of President Trump argue that a veto would betray America's values and be a show of weakness to China.\n\nAs Hong Kongers continue to push for greater democracy and freedom, the competition between China's authoritarian system and the values of democracy and a rules-based international order remains a significant factor in the relationship between the U.S. and China. The trade deal, if it is to be worth anything, must be sturdy enough to survive amid the pressures and crosscurrents in the relationship.\n\nThe election results and the passage of the U.S. bills mark a significant turning point in Hong Kong's democratic movement. The pro-democracy camp will now lay a solid foundation for the future, with the hope that when Hong Kongers are ready to fully and freely exercise real democracy, they will be ready for it.",
    " Title: Russian Influence in Bulgaria's Energy Sector: A Case Study of South Stream and Shale Gas Exploration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move reminiscent of Russian influence in other European countries, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly courted Bulgaria's pro-Russian far-right party to thwart plans for Bulgarian shale gas exploration. This strategic move was aimed at securing support for the South Stream pipeline project, which faced opposition due to geological surveys suggesting Bulgaria's potential self-sufficiency in natural gas.\n\nIn 2011, the South Stream project, estimated to cost over $40 billion, faced a setback in Bulgaria, where the pipeline was due to make landfall after traversing the Black Sea. The discovery of potentially vast natural gas reserves within Bulgaria's territory could have made the country energy self-sufficient for years and overshadowed the advantages of the South Stream project.\n\nBulgaria, a former Soviet ally, shares linguistic, religious, and cultural similarities with Russia, and celebrates its liberation from the Ottoman Empire by the troops of the czar as a national holiday. Bulgarian leaders supported the South Stream project, arguing that the pipeline would provide not just transit fees but energy security, as the country receives 90% of its gas from Russia via a route through Ukraine, which has left it vulnerable to pricing disputes between Moscow and Kiev.\n\nIn the winter of 2009, Bulgaria experienced a two-week gas shortage when Russia halted gas supplies to teach Ukraine a lesson. In the midst of 2011, Bulgaria's prime minister, Boiko Borisov, granted Chevron a permit to explore for shale gas. However, a well-organized campaign emerged to halt shale gas exploration, partly fueled by supporters of the far-right Ataka party, which has been cultivated by Mr. Putin in Europe.\n\nAccording to Volen Siderov, the chairman of Ataka, his party received no direct funds from Moscow. However, the appeal is not solely ideological, as evidenced by the National Front in France acknowledging a loan of 9 million euros from a Kremlin-linked bank. The far-right parties in Europe, such as Jobbik in Hungary and the Northern League in Italy, view Mr. Putin as a bulwark against Western liberalism.",
    " Title: \"Isaac Asimov's 1959 Essay on Creativity: A Timeless Guide for Spurring Innovation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 1959, renowned author and biochemistry professor Isaac Asimov penned an essay on the formation of ideas and the cultivation of creativity. Fifty-five years later, the essay was discovered by Asimov's friend, scientist Arthur Obermayer, and published by MIT Technology Review. The essay was written as a contribution to a research group funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, with the aim of eliciting the most creative approaches for a ballistic missile defense system.\n\nAsimov eventually left the group due to his reluctance to handle classified or secret information, but his essay on creativity remains relevant to this day. In the essay, Asimov delves into the question, \"How do people get new ideas?\"\n\nAsimov draws parallels between the process of creativity and the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection, citing the work of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace. He emphasizes the importance of making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas, which he terms \"cross-connections.\"\n\nAccording to Asimov, the ability to make cross-connections is cultivated through specific personality and societal factors. He writes, \"Making the cross-connection requires a certain daring. It must, for any cross-connection that does not require daring is performed at once by many and develops not as a 'new idea,' but as a mere 'corollary of an old idea.'\"\n\nAsimov also discusses the role of isolation in the creative process, stating, \"It must, for any cross-connection that does not require daring is performed at once by many and develops not as a 'new idea,' but as a mere 'corollary of an old idea.'\" However, he also provides insights into fostering creativity in groups, suggesting that a group of five individuals in a relaxed and permissive environment is ideal for cultivating group creativity.\n\nAsimov's ideas, written before the rise of Silicon Valley and the culture of start-ups, seem prescient in today's society. His essay serves as a timeless guide for spurring innovation, reminding us to take a moment to make true, daring new connections and to embrace the eccentricities that often accompany creativity.",
    " Title: West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Robin Jean Davis Resigns Amid Impeachment, Spending Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Robin Jean Davis of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals tendered her resignation early Tuesday, following the state House of Delegates' impeachment of all justices on the court. The resignation marks the end of a two-decade tenure on the bench, which has been marked by allegations of ethical lapses.\n\nAt a press conference in Charleston, West Virginia, Davis stated, \"We judges weigh evidence as part of our jobs. Unfortunately, the evidence clearly shows that the preconceived, result-driven mania among the majority party members in the legislature cannot result in a just and fair outcome.\"\n\nDavis, along with three of her colleagues, was impeached by the state legislature on Monday. Chief Justice Margaret Workman and Justices Allen Loughry and Elizabeth Walker will now face trial in the state senate. Menis Ketchum, the fifth member of the court, resigned on July 27 and is expected to plead guilty to two corruption charges in federal court on Aug. 29.\n\nThe impeachment articles accuse the justices of mismanaging the state courts, exceeding statutory limits for compensation for senior judges, and abusing state resources through extravagant renovations to their chambers and unauthorized use of state vehicles for personal travel. (RELATED : West Virginia's Highest Court Shattered by Corruption Indictment)\n\nGOP Governor Jim Justice will appoint successors to any justice removed from office following the Senate trial. Local media and state auditors discovered the justices collectively spent over $1 million on furniture and aesthetic upgrades for their state offices, with Davis reportedly spending $500,000, including $23,000 for design services and $20,000 for a sectional carpet.\n\nDavis's extravagant spending is the latest in a series of ethical questions surrounding her judicial service. In 2002, The Wall Street Journal reported that Davis participated in a case from which her husband, a successful plaintiffs lawyer, stood to financially benefit. A legal ethics expert who taught Davis and her husband at the West Virginia University College of Law suggested that Davis should have recused herself from the matter.\n\nIn August 2016, \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation reported that Davis sold her family's private jet to an attorney named Michael Fuller. Two years after the sale, Fuller defended a $95-million judgment before the West Virginia Supreme Court. Despite the potential conflict, Davis wrote an opinion for the court preserving a significant portion of that award.\n\nTheDCNF uncovered evidence in March 2017 that a Florida-based corporate entity funneled thousands of dollars to her 2012 reelection campaign through an illegal straw donation scheme at the behest of the same attorney to whom Davis sold her plane. (RELATED : New Evidence of Illegal Donations to West Virginia Judge Emerges)\n\nThe West Virginia secretary of state opened an investigation, though charges were never brought due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\nIn her Tuesday press conference, a defiant Davis characterized her service as honorable and accused state Republicans of orchestrating a plot to pack the court with conservatives.\n\n\"The people of West Virginia have honored me in three separate elections by placing their confidence in me as a justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals,\" she said. \"I have returned their faith by serving honorably for almost 22 years.\"\n\n\"I encourage each of you to watch this legislative process very carefully and to vote in November,\" she added.",
    " Title: Iran-Six Powers Nuclear Talks Extend Beyond Deadline, Progress Made but Challenges Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense and protracted negotiation, Iran and six world powers, including the United States, extended their nuclear talks beyond the set deadline on Tuesday, casting doubt on the possibility of reaching a final agreement to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nAs the early hours of Wednesday approached, there were signs of progress toward building a framework outlining elements of a final nuclear deal, with a June 30 deadline for its completion. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf stated, \"We've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday. There are several difficult issues still remaining.\" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also indicated that work would resume on Wednesday morning.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to his spokeswoman, reported that the sides had reached an agreement in principle. The parties would try to finalize a text later on Wednesday, she added. However, people involved in the talks have stated that many tough details would still be left over even if a framework agreement is reached.\n\nThe two main sticking points are the timetable for lifting United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran and the question of what nuclear work Tehran would be permitted to do in the final years of an agreement. Late Tuesday night, diplomats reported some progress but differences on these points remained.\n\nThe Obama administration was forced to concede to the third delay in less than a year in the talks, sparking new criticism from Congress about the direction of the White House Iran policy. The deadline has been seized upon by U.S. lawmakers who have warned that they would push for fresh sanctions legislation on Iran if a framework agreement isn't reached on time.\n\nMany lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, believe the terms of the deal won't go far enough in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Senate Republicans are pushing legislation in April that would give Congress the power to approve, amend, or kill any deal announced by the Obama administration.\n\n\"The decision to extend the nuclear negotiations in the face of Iranian intransigence and duplicity proves once again that Iran is calling the shots,\" said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Mr. Cotton penned a letter to Iran's leadership in March, signed by 47 Republican senators, that said Congress had the power to overrule any agreement signed by the White House.\n\nU.S. officials and other senior Western diplomats have said in the past few days that with Congress on recess, they had a few days more political space to hammer out the details. The talks have encountered few successes since they began in early 2014. Negotiators failed to meet two deadlines in July and November last year, setting Tuesday as the final day to reach a framework of an agreement and the end of June as the deadline for a comprehensive deal.\n\nPresident Barack Obama in February said he saw little point to any further delays. An Iranian diplomat told state-run television on Tuesday that some progress had been made on the sanctions issues. \"We don't want an agreement at any price. We want to guarantee the Iranian people's honor and rights...Our goal is this. Time won't stop us,\" said the senior negotiator, Hamid Baeedinejad.\n\nThe U.S. and its European partners at the talks have long said Iran would only win phased sanctions relief with some U.N. restrictions on nuclear-related trade remaining in place. However, Iran was pushing for sanctions relief up front. Iran was also doubling down on its insistence that after 10 years, it would have no tight restrictions on its nuclear program, including its research work, Western diplomats said. U.S. and European officials have said some of those constraints must stay in place.\n\nAfter an official said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius could leave early Wednesday morning, a senior U.S. official said there was no discussion of giving Iran an immediate ultimatum to make concessions or end the diplomacy. The Obama administration has made an Iranian nuclear agreement its main foreign-policy goal, hoping both to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power and thaw the deeply hostile relationship between the two countries since the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nHowever, over the past 18 months, as the diplomacy has heated up, the U.S. and its partners have dropped a number of conditions they once set for a deal. As the diplomacy has dragged on, skepticism has risen in Washington and elsewhere that a strong deal can be reached. Critics of the diplomacy say the U.S. and other powers have accepted terms that will embolden Iran in regional power struggles and do little over time to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. Fueling that debate will be the many questions an agreement will leave unanswered.\n\nU.S. officials have said the deal is a good compromise, which will meet its central goal of blocking any of Iran's paths to an atomic weapon. Western officials say they believe they can achieve their central demand that Iran will be at least a year away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb for at least a decade. Missing Tuesday's deadline has no automatic consequences for the talks. The interim agreement reached in November 2013 remains in effect until the end of June. At various points in the past decade, the negotiations have appeared on the brink of collapse, raising the prospect of a military conflict with Iran. While diplomats had appeared confident earlier in the day that a deal could be reached Tuesday, officials described discussions as hard-going as the talks dragged on. A German delegation official said the negotiations had been very tough.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Recalibrates 2016 Presidential Campaign Stances, Distancing Herself from Obama on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nOne week into her 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun to adjust her 2008 campaign positions, seeking to find a balance that appeals to both the Democratic primary and general election voters.\n\nOn the issue of same-sex marriage, Mrs. Clinton now supports the legal recognition of same-sex marriages and wants the Supreme Court to overturn state laws defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This shift in stance mirrors President Obama's evolution, who also opposed gay marriage in the 2008 campaign but has since re-evaluated his position.\n\nIn terms of immigration, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has stated that she supports the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, a position that was a stumbling block during her last presidential campaign.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Mrs. Clinton, who previously supported free trade, has distanced herself from President Obama by expressing reservations about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that the president is negotiating. Her campaign stated that she will closely monitor the TPP to ensure it addresses issues such as currency manipulation, labor rights, environmental protection, transparency, and opportunities for small businesses to export overseas.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton has also begun to draw more distinct lines with the president. For instance, she has expressed an openness to allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, a policy that was not included in President Obama's healthcare overhaul.\n\nRepublican hopefuls and potential Democratic nomination opponents have suggested that these shifts are more political than ideological. The Republican National Committee issued a memo stating, \"The takeaway here: nothing is authentic in Clinton World.\"\n\nIn response, Mrs. Clinton's surrogates have insisted on her authenticity. Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, described her as \"warm and engaging, compassionate and tough.\" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton backer, stated that the Republicans' focus on Mrs. Clinton's shifting positions is beneficial to her politically.\n\nMeanwhile, potential Democratic nomination opponents have found it challenging to gain recognition as they navigate the political talk shows. Hosts have repeatedly asked them to differentiate themselves from Mrs. Clinton, with former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia suggesting that the country is experiencing incumbent fatigue and is looking for fresh approaches to solve the nation's problems.\n\nFor the most part, these candidates have declined to attack, instead leaving it to voters to decide the Democratic field. However, not without some subtle jabs, as Webb noted, \"People are going to decide. They're looking real hard at everyone. I think we have got a lot of incumbent fatigue in the country. And I think people are looking for fresh approaches in terms of how to solve the problems of the country.\"",
    " Title: Ongoing Investigations and Allegations of Russian Interference in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past year, the political landscape of the United States has been marked by a series of investigations and allegations surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This article provides an unbiased overview of the key events, individuals, and ongoing inquiries related to this complex issue.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016. The meeting was reportedly arranged to discuss damaging information about Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Veselnitskaya has denied working for the Kremlin, but she has been linked to various Russian-related lobbying groups in the past.\n\nThe meeting with Veselnitskaya follows a string of events involving Russian connections within the Trump campaign. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned less than a month into his job due to inaccurate statements about his contacts with Russian officials. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, also stepped down due to questionable Russian business interests.\n\nHowever, several intelligence officials from the Obama administration, including former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, have stated that they found no evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to influence the election.\n\nFormer FBI Director Robert Mueller is currently overseeing the investigation into potential Russian meddling as a special counsel. In addition, multiple agencies and congressional committees are conducting their own Russia-related investigations.\n\nOne of the ongoing inquiries revolves around the unmasking of Trump campaign officials' identities in surveillance files and the potential illegal leaking of their names to the media. This issue has led some members of Congress to question the actions of Obama-administration officials, such as Brennan, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice.\n\nAnother point of contention is the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy and opposition researcher Christopher Steele. The dossier contained allegations, some of which were Russia-related, that were later found to be unverified. Steele's firm reportedly had contacts with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n\nSenator John McCain acquired the anti-Trump dossier and ensured that the FBI investigated the unsubstantiated claims. The dossier was later leaked, with the website BuzzFeed publishing the entire document despite admitting that they could not verify its contents.\n\nAdditional allegations involve the Clinton campaign's ties to Russian interests. For example, John Podesta, a principal of the Clinton campaign, was a board member of a green-energy firm that received Russian investment. There are also ongoing investigations into whether Russian funds were funneled to American anti-fracking groups, such as Sea Change, to potentially influence U.S. energy policy.\n\nThe Russian government has suffered significant losses in oil revenue due to American fracking technology, which has led to a decrease in global energy prices. This economic strain may contribute to Putin's alleged efforts to undermine American energy exploration and production.\n\nThe ongoing investigations and allegations of Russian interference in U.S. politics have created a complex and contentious political environment. The list of individuals and organizations involved, as well as the various inquiries, has led some to question the stability and effectiveness of the U.S. government in addressing other critical global issues, such as North Korea's missile tests, Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the ongoing Syrian conflict.",
    " Title: Atlanta School Cheating Scandal: Thirty-Five Educators Indicted in Largest Standardized Testing Scandal in U.S. History\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, thirty-five teachers and administrators in Atlanta have until noon today to surrender to police, marking the beginning of a series of potential defendants in the largest standardized education testing scandal in American history. The alleged scheme, which has been described as a culture of cheating to benefit those at the top, has left many questioning the integrity of the city's school system.\n\nCBS reports that investigators accuse Atlanta's school district of orchestrating a systemic cheating scandal, where educators tampered with students' standardized tests and corrected answers to inflate scores. Some teachers reportedly organized pizza parties to erase wrong answers and circle in the correct ones, while one principal allegedly handled altered tests wearing gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.\n\nAt one middle school, 86 percent of eighth-graders scored proficient in math, compared to 24 percent the year before. Prosecutors claim that this progress was a criminal mirage. \"The four primary crimes that are charged in the indictment are the statements and writings, false swearings, theft by taking, and influencing witnesses,\" Fulton County District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. said.\n\nBeverly Hall, Atlanta's retired school superintendent, is among those indicted. Her system's turnaround won her national fame, awards, and over $500,000 in performance bonuses. However, investigators claim she pressured teachers and principals to cheat, and punished those who refused.\n\nOne of the victims of this alleged scheme is Nybria Collins, a 15-year-old student who is reading at a fifth-grade level. Despite failing her classes, she kept passing the standardized tests, leaving her mother to question what was happening at the public school. Instead of being prepared to succeed in adulthood, these \"educators\" left Nybria to fail for a lifetime while they had pizza parties to cover up their incompetence.\n\nThe indictments involve racketeering charges, which carry a maximum 20 years in prison. Compared to the length of the damage they did to students like Nybria, that seems a lenient sentence. Perhaps school choice will get a closer look, at least in Atlanta, as the public grapples with the implications of this shocking scandal.",
    " Title: Justice Anthony Kennedy's Retirement Speculation: A Potential Seismic Shift in the Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - Speculation surrounding the future of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has often been the deciding vote in some of the most contentious cases, is at an all-time high. The 80-year-old justice, who has not publicly addressed the rumors, has not indicated whether he will step down.\n\nOver the weekend, dozens of Kennedy's former law clerks gathered in Washington for a private reunion, fueling rumors that this might be their last chance to meet with him while he is still on the bench. During a dinner on Saturday, Kennedy made a light-hearted comment about an expected announcement, saying, \"The 'bar will be open after dinner.' However, sources close to Kennedy suggest that he is seriously considering retirement, although the timing remains unclear.\n\nJustice Kennedy's departure would mark a significant shift in the court's ideological balance and offer President Donald Trump an opportunity to continue reshaping the court. Trump's first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, a former Kennedy clerk, joined the court earlier this year.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Kennedy has been a pivotal figure in shaping the court's decisions on various issues. To liberals, he is a hero for his landmark opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, which cleared the way for same-sex marriage in 2015. To abortion rights supporters, Kennedy's vote to reaffirm the core holding of Roe v. Wade in 1992 is significant.\n\nHowever, Kennedy has also sided with the conservative justices on several issues, such as the Citizens United v. FEC case, which struck down election spending limits for corporations and unions, and the Shelby County v. Holder case, which invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nKennedy's age and the politicized nature of the confirmation process are factors to consider in his decision to retire. Retiring at 81 would not be significantly different than retiring at 80, and Kennedy would get to serve longer with Gorsuch as well as take up a case on the next term's docket concerning partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe political climate and the confirmation process's potential impact on Kennedy's replacement are other considerations. Kennedy might choose to remain on the bench until the political climate simmers down, although there is no guarantee that would ever happen. The confirmation process has become increasingly contentious, with Republicans changing Senate rules to make it easier to confirm Trump's nominees after Democrats objected.\n\nIn the end, Kennedy's decision will have a lasting impact on the Supreme Court and the issues it addresses. His replacement will likely be chosen from the list of 20 judges Trump has vowed to draw from when considering the next vacancy on the court. The choice will undoubtedly shape the court's ideological balance for years to come.",
    " Title: U.S. President Barack Obama's Approval Rating Drops to 47.9 Percent in 18th Quarter, According to Gallup Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nThe approval rating of U.S. President Barack Obama has dropped to 47.9 percent, marking the second consecutive quarter of decline, according to a recent Gallup poll. The survey, which was conducted among 45,000 American adults between April 20 and July 19, indicates a steady decline in Obama's approval rating since he first took office.\n\nObama's best quarterly approval average was 63 percent when he was first elected to the White House. Since then, the rating has dropped to a low of 41 percent in his 11th quarter, during a time when Obama was butting heads with Congress over the debt limit. Modest improvements followed, leading to a high of 51.9 percent in the 16th quarter after his re-election, according to Gallup data.\n\nThe release of these numbers comes as the president is set to deliver a series of economic speeches beginning Wednesday at Knox College in Illinois. Obama is also expected to push lawmakers further on immigration reform, an issue that has been a top second-term priority for him. The Democratic-led Senate has already passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill, but the GOP-led House of Representatives is stalling on the issue. Overhauling the immigration reform system is one of Obama's top second-term priorities, and he will need to get something out of Congress by the end of 2013 or next year before he becomes a lame-duck president.\n\nIt is worth noting that this poor showing in approval ratings is not unique to Obama. Several other second-term presidents have experienced similar declines, with some having much worse numbers. According to Gallup data, George W. Bush's 18th quarter approval was 47.3 percent, and Richard Nixon's was 44 percent. The picture was far more favorable for presidents Ronald Reagan with 58.7 percent, Bill Clinton with 56.3 percent, and Dwight Eisenhower with 63.6 percent.\n\nGallup noted that historically, the trend has been for presidents' approval ratings to decline in their 19th quarters in office. Nixon saw a steep decline due to the Watergate scandal, while Reagan and Clinton received high numbers because they \"presided over robust economies at that point in their presidencies.\"",
    " Title: Congress Approves Temporary Debt Limit Increase, Averting Government Default\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan vote on Thursday, Congress passed a bill to temporarily increase the federal borrowing limit, allowing the government to borrow approximately $450 billion to meet its obligations, including interest payments, Social Security benefits, and government salaries. The legislation now heads to President Obama, who has indicated he will sign it.\n\nThe bill temporarily suspends the current $16.4 trillion debt ceiling, a move that experts suggest will provide the government with the necessary funds to avoid a potential default as early as mid-February. The deadline for Congress to act again to prevent default is estimated to be August, according to calculations by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nThe short-term increase in the borrowing limit was a proposal from House Republicans, who aimed to restructure a series of upcoming budget battles, removing the threat of a government default and instead setting up a confrontation in March over automatic across-the-board spending cuts affecting the Pentagon and various domestic programs.\n\nThese cuts, postponed by the recent \"fiscal cliff\" deal, are the result of the 2011 deficit supercommittee's failure to reach an agreement. The panel was established as part of the hard-fought 2011 debt limit increase.\n\nDemocrats supported the debt increase, as it was not contingent on budget cuts, a long-standing demand from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Senate Republicans offered several amendments, but these were all rejected in party-line votes.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed an amendment to ensure that in the event of a cash crunch, the government would use available tax revenue to ensure bondholders, Social Security recipients, and the military receive their payments. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, sought to require that any immediate increase in the debt limit be paired with commensurate spending cuts, which could be spread out over 10 years.\n\nTo win over House GOP conservatives, Speaker Boehner attached a \"no budget, no pay\" provision to the bill, which would withhold pay for House and Senate members if the chamber in which they serve fails to pass a budget plan. This move was seen as a response to the Democratic-controlled Senate, which has not passed a budget blueprint since 2009.\n\nCongress has now shifted its focus to the across-the-board cuts, which would reduce this year's budget by $85 billion after being delayed from January 1 until March 1 and reduced by $24 billion due to the recently enacted tax bill. Defense hawks are particularly concerned, as the Pentagon cuts could severely impact military readiness and disrupt defense contracting. These cuts, known as a \"sequester\" in Washington-speak, were never intended to take effect but were instead meant to drive the two sides towards a large budget agreement.\n\nRepublicans and Obama now appear to be on a collision course over how to replace the across-the-board cuts. Obama and his Democratic allies insist that additional revenues be part of the solution, while Republicans argue that further tax increases are off the table after the 10-year, $600 billion-plus increase in taxes on wealthier earners forced upon Republicans by Obama earlier this month.",
    " Title: The Decline of Rick Santorum's Political Relevancy: A Study of Changing Political Landscape and Shifting Public Opinion\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up with Rand Paul's official announcement, it is worth examining the diminishing political relevance of another potential candidate, former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA). In 2016, Santorum, who came close to snatching the Republican nomination from Mitt Romney in the primaries, made headlines this week by voicing his support for Indiana's \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\" a controversial law that allows businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ customers.\n\nBefore delving into the connection between Santorum's stance on LGBTQ+ rights and his waning political influence, it is crucial to acknowledge that, for the past 40 years, the presumptive heir to the Republican presidential nomination has been the runner-up from previous years' primaries. This list includes Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. If this precedent were still in effect, former Senator Rick Santorum would at least be among the handful of frontrunners. Instead, he languishes in the single digits, a position he has held since the very beginning of this election cycle's polling.\n\nAccording to The Polling Report, Santorum has not surpassed 4 percent in over a year. The reason for this is as straightforward as it is significant: Santorum's political brand is inextricably linked to his staunch opposition to LGBTQ+ rights. While this might have been enough to make him a strong contender in the GOP primaries a decade ago, today, Americans are inexorably moving towards full legal equality for the LGBTQ+ community. This shift has hurt Santorum significantly, despite his other political weaknesses, such as his landslide loss in the Pennsylvania Senate race in 2006.\n\nMoreover, Republicans are less religiously-minded in their politics than they have been in the past. While many conservatives still express ostensible support for using religion to shape government policies, 7 in 10 perceive religion as losing its influence in American life, with secular and/or non-Christian religious beliefs increasing in the country even as church attendance and specific denominational loyalties continue to decline.\n\nThe Christian Right, as we know it today, is a particular and historically quirky breed, known for its religiously-tinted patriotism and conservative stances on issues like LGBTQ+ rights, the drug wars, opposition to the '60s counterculture, reproductive choice, and the separation of church and state. While it continues to influence the GOP to some extent, signs have emerged in the last two presidential elections that its grip on the party is weakening. Neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney focused on their religiosity in their respective presidential campaigns, a move that would have been unthinkable for a Republican presidential aspirant even a decade earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, the days when a candidate like Rick Santorum can play a dominant role in Republican Party politics may be numbered. The changing political landscape and shifting public opinion on LGBTQ+ rights, as well as the decline of organized Christianity's influence, have combined to make Santorum's political brand less appealing to the American electorate. While Christianity will continue to be a factor in American politics, the days of a candidate like Santorum finding significant success may be drawing to a close.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates' Stances on Climate Change and Economic Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing presidential race, both candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have outlined their plans regarding climate change and economic inequality.\n\nClinton, in her campaign, emphasizes the need for a strong commitment to combat climate change. She supports the Paris Climate Agreement and aims to cut emissions up to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Clinton also proposes a North American Climate Compact to collaborate with Canada and Mexico in reducing emissions and accelerating the clean energy transition across the continent.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has expressed skepticism about the severity of global warming. He criticizes Clinton's climate plan, stating it could cost the U.S. economy $5 trillion. Trump argues that policies like Clinton's have led to job losses in the U.S., with countries like China and Mexico benefiting from lower environmental standards.\n\nRegarding economic inequality, Clinton addresses the issue by stating that too many hardworking Americans are struggling. She aims to level the playing field and ensure that no one who works hard should live in poverty or worry about retirement.\n\nBoth candidates' plans reflect their unique perspectives on climate change and economic inequality, offering voters a choice in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: Senate's Trump Acquittal: A Closer Look at the Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Wednesday's impeachment vote, President Donald Trump's acquittal may appear as a popular vindication. However, a closer examination of the Senate's configuration reveals a different narrative. The Senate's decision to keep Trump in office is not solely due to popular support, but rather, it is a result of the Senate's systemic advantage for the Republican party.\n\nThe Senate, with its structure that grants equal representation to each state regardless of population, favors the less populous states. For instance, California, the most populous state, has 68 times the population of Wyoming, yet both states have two senators. This configuration means that Democrats, who control a majority of Senate seats representing the most populous half of the states, are outnumbered by Republicans in the Senate as a whole.\n\nIn the impeachment trial, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney was the sole Republican to join the Democratic caucus in voting to remove President Trump on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power. This means that the senators voting to convict represent approximately 170 million individuals, 18 million more than the bloc of senators who voted to acquit.\n\nTo derive these numbers, I used 2016 US Census data for each state's population. I created a two-column spreadsheet, with columns labeled \"acquit\" and \"convict.\" In each state where both senators voted to acquit, I allocated the full population of the state to the \"acquit\" column. Similarly, I allocated the full population of the state to the \"convict\" column in states where both senators voted to convict.\n\nIn states where the two senators split their vote, I allocated half the state's population to one column and half to the other. In total, the senators voting to acquit represent about 152 million individuals, while senators voting to convict represent about 170 million individuals.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in a Senate fairly apportioned by population, Democrats would still likely not have a large enough majority to remove a president. The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the members present for conviction, and in a fairly apportioned Senate, Democrats would have a majority, but not a large enough one to remove a president.\n\nNevertheless, the fact remains that senators representing about 53% of the nation voted to remove Trump from office. This is a far different narrative than the raw vote in the Senate suggests.",
    " Title: Dylann Roof, Suspect in Charleston Church Shooting, Captured in North Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old suspect in the shooting deaths of nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, has been apprehended in Shelby, North Carolina, following a massive manhunt.\n\nRoof was taken into custody during a traffic stop after police were alerted to suspicious activity, authorities said. The FBI had been searching for Roof since Thursday morning, describing him as a 5-foot-9, 120-pound white male driving a black 2000 Hyundai Elantra sedan.\n\nCharleston Police Chief Greg Mullen confirmed that Roof was the gunman who shot and killed nine people at the Emmanuel AME church during a Wednesday night prayer meeting. The FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division are conducting a hate crime investigation into the shooting.\n\nRoof had been arrested twice as an adult, once for a drug-related offense and once for trespassing. He was out on bond at the time of the shooting rampage, according to court records.\n\nThe shooting at Emmanuel AME church, one of the oldest black churches in the country, has shocked Charleston and sent shockwaves across the nation. Speaking on the floor of the U.S. House, Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, asked lawmakers to pray for the church and those impacted by the shooting.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush canceled a campaign event in Charleston on Thursday due to the shooting, while Sen. Lindsey Graham, another 2016 GOP presidential candidate, canceled scheduled campaign stops in Philadelphia and New Hampshire this weekend to return home.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, called for \"swift justice\" for those killed during the shooting. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been a fixture at scenes of racial unrest, said he was likely heading to Charleston to offer support.\n\nChief Mullen said investigators did not know if the suspect was still in the Charleston area. He said local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies on the East Coast had been alerted to be on the lookout for the suspect. Tips had already come in from across the country, he added.\n\nWhen police arrived on the chaotic scene Wednesday night, they found eight people shot dead inside the church. Another victim died later at a nearby hospital, police said. State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, who served as a pastor at the church, was among those killed, according to The Associated Press. Pinckney, 41, was a married father of two who was elected to the state house at age 23, making him the youngest member of the House at the time.\n\nThe attack came two months after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, by a white police officer in neighboring North Charleston that sparked major protests and highlighted racial tensions in the area. The officer has been charged with murder, and the shooting prompted South Carolina lawmakers to push through a bill helping all police agencies in the state get body cameras. Pinckney was a sponsor of that bill.\n\nIn a statement, Gov. Nikki Haley asked South Carolinians to pray for the victims and their families and decried violence at religious institutions. \"We'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,\" she said.\n\nThe police chief urged people to phone in tips to a hotline: 1-800-CALL-FBI. \"Regardless of how small people think that the information they have might be, we want them to call us,\" he said. \"We have investigative teams that are ready to go out and follow every lead sent in to this hotline number. And that's what we really need at this point.\"",
    " Title: Five Concerns for Libertarians in the New Year: Debt, Marijuana Legalization, Free Trade, Fake News, and Surveillance\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the clock ticks down on 2016, many are eager to usher in a new year. However, before popping the champagne, it's important to consider five areas of concern for libertarians in 2017.\n\n1. Marijuana Legalization: With most Americans supporting legalization, 2017 could be a challenging year for pro-legalization advocates. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for states' rights regarding marijuana, but his cabinet appointments, particularly Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have raised concerns. Sessions, a longtime opponent of legalization, has criticized the Obama administration and the Department of Justice for not enforcing federal marijuana laws.\n\n2. National Debt: In early 2017, the national debt is set to hit a record $20 trillion. Trump's policy proposals are estimated to add another $5.3 trillion over the next four years, inheriting a debt that has nearly doubled under President Obama.\n\n3. Free Trade: Globalization and free trade have historically lifted millions out of poverty and raised living standards across the United States. However, both Democrats and Republicans are questioning the fundamental value of free markets, and a new administration is promising to intervene in the affairs of private companies. Trump has also threatened a costly trade war with China.\n\n4. Fake News: Hillary Clinton recently labeled fake news an \"epidemic,\" and its consequences are now becoming a reality. Facebook is testing new plug-ins to limit misinformation and partnering with fact-checking groups to root out false news items, causing concerns of censorship on the popular social media platform.\n\n5. Surveillance: The FBI, NSA, and CIA are likely to see expanded surveillance powers under a Trump administration. Some of these changes are already happening, with a new rule allowing federal agents with a single search warrant to hack millions of Americans' computers or smartphones at once. The UK has also approved the Investigatory Powers bill, which gives the UK's global surveillance program authorities to create a new government database that will store the web history of every citizen in the country.\n\nProduced and written by Alexis Garcia.

    " Title: Trump and Macron Engage in Tense Exchange Over NATO, ISIS Fighters, and Digital Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense exchange on Tuesday, President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron clashed in London, with the American leader questioning Macron about taking back \"some nice ISIS fighters\" and criticizing his response as a \"non-answer.\" The exchange came just hours after Trump criticized Macron's rebuke of NATO, following the French president's comments that recent U.S. troop actions in Syria contributed to the \"brain death\" of the military alliance.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump asked Macron, \"I have not spoken to the president about that \u2014 would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I can give them to you, you can take every one you want.\" Macron responded by urging Trump to \"be serious\" and called for a broader push against ISIS overall. Trump then took another swipe, saying, \"This is why he\u2019s a great politician, because that\u2019s one of the greatest non-answers I\u2019ve ever heard.\"\n\nThe exchange came hours after Trump criticized Macron's comments about NATO, referring to them as a \"very, very nasty statement.\" Trump said, \"Nobody needs NATO more than France,\" alluding to France being invaded twice during both World Wars. He also said, \"It\u2019s a very dangerous statement to make.\"\n\nMacron's remarks came weeks after Turkey, a member of NATO, invaded northern Syria. In an interview with The Economist magazine, Macron had said, \"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO.\" He added, \"So as soon as you have a member who feels they have a right to head off on their own, granted by the United States of America, they do it.\"\n\nDespite the tense exchanges, the two leaders were more conciliatory on Tuesday, with Macron repeatedly saying they \"agree\" on Trump's quest to get countries to stump up more in defense spending. Trump has been pushing for NATO members to meet their defense spending commitments, which include spending at least 2 percent of their own gross domestic product (GDP) in the bloc's defense.\n\nThe push appears to be working, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg telling Congress earlier this year that it had a \"real impact\" and that allies are now adding billions, with European allies and Canada expected to have spent an additional $100 billion by the end of next year.\n\nAnother issue between the two countries is Macron's recent decision to impose a French digital services tax on American companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter. The White House this week announced that the tax, which it claims \"discriminates\" against U.S. companies, will be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion worth of French products such as cheese, yogurt, sparkling wine, and makeup. Trump has criticized the tax, saying, \"I\u2019m not so in love with Facebook, Google, or Twitter \u2014 well, I do well on Twitter from the other side \u2014 but I don\u2019t want France taxing American companies.\"\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Macron comes as Trump is set to meet with NATO members during a two-day summit in London. Trump would not confirm if he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Turkish media in late November quoted Erdo\u011fan's adviser saying the country was considering dropping out of NATO.",
    " Title: U.S. Withdrawal from WHO and Impact on Second Pandemic Response\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) has raised concerns about the nation's preparedness for a potential second pandemic. The move, which is yet to be fully implemented, has been criticized for its potential to weaken international cooperation and undermine global health institutions at a time when they are most needed.\n\nExperts warn that the U.S.'s withdrawal could lead to a disengagement of U.S. officials and experts from international institutions, potentially encouraging other nations to follow suit. This could harm the WHO and further diminish America's already damaged international standing. A country that has struggled to manage its own outbreak, purchased critical drugs in large quantities, and withdrawn from global alliances may not receive timely warnings or support in the event of a new crisis.\n\nHowever, there is an optimistic scenario for a second virus outbreak. If the new pathogen is rapidly detected and contained, it could be less likely to spread due to the heightened vigilance of global citizens. The same tests used for COVID-19 diagnosis could potentially be adapted to detect the new pathogen. One company is already developing a fast \"multiplex\" test that could test for four respiratory viruses, including the new coronavirus, in a single nasal swab.\n\nThe existence of a seasonal flu vaccine offers an invaluable head start in the development of a vaccine for a new respiratory virus. If the new pathogen is a flu strain, existing vaccines could be tweaked to protect against it, although this would still take several months.\n\nThe success of countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany in controlling COVID-19 offers a model for a swift and effective response to a second pandemic. However, in nations like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which are currently struggling with COVID-19, a second respiratory virus could go unnoticed due to the resources diverted to combat the ongoing pandemic. The U.S., in particular, has been criticized for its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its resources for detecting and responding to new viruses have been stretched thin.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S.'s withdrawal from the WHO and its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns about the nation's ability to respond to a second respiratory virus outbreak. The optimistic scenario of a swift and effective response relies on global vigilance, rapid detection, and the adaptation of existing resources. However, in nations struggling with the ongoing pandemic, a second respiratory virus could go unnoticed and spread unchecked.",
    " Title: The Decline of San Francisco: A City Transformed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the vibrant city it once was, San Francisco, known for its breathtaking views, delectable cuisine, and cool jazz, now finds itself grappling with an army of homeless individuals, turning the once captivating city into a scene reminiscent of some of America's dirtiest slums.\n\nThis transformation was evident during a recent visit, a stark contrast to the first visit in 1964, when the city was freely roamed by members of Barry Goldwater's political team. Then, the city's streets and hills were a playground, now they are navigated with caution to avoid human feces. Then, Goldwater Girls in their white cowboy hats and boots welcomed delegates and guests at the Cow Palace. Today, homeless men openly urinate in Union Square.\n\nThe city's narrative has shifted dramatically, with the legalization of marijuana and the cultivation of more weed than oranges. The question on many minds is, what has happened? Why is America seemingly slouching towards a state of disarray, with the common rules of a civil society seemingly disregarded?\n\nOne contributing factor is the influence of political philosophers such as John Rawls, who argues that everything is relative and there is no absolute right or wrong. This philosophy, popular among liberals, posits that the purpose of government is to rectify every injustice, a stark contrast to the Founding Fathers' system of checks and balances designed to limit government intervention.\n\nThe government Rawls envisions, according to politics professor Jerome Foss, is empowered to enforce a theory without any institutional restraints. This, Foss argues, is a departure from the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which rely on self-evident truths accumulated through 2,500 years of Western civilization.\n\nAs a stranger in a strange land, the author watched the people tread the sidewalks carefully on their way to work, shrug in embarrassment about the feces and the needles, and the homeless tents that sprout like weeds. The author reflected on what the plain-speaking Barry Goldwater might say about the tragic decline of this once magical city, and believes it would be something like: \"Let's cut out the crap and clean it up!\"\n\nDespite the depressing scene in San Francisco, the author's spirits soared upon visiting Dallas, a city that shone with its shining skyscrapers, clean streets, and parks, and optimistic residents. The young professionals the author met were excited about what tomorrow might bring. Dallas, not San Francisco, is the future, unless the citizens of Baghdad-by-the-bay resolve to take back their city.\n\nLee Edwards, the Distinguished Fellow in Conservative Thought in the B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics at The Heritage Foundation, penned this article.",
    " Title: Indiana University Study Suggests Moral Disapproval as Primary Motivation for Same-sex Marriage Bans\n\nArticle:\n\nIndiana University sociologist Brian Powell's recent research published in the sociological journal Social Currents indicates that moral disapproval, rather than public policy considerations, is the primary motivation for bans on same-sex marriage. The study, which surveyed hundreds of people across the nation, found that the majority of opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in religious beliefs.\n\nOne response that reflected the majority of opposition was, \"Because I don't believe God intended them to be that way.\" Powell acknowledges that people have a right to their beliefs and values, but he suggests that if public opinion drives public policy, the real motivation for banning same-sex marriage is moral disapproval over homosexuality.\n\nThis finding could present a challenge for supporters of traditional marriage, as moral disapproval does not make a valid legal case. In fact, same-sex marriage proponents argue that such a case would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe longstanding courtroom debate over same-sex marriage has begun to address a particular legal term: \"animus.\" Animus is the notion that a law has no compelling public interest and is driven merely by a moral disapproval so strong that it causes harm to a group that's viewed as inferior. In the case of same-sex marriage, proponents argue that harm is denying gays and lesbians the basic right to marry.\n\nIU law professor Steve Sanders, who is co-counsel on an amicus brief from the Human Rights Campaign, claims that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional because they're based on animus. The brief will be filed in the Supreme Court same-sex marriage case, which is poised to become the definitive ruling on the issue.\n\nHowever, those fighting same-sex marriage adamantly disagree that their stance is fueled by animus. Such an argument, they say, places blame on every person who supported same-sex marriage bans as having evil intent.\n\nIf animus motivated Indiana's former same-sex marriage ban, said Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute, \"that means that the 150 legislators\u2014a majority of whom supported it\u2014and former Gov. Frank O'Bannon had to have hatred for gays in their hearts when they voted for and supported that bill. I just think that's a wrong analysis, but it's also a tremendous discredit to the men and women who serve in the legislature and our governor.\"\n\nInstead, he points to specific public policy considerations, such as the benefits of traditional marriages for couples, society, and children, and the argument that same-sex relationships do not bear out the same effects.\n\nHowever, proponents of same-sex marriage argue that the public policy arguments are flimsy, at best. For example, one such public policy argument is that marriage promotes \"responsible procreation\" and thus limits the number of children born accidentally. But since same-sex couples cannot naturally reproduce, they were excluded from the definition of marriage.\n\nJudge Richard Posner addressed this in the recent 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals majority opinion that maintained same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional in states including Indiana and Wisconsin. Posner wrote that if responsible procreation were a real justification for banning same-sex marriages, the state also would not allow people who are infertile to marry. He added that the states failed to show a valid policy interest for discriminatory bans on same-sex marriage.\n\nSanders, the IU law professor, explained further: If states merely want to \"protect marriage\" by denying same-sex couples from wedding, then why also refuse to recognize gay marriages from other states, prohibit civil unions, and deny domestic partnership benefits?\n\n\"To do something like that,\" Sanders said, \"begins to feel like it's more motivated out of spite than any sort of sensible public policy.\"\n\nBut if that sounds like animus, not everyone\u2014or court decision\u2014concurs. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees states including Ohio, did not agree that animus existed in its evaluation of same-sex marriage bans. The court upheld such bans, a decision out of chorus with other circuits that propelled the issue to be heard this summer in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"For most people,\" read the 6th Circuit majority opinion authored by Judge Jeffrey Sutton, \"whether for or against the amendment, the truth of why they did what they did is assuredly complicated, making it impossible to pin down any one consideration, as opposed to a rough aggregation of factors, as motivating them.\"\n\nSutton also refused to impugn traditional marriage supporters for wanting to uphold what has been a longtime social norm that has only recently been thrown into flux. He accepted policy arguments for responsible procreation as a valid, rational basis for state bans while acknowledging flaws. And even if he did not find animus, he was careful to note that allowing same-sex marriage seemed inevitable.\n\nStill, he wrote that should be a decision left up not to the courts, but to the democracy\u2014 \"as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.\"\n\nPowell's sociology research notes that public opinion on same-sex marriage has been changing, and he gives a nod to some interesting questions that could tendril off the concept of animus as the debate moves forward. What happens to public opinion if same-sex couples gain more legal rights? Or, will it subside fears and animosity toward same-sex couples?",
    " Title: Norway's Paternity Leave Policy and Its Impact on Gender Wage Gap: A Potential Model for the U.S.?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the context of the United States observing Equal Pay Day, a significant discussion has arisen regarding the potential impact of supporting women at home on reducing the gender wage gap and boosting the economy. This conversation is drawing parallels to Norway's policy of mandatory paternity leave, which has been credited with shrinking the country's gender wage gap by more than half.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Norway introduced a groundbreaking policy in Europe, offering four weeks of mandatory paternity leave for its workers. This policy shift not only changed the country's cultural attitudes towards child-rearing, with fathers now taking several months off to care for their children becoming commonplace, but it also had an economic side effect. In 1991, working women in Norway made about 20 percent less than men, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). By 2010, this gap had narrowed to 8.3 percent.\n\nWhile holding up any policy from Norway as a universal solution for social issues in the U.S. is problematic due to differences in size, cultural attitudes, and government structure, the idea that supporting women at home is linked to supporting them in the workplace is gaining traction. Specifically, advocates for gender equality are making a case that increased investment in child care could help shrink the pay gap, with the added benefit of growing the economy.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, released earlier this month, access to affordable child care would help increase the participation of women in the labor force, thereby growing the economy by an estimated $210 billion each year. \"The gender wage gap is definitely driven in part by the wage penalty faced by women because they are more likely to have an extended period out of the workforce while caring for sick relatives,\" writes Josh Bivens, research and policy director of EPI, via email. \"By giving parents greater access to high-quality, affordable child care and early childhood education, you make it easier for those who want to work to participate in the labor force... This increases the size of the labor force, which in turn boosts GDP.\"\n\nSimilarly, a 2015 analysis of state child-care costs from the Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit business-led public policy organization, recommends expanding certain child-care credits for both workers and employers.\n\nEqual Pay Day in the United States is observed every year on the day that women catch up financially to the annual pay of their male counterparts. This year's observance falls on April 12, meaning it took American women one year and 103 days to earn what American men earned during 2015. The day received political attention, with President Obama dedicating a monument to women's equality and Hillary Clinton taking part in a panel on pay transparency.\n\nAccording to Census Bureau data, women in the American workforce make 79 cents for every dollar a white man makes, and it's worse for women of color (60 cents for black women; 55 cents for Latino women). This wage disparity costs American women a combined $500 billion annually, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Partnership for Women & Families. If this gap were eliminated, on average, \"a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately 83 more weeks of food for her family, seven more months of mortgage and utilities payments, 11 more months of rent, or nine more years of birth control,\" the report reads.\n\nThe wage disparity between men and women has barely changed over the past two decades, says National Partnership vice president Vicki Shabo. In 2006, women made 77 cents for every dollar earned by white males, she says. On family leave, at least, there has been small but promising movement on several fronts. A January poll found that 80 percent of likely voters, including 94 percent of Democrats, 80 percent of Independents, and 65 percent of Republicans characterized things like equal pay, paid time off, and affordable child care as \"good for our nation.\" The issue has become a talking point for presidential candidates and politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThree states, Rhode Island, California, and New York, as well as cities like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, have introduced their own paid-leave rules. Major tech companies, from Twitter to Netflix to Etsy, in recent months have been all but falling over themselves to introduce increasingly competitive and inclusive paid-leave allowances for employees.\n\nHowever, there are still obstacles. Just 13 percent of U.S. workers have access to any paid leave at all, and \"if you look at the states with the populations most in need, against those that have taken action, there's a pretty substantial mismatch,\" says Shabo. \"The states that need it are not inclined to make their own laws, and that's why federal action is needed.\"\n\nThings are more challenging on the child-care front. In 33 states, outside infant care costs more than in-state college tuition. Paying for care for two children costs more than rent in most of the country, and it's a cost that even the highly competitive tech industry has yet to address. However, Shabo says that while investments in these areas are important in addressing equality, there's a long-term benefit for businesses as well.\n\n\"It contributes to workplace retention and helps women stay employed,\" she says. \"Turnover is costly. Replacing a worker can be 200 percent of a salary.\"",
    " Title: Critics Accuse The New York Times of Hypocrisy Over Hiring of Sarah Jeong Amid Controversial Tweets\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, critics are accusing The New York Times of a \"hypocritical double standard\" following the newspaper's hiring of tech writer Sarah Jeong. The controversy stems from several derogatory tweets Jeong posted, primarily in 2014, that targeted white people.\n\nJeong's tweets, which included statements such as \"getting joy out of being cruel to old white men\" and using the \"CancelWhitePeople\" hashtag, were unearthed earlier this week after the Times announced Jeong would be joining the paper. The paper defended Jeong in a statement on Thursday, attributing her offensive comments to a \"young Asian woman\" imitating the rhetoric of her own online harassers.\n\nConservative columnist Daniella Greenbaum told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the issue at hand is not about whether Jeong's tweets were racist or not. Instead, Greenbaum argues that the hypocrisy is the real issue.\n\n\"Jeong claimed she was kidding. Good enough, I guess, although swap the word 'white' and insert black, Mexican, or Jewish in any of her tweets and I have a feeling we'd be having a very different conversation,\" Greenbaum said.\n\nGreenbaum, a young columnist who has garnered attention for her conservative views, resigned from her job as a columnist at Business Insider last month after the website removed an already-published piece defending Scarlett Johansson for playing a transgender man. Greenbaum noticed that many in the media industry have rushed to defend Jeong.\n\n\"The New York Times, and much of the media chose to believe that she was kidding, or to posit that even if she wasn't kidding, her misguided beliefs are not reason enough to fire her. In other words, they extended her a brand of courtesy never offered to people who are right of center,\" Greenbaum said. \"That's the issue here.\"\n\nHigh-powered liberal media members such as HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen and leadership at The Verge, where Jeong currently works, have defended her rhetoric. Greenbaum, who didn't receive overwhelming support during her own ordeal, noted this discrepancy in treatment.\n\n\"Let's see how Jeong reacts next time a conservative finds themselves in a similar situation. Something tells me she won't speak out on their behalf,\" Greenbaum said.\n\nMedia Research Center analyst Kristine Marsh wrote, \"The New York Times justified her racist tweets,\" and called the paper's statement laughable. Some social media users agreed and blasted the paper's decision on Twitter.\n\nThe New York Times doubled-down on Jeong's behalf in their statement announcing support for the tech writer. The newspaper stated: \"We hired Sarah Jeong because of the exceptional work she has done...her journalism and the fact that she is a young Asian woman have made her a subject of frequent online harassment. For a period of time she responded to that harassment by imitating the rhetoric of her harassers.\"",
    " Title: Romney Affirms Tax Payment of at Least 13 Percent in the Past Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has disclosed that he has paid a tax rate of at least 13 percent over the past ten years. The statement was made during a visit to South Carolina, where Romney was attending a fundraiser.\n\nRomney's statement comes amidst mounting pressure, primarily from Democrats but also from some Republicans, for him to release several years of his tax returns. He has already disclosed his 2010 tax returns, which showed an effective federal tax rate of 13.9 percent, and has promised to release his 2011 returns before the election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat, has previously claimed that Romney paid no taxes over the past decade, a charge that Romney has now refuted.\n\n\"I did go back and look at my taxes, and over the past 10 years, I never paid less than 13 percent,\" Romney said. \"I think the most recent year is 13.6 or something like that. So I paid taxes every single year. Harry Reid's charge is totally false,\" he added.\n\nIn response, Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith issued a statement, \"Since there is substantial reason to doubt his claims, we have a simple message for him: prove it. Given Mitt Romney's secrecy about his returns, he has forfeited the right to have us take him just at his word.\"\n\nRomney is under no legal obligation to release more tax records. However, his wealth (estimated by Forbes at $230 million), the campaign's emphasis on economic issues and tax rates, and recent political history suggest that the calls for Romney to release more tax records will persist.\n\nSince 1980, only one party nominee or presumptive nominee other than Romney has released fewer than six years of returns, according to PolitiFact. This was Republican John McCain, who released two years of returns in 2008.\n\n\"The fascination with taxes I paid I find to be very small-minded compared to the broad issues that we face,\" Romney said on Thursday.\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC, Romney's wife, Ann, also addressed the issue, stating, \"We have been very transparent to what's legally required of us.\" She further added, \"There's going to be no more tax releases given.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department's IRS Investigation Draws Criticism as Conservatives Call It a \"Sham\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department is facing mounting criticism from conservatives after officials announced that they have found no evidence to warrant criminal charges in the IRS targeting scandal. The FBI investigation into the IRS's targeting of Tea Party and other conservative groups is still ongoing, but criminal charges are not expected at this point.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, called the news \"absolutely outrageous.\" She questioned the motives of the administration and accused them of attempting to sweep the scandal under the rug.\n\n\"It only leads us to the point where we can make guesses about their motives,\" Martin said. \"Why are they protecting the IRS? Why aren't they getting to the bottom of it? If they do not truly do a real investigation of this, there are always going to be doubts, and it is not good for the trust between the governors and the governed.\"\n\nMartin believes the administration is attempting to cover up the scandal, and she accused them of wanting to silence conservative groups.\n\n\"They wanted to silence us, and they have done what they can to silence us,\" she said. \"We're not going away, but they've done everything they can to make it difficult for us, if not impossible at times, to exercise our First Amendment rights.\"\n\nThe complaints come after it was revealed that the woman leading the FBI probe is a President Obama donor. Republicans have urged the Justice Department to remove her from the case, but to no avail.\n\nThe developments have fueled claims that there has been a lack of accountability in the administration over the scandal. The toughest action President Obama took was last May, when he announced Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller resigned at the administration's request following revelations that the agency singled out conservative groups for additional scrutiny as they sought tax-exempt status. However, a source told Fox News at the time that Miller was set to resign the following month anyway. Other lower-level officials have faced discipline or left the administration, though the circumstances were unclear.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing Tea Party groups, called the investigation a \"sham.\"\n\n\"To reach a conclusion that no criminal charges will be filed against those responsible for this illegal targeting scheme without interviewing any of our clients -- the real victims in this ordeal -- is absolutely absurd,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, questioned how sources could be discussing the likelihood of criminal charges in the first place when the probe is not even finished.\n\n\"These are serious matters -- but to make this decision before the investigation is completed seems entirely out of order and inappropriate,\" he said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that criminal charges are unlikely, unless investigators discover evidence that dramatically changes their viewpoint. Sources separately told Fox News that the investigation is still ongoing, but that they've turned up no evidence yet to support criminal charges.",
    " Title: Hannity Accuses Clinton, Media of Conspiracy and Propaganda in Latest Show\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated discussion on his radio show Wednesday, conservative talk show host Sean Hannity accused Hillary Clinton and several media outlets of conspiracy and propaganda. Hannity claimed that recent revelations from WikiLeaks have confirmed long-held conspiracy theories about Clinton's campaign.\n\nHannity alleged that Clinton was aware of Saudi Arabia and Qatar funding ISIS, and that she had a dream of a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders. He also suggested that Clinton's campaign had plotted to infiltrate the Catholic Church and advance a progressive ideology, a move he compared to Soviet Union propaganda.\n\nHannity accused CNN, the New York Times, CNBC, and the Boston Globe of conspiring to release questions to Clinton ahead of time and posing as objective journalists while propagandizing the public. He described the media's actions as a \"mass media assault on your mind.\"\n\nHannity further claimed that Clinton's campaign had wanted to face Donald Trump in the general election and that the current polls are not accurate due to media coverage of the Access Hollywood tapes and the delayed release of the tapes by NBC. Hannity also cited 1200 WikiLeaks drops that have occurred in recent days, which he believes have not been adequately reflected in the polls.\n\nHannity concluded by stating that the media's actions are a \"media assault on your mind\" and that the public should be aware of the conspiracy and propaganda being perpetuated by these outlets. He also reiterated his belief that Trump can still win the election in 27 days.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Joe Biden Leading President Trump in Six Key Senate Battlegrounds, Highlights Support for Mail-In Voting\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by Hart Research Associates has revealed that former Vice President Joe Biden currently holds a 9-point lead over President Donald Trump in six states where Republican senators are facing challenging re-election battles this fall. The poll, which surveyed voters in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina, shows Biden at 50 percent and Trump at 41 percent.\n\nTrump won four of these states in 2016, with the exceptions of Maine and Colorado. The six states feature vulnerable GOP incumbents, including Sens. Martha McSally (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Susan Collins (Maine), Steve Daines (Mont.), and Thom Tillis (N.C.).\n\nThe poll also indicates that the Democratic challengers lead the Republican incumbents by a margin of 46 to 41 percent. Currently, Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, meaning Democrats need to flip four seats to regain a majority.\n\nThe survey was designed to gauge voter attitudes towards mail balloting during the coronavirus pandemic. The poll found broad support for voting by mail, with 85 percent of voters in the six battlegrounds expressing a preference for a mail option due to the pandemic.\n\nEighty-three percent of voters also supported congressional action to expand access to mail balloting, including 67 percent of Trump supporters. Near-universal support for mail balloting was found among Democrats, while 56 percent of voters who plan to support the GOP senator up for reelection said the incumbent should support a vote-by-mail option.\n\nIf the GOP senator opposed legislation to expand mail-in balloting, 62 percent of voters said they would view the decision unfavorably, and 90 percent said they believe the decision would have been driven by politics.\n\nFifty-nine percent of voters overall said they do not believe that mail-in balloting is subject to fraud or corruption. The Hart Research survey was conducted on behalf of the Democracy For All 2021 Action campaign. The survey of 805 likely voters in the six states has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.",
    " Title: \"Campus Conservatives Face Harassment and Intimidation: A Personal Account from UC Berkeley\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark departure from the traditional image of universities as bastions of intellectualism and free thought, a growing number of conservative students at UC Berkeley and other institutions of higher learning are facing harassment, intimidation, and even violence.\n\nOne such student, who wishes to remain anonymous, recounts their experiences at UC Berkeley, once home to the Free Speech Movement. The student, a member of the Berkeley College Republicans (BCR), has been harassed, stalked, chased, punched, and spat on during their time at the university. In early 2017, they were chased by a mob of masked, black-clad protesters, members of a fringe political faction known as \"Antifa\" (short for \"anti-fascist\").\n\nThe incident occurred during a planned talk by Milo Yiannopoulos, which administrators canceled for safety reasons. The protesters, who threw bricks at police officers, launched Molotov cocktails, set fires, beat innocent bystanders, and caused widespread destruction, were arrested only once. The student was 20 years old at the time, a junior, and a member of the BCR.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the student watched as well-regarded political figures criticized not the violent acts of Antifa, but the Berkeley College Republicans. Critics included Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, who was \"appalled\" not by the violence but by President Trump's threat to revoke federal funds from Berkeley. Former United States secretary of labor Robert Reich suggested that conservatives staged the violence to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding.\n\nThe UC Berkeley school paper, the Daily Californian, published five opinion pieces justifying the use of violence to shut down the event. One headline stated, \"Violence Helped Ensure Safety for Students.\" George Orwell would be proud of such a title.\n\nThe student's experiences are not isolated incidents. Members of the BCR have been viciously attacked, harassed, and had their contact information publicly divulged in \"doxing\" incidents. BCR is a perennial target for vandalism and graffiti, and not infrequently has its tabling events targeted for \"bum-rush\" attacks. The university's inaction has only emboldened agitators to escalate their harassment, free of any consequences.\n\nIn fact, on several occasions, the university has locked arms with these leftists and helped to shut down BCR events through bureaucratic maneuvering. In 2017, three of their speakers, including the one mentioned above, were canceled in this manner: Ann Coulter, David Horowitz, and Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nFinally, in late 2017, the BCR managed to host their first successful event in months, with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. But in order for him to speak safely, UC Berkeley police determined that the campus and adjacent roads had to be closed off. Several leftist protesters attempting to disrupt the event were arrested that night.\n\nAround the same time, the BCR took Berkeley to court. In their lawsuit, now backed by the Department of Justice, the judge agreed that Berkeley's speech policies were unconstitutional. But is there a way to fight for free speech on campus without filing lawsuits that eat up taxpayer money?\n\nState legislatures have been quick to pass free-speech legislation, but we need to find a solution to the problem that rests with ordinary citizens like you and me. That is why the student is encouraging all donors to major universities such as UC Berkeley to follow the lead of Dilbert creator and UC Berkeley alumnus Scott Adams and cease giving financial support to universities that do not respect free expression.\n\nThe anti-free-speech philosophy that is roiling UCB does not come from nowhere. It lies at the very heart of the modern university and is taught every day by professors at major American universities. Nor is Berkeley alone, although it may be one of the worst offenders. American universities receive millions in donations from parents and alumni each year, and these donations are a major portion of their financial support. If donors start to speak, then universities will notice. And if there is anything that should be able to unite Americans of all political stripes, it is support for the great freedoms laid out in our First Amendment.\n\nShould these trends continue, universities will transform into violent echo chambers where intellectualism expires and Marxist dogma goes unchallenged. Gone are the days where students challenged mainstream ideas in the pursuit of truth. \"Ignorance is strength\" will be the new motto of American universities.",
    " Title: Republican Governors Seek Greater Autonomy in Medicaid Expansion through Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican governors are leveraging the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, to push for changes in Medicaid that they have long advocated for. This shift comes as a wave of anti-Obamacare governors, including John Kasich of Ohio, Rick Scott of Florida, and Chris Christie of New Jersey, are looking to accept federal funds to expand Medicaid on their terms.\n\nThese governors aim to use the billions of federal dollars allocated for Medicaid expansion to purchase private health insurance plans for the low-income population, rather than enrolling them in the traditional Medicaid system. This approach is still subject to negotiation and boundary-setting with the Department of Health and Human Services, but talks continue, and both sides are hopeful for a breakthrough on the \"private option.\"\n\nDennis Smith, a conservative health care consultant who has worked on Medicaid for President George W. Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and The Heritage Foundation, commented, \"Governors are under tremendous pressure to expand [Medicaid], and I think a lot of them were willing to listen. I think all the governors are going to work in the best interest of their states. They\u2019re saying, \u2018How can we do it our way that makes the most sense for us?\u2019\"\n\nThe shift in stance is evident in states like Pennsylvania, where Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, a longtime Obamacare critic, recently met with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to broker a deal amid increasing bipartisan pressure at home to expand Medicaid. This move follows a string of high-profile Republican defections on expansion, as well as more nuanced recent moves by states including Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas to provide private health insurance coverage using Medicaid expansion dollars.\n\nArkansas's proposal, tentatively endorsed by HHS, to do the full Medicaid expansion but via private health insurers in the Obamacare exchanges, has encouraged other states to come forth with similar notions. Among them are Republican governors in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Nebraska.\n\nThe outcome remains uncertain, as these governors may not get the flexibility they seek, and there's no way to know whether they'd then reluctantly push ahead with expansion or sit it out. However, the fact that these governors are even considering expansion marks a significant shift in the political landscape.",
    " Title: Clinton and Warren Take Aim at Sanders Amidst Democratic Party Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has criticized her 2016 rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, for his leadership style, campaign culture, and alleged misogyny. Clinton's comments come as Sanders is currently leading in several primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.\n\nClinton, who has left open the possibility of not supporting Sanders if he becomes the Democratic nominee, also took aim at Sanders' supporters, stating, \"It's not only him. It's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women.\"\n\nSanders' alleged sexism has been a topic of discussion in the Democratic primary race, with Senator Elizabeth Warren confronting him during the last debate over his past comments about a woman's ability to win the presidency. Warren stated, \"I think you just called me a liar on national TV,\" to which Sanders responded by accusing Warren of lying.\n\nClinton's criticism of Sanders and his supporters has been described as a \"pattern\" by some, as Sanders had previously stated in 2016 that Clinton was not qualified to be president. Obama strategist David Axelrod described Clinton as \"hellbent on stopping Sanders.\"\n\nThe acrimony between Sanders and two leading women in the Democratic Party has been compared to the battle between Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater in 1964, which did not end well for the Republican Party. It remains to be seen how this internal conflict within the Democratic Party will play out in the upcoming primaries and general election.\n\nAs the Democratic primary race heats up, the focus is shifting towards the eventual nominee who will face off against President Donald Trump in the general election. The Democratic Party is a coalition of various groups, and the rival claims of these constituent elements are becoming more prominent. The lack of diversity among the candidates on stage in the last debate has sparked concerns about the party's ability to appeal to minority voters, who are a crucial part of the Democratic electorate.\n\nPatrick Buchanan, an adviser to three presidents and a two-time Republican presidential candidate, has weighed in on the Democratic primary race, stating that the eventual nominee will need to unify the party and appeal to a diverse coalition of voters in order to defeat Trump in the general election. Buchanan's latest book is \"The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Acknowledges Cash Payment to Iran as Leverage for Prisoner Release, Sparking Ransom Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Obama administration has admitted for the first time that a $400 million cash payment made to Iran in January was used as leverage to secure the release of American prisoners. This revelation has fueled criticism that the transaction amounts to the U.S. paying ransom.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed that the U.S. withheld possession of the cash until a plane carrying the freed Americans had taken off from Tehran. During a State Department news briefing, Mr. Kirby stated, \"If you're asking me was there a connection in that regard, at the endgame, I'm not going to deny that.\" He further added, \"We took advantage of leverage that we felt we could have to make sure that they got out safely and efficiently.\"\n\nThe admission follows a report in The Wall Street Journal that an Iranian cargo plane was not allowed by the U.S. to leave Geneva with $400 million in euros, Swiss francs, and other currencies stacked on shipping pallets until the Americans had left Tehran. The exchange took place on Jan. 17.\n\nAdministration officials, including President Barack Obama, have maintained that the cash payment was not ransom because the $400 million was money the U.S. already owed Iran to settle a failed arms deal from more than three decades ago.\n\nHowever, the handling of the payment and the timing of the Americans' release have drawn criticism from Republicans. U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said Mr. Kirby's statements on Thursday showed the cash transfer to Iran was a ransom payment. \"If it quacks like a duck, it's a duck,\" Mr. Sasse said. \"If a cash payment is contingent on a hostage release, it's a ransom. The truth matters, and the president owes the American people an explanation.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) also expressed concern, stating that the latest reports about the cash payment sent a message to extremists that \"the United States will pay cold, hard cash for hostages.\"\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress have announced plans to hold hearings on the cash transfer in September. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday in a statement, \"The president owes the American people a full accounting of his actions and the dangerous precedent he has set.\"\n\nMr. Kirby reiterated that the payment did not amount to ransom. \"We don't pay ransom,\" he said. Instead, he portrayed the cash as a useful tool, stating, \"It would have been foolish, imprudent, irresponsible for us not to try to maintain maximum leverage.\"\n\nU.S. officials also have said that the prisoner release and the arms-deal settlement were negotiated through separate diplomatic channels, and denied that the two were linked. The White House announced in January that the U.S. would pay Iran $400 million in the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the U.S. and Iran reached to resolve a legal dispute over the failed arms deal. Administration officials did not disclose at the time that the $400 million had already been paid in cash to Iran and refused to answer questions about how and when the payment took place. The administration stated that the legal dispute could have cost the U.S. some $10 billion without January's settlement.",

Elleithee tweeted on Wednesday, \"You know who else believes white supremacy is not a real problem? White supremacists.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported that white supremacist murders in the US more than doubled in 2017, with far-right extremist groups and white supremacists responsible for 59% of all extremist-related fatalities in the US in 2017. They were responsible for 20% of these fatalities the year before.\n\nFar-right extremists are also responsible for most of the ideological killings in America in the last 10 years, according to data from the ADL. The exact numbers of groups, attacks, and activities are not as specifically known due to a lack of cohesiveness, transparency, and data surrounding these types of groups at a federal level.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray warned in July that domestic terrorism threats are on the rise. He stated that the FBI takes white supremacist hate crimes \"extremely seriously.\"\n\nTucker Carlson's punditry on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" frequently focuses on immigration and depicts immigrants as dangerous criminals. He rejects multiculturalism and relays to his audience that it is a threat to \"Western civilization.\"\n\nThe exact numbers of groups, attacks, and activities are not as specifically known because of a lack of cohesiveness, transparency, and data surrounding these types of groups at a federal level.\n\nIn the wake of the El Paso massacre, the issue of white supremacy is getting renewed attention. The Los Angeles Times has an editorial in Wednesday's paper titled, \"As the El Paso massacre showed once again, white supremacy is the poison in our well.\"\n\nAt the same time, over on MSNBC, host Chris Hayes suggested there is \"no distance\" between the anti-immigration rhetoric published in the El Paso shooter's racist manifesto and commentary uttered by Fox News opinion hosts like Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Brian Kilmeade.\n\nIt is important to note that the Dayton shooter's extreme left-wing views have also come under scrutiny, but there is no evidence so far that his politics were a factor in his actions. This is a crucial distinction.",
    " Title: Tensions Escalate as Gowdy Grills Rosenstein on Ongoing Russia Probe, Clinton Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated hearing on Thursday, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina took Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to task over the long-running Russia collusion probe, urging him to \"finish it the hell up\" as the country is being torn apart. The hearing, which took place before the House Judiciary Committee, saw a series of tense exchanges between Republicans and the Department of Justice (DOJ) over the handling of the Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\nThe hearing came amid a string of contentious moments, with the House approving a resolution insisting the DOJ comply with congressional subpoenas for documents related to the Russia case. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, in particular, challenged Rosenstein over his compliance during the hearing.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Gowdy expressed frustration over the protracted Russia investigation, suggesting that despite a host of charges against Trump-tied figures, the investigation has not found evidence of presidential wrongdoing. \"We've seen the bias, we need to see the evidence,\" Gowdy said. \"If you have evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the Trump campaign, present it to the damn grand jury. If you have evidence that this president acted inappropriately, present it to the American people.\"\n\nRosenstein, who oversees the special counsel's Russia probe, sought to defuse tensions, vowing to hold wrongdoers accountable in the wake of the inspector general report and defending the response to congressional requests for documents related to the Russia investigation. \"As with most things in Washington, the real work is not done on television and it is not all done by me,\" Rosenstein said. \"Trump administration officials are meeting and talking to your staffs every day to accommodate requests and produce relevant information to this committee, other committees, and several Senate committees.\"\n\nRosenstein was grilled repeatedly over his department's role in Trump campaign surveillance, alleged stonewalling of congressional document requests, and the damning watchdog report on FBI conduct during the Clinton email probe. He denied allegations from Jordan that he had FBI agent Peter Strzok avoid answering certain questions during a closed-door appearance before the committee a day earlier.\n\nFurther, he said he could not discuss classified information in an open setting when asked what the DOJ and FBI did to surveil the Trump campaign, including the reported work of an informant apparently in contact with members of that campaign in 2016. Rosenstein also rebuffed GOP suggestions that he recuse himself from the Russia probe and declined to comment about his role in approving a surveillance application for a Trump adviser.\n\nRosenstein, meanwhile, discussed the DOJ inspector general findings on the Clinton email case, saying \"today is not a happy occasion.\" He said it showed some FBI officials \"deviated from important principles.\"\n\nRosenstein said that the Justice Department has already implemented \"mandatory annual training\" to address the concerns. The hearing, which also featured FBI Director Christopher Wray, is part of a months-long battle between Republicans and the DOJ over the handling of the Russia probe and the Clinton email investigation. Democrats have pushed back against the requests for documents, with Democratic leaders expressing concern that the agencies are stonewalling congressional committees' requests for documents related to the beginning of the Russia investigation.",
    " Title: House Republicans Unveil Debt Ceiling Bill, Including Obamacare Delay and GOP Priorities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could escalate the ongoing political standoff between the White House and Congress, House Republicans have unveiled a debt ceiling bill that includes a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as well as a list of other Republican priorities on entitlements, taxes, energy, and jobs.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to be a central point of contention in the upcoming debt ceiling negotiations, aims to keep the Republican party united in their opposition to Obamacare and other contentious issues. The strategy, according to House Speaker John Boehner and other top leaders, is to focus on the debt ceiling fight and maintain a unified front.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would also include provisions for major tax reforms, changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, approval of the Keystone pipeline, and more offshore energy production. The measure would also include the approval of the Keystone pipeline and more offshore energy production, policies that are expected to boost job creation, according to GOP members.\n\nIn addition, the bill would include several provisions to roll back regulations on coal plants and other industries, bills that have previously passed in the House but failed to move in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Senate Democrats have stated they will not negotiate on a measure to authorize additional borrowing authority for the Treasury Department, which is projected to run out sometime in October or early November. They argue that Congress should not risk the nation's credit limit with another down-to-the-wire brawl over major policy issues like health care and taxes.\n\nThe White House and Senate Democrats have expressed their opposition to delaying Obamacare for a year and rolling back Obama administration regulations, making it unlikely that the bill will pass without significant changes. The strategy to pile on the debt ceiling bill with major policy items is designed to keep the Republican party unified, but it could also lead to a prolonged partisan fight that could impact financial markets.\n\nThe move comes after a rough week for the GOP, marked by messy infighting about strategy to deal with the government funding bill. The goal now is to keep the party on the same page and avoid another internal fight. The debt ceiling fight is expected to be a significant test of the Republican party's ability to work together and pass legislation in the face of opposition from the White House and Senate Democrats.",
    " Title: Michigan Poll Shows Democratic Frontrunners Biden and Sanders Leading Trump in Key 2020 Battleground State\n\nIn a recent poll of Michigan voters, two Democratic presidential candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, have taken the lead over incumbent President Donald Trump, potentially signaling a challenging path for Trump's reelection bid.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Lansing, Michigan-based Glengariff Group, found both Biden and Sanders leading Trump by 12 percentage points if the election were held today. The survey of 600 Michigan voters, which has a margin of error of 4 percentage points, was published by The Detroit News and local news station WDIV-TV.\n\nThe results of the poll indicate that only 36% of likely voters in Michigan would vote for Trump. Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican as president since 1988, surprised political observers in 2016 by backing Trump and helping him secure the White House. Winning Michigan, along with the states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which have similar voting patterns, would be crucial to Trump's reelection path.\n\nThe poll also compared Trump against three other Democratic presidential hopefuls: South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. All three candidates also outperformed Trump in the poll, although by smaller margins than Sanders and Biden.\n\nTrump's campaign has acknowledged the warning signs in Michigan and other key battleground states, which have significant manufacturing and agriculture sectors that have been affected by the president's trade wars. As the Democratic primary field is still in the process of sorting through more than 20 candidates, Republicans are optimistic they have time to invest in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and ultimately gain an advantage.\n\nThe poll results come on the heels of a Quinnipiac University poll of Pennsylvania conducted in early May, which found Biden leading Trump by 11 percentage points. As the general election approaches, both parties will focus on these critical states and work to secure the votes necessary to win the presidency.",
    " Title: Trump's Visit to Mississippi Civil Rights Museum Met with Protests from African-American Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Mississippi on Saturday to attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum was marked by the absence of top African-American leaders who chose to boycott the event in protest of the President's policies and record on race relations.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump toured the museum and delivered brief remarks, paying tribute to African-Americans who fought against institutionalized racism, including Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in Jackson in 1963.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Trump expressed his desire for the country to be a place where every child, regardless of their background, can grow up free from fear, devoid of hatred, and surrounded by love, opportunity, and hope.\n\nReferring to Evers and other civil rights leaders featured in the museum, Trump said, \"Today we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. We pray for inspiration from their example.\" Trump acknowledged Evers' wife Myrlie and brother Charles in the audience.\n\nU.S. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, announced on Thursday that he would not attend the museum opening due to Trump's presence.\n\n\"President Trump's attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,\" Lewis said in a joint statement with Mississippi Democratic U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, who also declined to attend.\n\nThe two men also cited Trump's \"disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants, and National Football League players\" and stated that the President had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in Mississippi.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also expressed disapproval of Trump's attendance. However, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who is black and ran against Trump in the early 2016 Republican presidential primaries before dropping out, accompanied the President on his tour of the museum.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has had a complex relationship with race relations. He was a leading proponent of the false theory that Democratic President Barack Obama, the first black U.S. President, was not born in the United States. Obama was born in Hawaii, a U.S. state.\n\nIn August, Trump sparked a wave of criticism, including from Republicans and a top adviser in his administration, for stating that both left- and right-wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman died.\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said on Friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance, hatred, and bigotry, and that Trump intended to honor the leaders of that struggle.\n\nThe White House described the decision by Lewis and Thompson not to attend as \"unfortunate.\" Trump concluded his remarks by saying, \"Today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice, and peace.\"",
    " Title: Nationwide School Walkout Against Gun Violence Commemorates Columbine Anniversary\n\nArticle:\n\nSchoolchildren across the United States walked out of their classrooms on Friday morning in a demonstration against gun violence, marking the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado. The National School Walkout, organized by high school student Lane Murdock in the wake of the Parkland shooting in Florida, involved over 2,000 schools.\n\nThe events took a somber turn when, only one hour before the walkout was due to begin, a student at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida, was shot in the ankle. A suspect is in custody, and only one person, a 17-year-old student, was injured. The suspect was not a current student at the school.\n\nStudents at Forest High School, which had planned an in-school \"civic demonstration\" rather than a walkout, were taken to a nearby church to meet their parents. Around 11:00 local time, officers responded to reports of a gunman at another school in Marion County, but later said those reports were false. All schools in the district were placed on \"Code Red\" lockdown as a precaution.\n\nThe goal of Friday's demonstration was to raise awareness of gun violence and to combat political inaction. Student Lane Murdock launched the National School Walkout campaign in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting in Florida. The protest started as a petition on the website change.org, with more than 250,000 people signing it.\n\nParticipants held 13 seconds of silence in honor of the 13 victims of the Columbine shooting. The sample walkout agenda from the campaign states that students will not return to school but instead will \"make calls to their Senators' offices and flood social media with calls for reform.\"\n\nUS students staged a national walkout on 14 March, one month after 17 people were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. One student in North Carolina, who was the lone protester in March, posted a selfie outside his school with dozens of classmates on Friday.\n\nThe Columbine shooting occurred on 20 April 1999, when two teenage students murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher. They also used nearly 100 explosive devices, including a bomb placed in the school's cafeteria that did not detonate. The shooting caused a national outcry, leading to changes in police tactics and investigations into violent video games and bullying.\n\nActors Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore penned absence letters for students to explain why they were participating. Students who survived the Florida shooting have been actively advocating for an end to gun violence, with many backing legislative changes to control the sale of guns.\n\nOn Thursday, students from the Colorado school district where Columbine High School is located held a \"Vote for Our Lives\" rally adjacent to the scene of the massacre. About 60 students from Parkland, Florida, attended, as well as students who survived a 2013 shooting at nearby Arapahoe High School.",
    " Title: North Korea Executes Former Second-in-Command Jang Song Thaek, Allegations of Corruption and Moral Turpitude\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea's state media announced on Friday that former Vice Marshal Jang Song Thaek, a close confidant and mentor to leader Kim Jong Un, has been executed. The announcement comes after Pyongyang accused Jang of corruption, drug use, gambling, womanizing, and leading a \"dissolute and depraved life.\"\n\nJang, who was considered the second most powerful official in the North, was instrumental in helping Kim Jong Un consolidate power following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. Jang's execution marks the latest and most significant in a series of personnel reshuffles that Kim has undertaken in an apparent bid to bolster his power.\n\nReports of Jang's aide seeking asylum in South Korea emerged earlier this week, with the unidentified aide being protected by South Korean officials in a secret location in China, according to cable news network YTN and the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper.\n\nJang was removed from all his posts and expelled from the ruling Workers' Party during a meeting of its politburo on Sunday, the North's official KCNA news agency said. Kim Jong Un attended and \"guided\" the meeting, it said. North Korean state television showed a still photograph of Jang being hauled away by uniformed guards from a large conference hall as it reported on the politburo meeting.\n\nKim's uncle has also been airbrushed out of pictures and video footage, and experts said his name was no longer searchable on the KCNA database. \"Jang and his followers committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they did tremendous harm to our party and revolution,\" KCNA said, without saying if Jang had been detained or charged with any crime.\n\nThe report did not refer to Jang's aide, whose defection, if confirmed, would be the most serious for North Korea in 15 years. The decision to remove Jang was widely reported in North Korea's media, including on the front page of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday, in contrast to the dismissal of officials in the past which were almost never reported.\n\nThe Rodong Sinmun carried a picture of what it said was the politburo meeting. Jang and Kim Kyong Hui, Jang's wife and aunt to the young leader, were among 17 politburo members. Neither could be seen in the photo. However, Kim's aunt, the daughter of the North's founding leader Kim Il Sung, was not in trouble, a source with close ties to Pyongyang told Reuters.\n\nLast week, a South Korean official said Jang was likely alive and in no immediate physical danger, as was his wife. South Korea's National Intelligence Service last week said it believed Jang had been relieved of his posts in November. It also said two of Jang's close associates were executed recently for corruption.\n\nPyongyang is undergoing its biggest leadership upheaval since the death in 2011 of former leader Kim Jong Il, the younger Kim's father. Among Jang's senior party and military posts, he was vice chairman of the country's top military body, the National Defense Commission. Jang had close ties to China and visited Beijing in 2012 on behalf of Kim. He was also head of the North Korean side of a joint project managing a special economic zone with Beijing.\n\nIn listing reasons why Jang was dismissed, KNCA said, \"Jang pretended to uphold the party and leader but was engrossed in such factional acts (such) as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double-dealing behind the scene.\" \"Affected by the capitalist way of living, Jang committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life,\" it added.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press and Reuters was used in this report.",
    " Title: North Korea's Kim Jong Un Affirms Nuclear Deterrent, Promotes Key Personnel Amidst Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nSEOUL, South Korea - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his country's nuclear weapons as a \"powerful deterrent\" that safeguards its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, following U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments suggesting a potential military response.\n\nIn a speech to the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party on Saturday, Kim addressed the \"complicated international situation.\" He stated that North Korea's nuclear weapons are a \"powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,\" in response to the \"protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.\"\n\nRecent weeks have seen North Korea launch two missiles over Japan and conduct its sixth nuclear test, with speculations that the country may be advancing rapidly towards its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. A Russian lawmaker, who recently returned from a visit to Pyongyang, stated on Friday that North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile.\n\nTrump has previously stated that the United States would \"totally destroy\" North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies. The situation, according to Kim Jong Un, validates North Korea's policy of \"byungjin,\" meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy, which he declared as \"absolutely right.\"\n\nKim also highlighted the growth of the national economy despite escalating sanctions, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program.\n\nThe meeting also saw personnel changes within North Korea's secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media reported. Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo, the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides. This promotion makes Kim Yo Jong, who is 28 years old, the only other millennial member of the influential body.\n\nMichael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University's 38 North website, stated, \"It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family's power.\"\n\nIn January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong, along with other North Korean officials, over \"severe human rights abuses.\" Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim's banned rocket program, were also promoted.\n\nState media announced that several other high-ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry described as an attempt by North Korea to navigate its increasing isolation.\n\n\"The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he's looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nNorth Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump \"President Evil\" in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to a full vote-carrying member of the politburo. Madden stated, \"Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea's top policy makers.\"\n\n\"Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri's interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,\" he added.",
    " Title: Trump Lowers Expectations Ahead of North Korea Summit as Negotiations Remain Stalled\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the highly anticipated second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un approaches, Trump is attempting to manage expectations, emphasizing the need for patience and a long-term approach to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe meeting, scheduled for February 27 in Vietnam, is aimed at striking a deal to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program, a goal that has proven elusive despite months of negotiations. The impasse between the two sides remains: the U.S. has demanded a detailed list of North Korea's nuclear inventory before sanctions are lifted, while North Korea insists on the lifting of sanctions before it provides the full list and begins to downgrade its nuclear capabilities.\n\nIn an effort to lower mounting pressure ahead of the historic meeting, Trump has made several public statements downplaying the urgency of the situation. On Tuesday, he told reporters in the Oval Office, \"We're in no rush whatsoever... As long as there's no testing, I'm in no rush.\" This comment, made before the summit, carries significant weight as it suggests a more measured approach to the negotiations.\n\nFrank Aum, a North Korea expert at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, noted that Trump's comments could be interpreted as an attempt to create negotiating leverage before the Hanoi summit. \"Trump is trying to create negotiating leverage before Hanoi by creating the impression that he is not desperate to achieve North Korea's denuclearization,\" Aum said.\n\nTrump's comments also come amidst a lull in North Korea's nuclear and missile testing, a fact that some experts argue is not a guarantee of a lasting peace. North Korea has completed six nuclear tests in total, only one of which took place during the Trump administration. There have also been years-long gaps between North Korea's missile tests, which began in the 1980s.\n\nBridget Coggins, a North Korea expert at the University of California Santa Barbara, told me that \"quick denuclearization is impractical.\" Coggins explained that Kim Jong Un believes that having a credible nuclear program will help his regime survive, mainly by deterring an invasion from the United States. Therefore, he currently has no incentive to give up his arsenal and open himself up to attack.\n\nThe way North Korea wants to proceed is via a step-by-step process, as evidenced by the four-part plan agreed upon during the first summit in Singapore. The plan includes establishing new US-North Korea relations, building a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, working toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\n\nHowever, there is major disagreement about what \"denuclearization\" means, with the U.S. defining it as the end of North Korea's nuclear program, and North Korea defining it as the end of U.S. protection of South Korea. The U.S. stations thousands of troops in South Korea and is willing to fight a nuclear war to help it, if needed.\n\nIt is possible that what Trump is trying to signal, albeit poorly, is that as long as North Korea does not test any more weapons, the U.S. will commit to working through the four-step plan. The next meeting may be more about relationship building than ending nuclear programs.\n\n\"There isn't trust between the two governments, and they're working to change the relationship,\" Coggins said. However, \"the pressure for real substantive progress is there too.\" The pressure for progress is a reminder that the stakes are high, and that the road to peace on the Korean Peninsula is long and arduous.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 326.15 points, or 1.3%, to close at 26,362.25, while the S&P 500 index rose 36.64 points, or 1.3%, to finish at 2,924.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 116.51 points, or 1.5%, to close at 7,973.39.\n\nThis week's rebound has significantly reduced month-to-date losses for the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow are now down 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq is off 2.5%. The S&P 500 and Dow are each less than 4% below all-time closing highs set in July, while the Nasdaq remains around 4.2% below its peak.\n\nThe positive market sentiment was sparked by a statement from a spokesman for China's commerce ministry, who indicated that China would not immediately respond to the latest round of tariff increases announced by President Donald Trump on Friday. The spokesman, Gao Feng, said, \"The question that should be discussed now is about removing the new tariffs to prevent escalation.\" He also mentioned that both sides were discussing a planned meeting next month of trade negotiators.\n\nInvestors also focused on a series of economic reports, including a revision of second-quarter GDP growth that showed the U.S. economy growing at a 2% annual rate rather than the previously reported 2.1%. The revised numbers also showed the U.S. consumer playing an even larger role in economic growth than before, as personal consumption accounted for 3.1 percentage points of growth, versus the initially reported 2.9.\n\nOther economic indicators, such as new applications for jobless benefits and pending home sales, also showed mixed results. New applications for jobless benefits rose by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 during the week ended Aug. 24, slightly above economist expectations of 214,000. Pending home sales fell by 2.5% in July, according to the National Association of Realtors, versus a decline of 0.3% expected by economists polled by \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nIn corporate news, shares of Best Buy Co. Inc. and Dollar Tree Inc. declined after their respective earnings reports, while shares of Dollar General Corp. and Tech Data Corp. rose following positive earnings reports.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 3.5 basis points to 1.5%, while the price of crude oil rose 1.3% to $56.52 per barrel. The price of gold ended the day 0.9% lower at $1,534.6 per ounce, and the value of the U.S. dollar ticked 0.3% higher.\n\nIn Asia, stocks traded mostly lower, with the China CSI 300 falling 0.3%, while the Nikkei 225 lost 0.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.3%, and European stocks rallied, with the Stoxx Europe 600 closing 1% higher.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Reach Agreement to Vote on Bipartisan Bills to End Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer have reached an agreement to vote on two bills aimed at ending the ongoing government shutdown. The Senate will vote on Thursday, with one bill being the immigration proposal President Donald Trump unveiled on Saturday, and the other being a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government until February 8, a bill that has already been passed by the House.\n\nThe clean continuing resolution, if passed, would ensure that federal workers would not miss another payday. This bill would require 60 votes to advance. The immigration bill, however, is a non-starter for Democrats, as it contains several controversial provisions that they find unacceptable.\n\nThis week's developments could mark the breakthrough that ends the shutdown, at least temporarily, or it could be another round of shutdown messaging. If enough Republicans join Democrats to pass the short-term bill, President Trump would receive a bill to fund the government without any wall money, which would be a significant defeat for him and a sign that Senate Republicans have decided their position is untenable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the president comes out against the proposal and manages to dissuade Senate Republicans from voting for it, the shutdown would continue. In this scenario, Senate Republican leaders could argue that it is futile to pass legislation that does not address the border.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, this week has seen movement in the Senate that was not evident in the past month of the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell requested the president to develop \"compromise\" legislation, as he needed something to present on the Senate floor. Additionally, centrist Democrats in the House, representing red or purple districts, have drafted a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her to at least promise the president a vote on his homeland security request, including border wall funding, after the government reopens.\n\nThe Senate may not be able to end the shutdown on Thursday. However, the machinery that will eventually end the shutdown\u2014pressure from anxious Senate Republicans and anxious House Democrats\u2014is now in motion.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski Confirms Presidential Interference in Russia Investigation in Tense Congressional Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated and contentious hearing on Tuesday, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski confirmed that President Donald Trump had asked him to intervene in the Russia investigation. The hearing, chaired by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler, ended with Nadler admonishing Lewandowski for his behavior, stating, \"It is a part of a pattern by a White House desperate not to reveal the truth.\"\n\nAs the Democrats began an \"aggressive series\" of impeachment hearings, Lewandowski, a close Trump ally, followed White House orders not to discuss conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. The report described possible obstructions of justice.\n\nLewandowski, who is considering running for the US Senate in New Hampshire, was defiant during the five-hour session. He demanded a copy of the Mueller report and read from it, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one. He also took the opportunity during a bathroom break to tweet a link to his new Super Pac.\n\nTrump supported Lewandowski during the hearing, tweeting that his opening statement was \"beautiful.\" Meanwhile, Republicans on the panel forced a series of procedural votes, causing the hearing to become disorganized.\n\nThe hearing highlighted a central dilemma for the Judiciary Committee all year as it investigates and potentially tries to impeach Trump. While many in the Democrats' base want them to move quickly to remove Trump from office, the White House has blocked the committee's oversight requests at almost every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow aides and associates to testify.\n\nLewandowski was a central figure in Mueller's report, which described two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to tell the former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curtail Mueller's investigation and fire Sessions if he refused to meet with Lewandowski. Lewandowski never delivered the message, instead delegating the task to the White House aide Rick Dearborn, who declined to comply, according to the report.\n\nPressed by a lawyer for the Democrats, Barry Berke, Lewandowski acknowledged he might have lied in a cable interview when he said he didn't remember the president asking him to get involved with Sessions. He added, \"I have no obligation to be honest with the media because they are just as dishonest as everybody else.\"\n\nTwo other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski, Dearborn and the former White House aide Rob Porter, did not show up, on orders from the White House, which holds that former aides are \"absolutely immune\" from testifying. Democrats are challenging that position in court.",

Traditional Seder meals, which usually gather extended families and friends, are being held in smaller, socially-distanced groups or virtually.\n\nSimilarly, Christians worldwide are adapting their Easter celebrations, with many churches opting for virtual services or drive-in services to maintain social distancing. In some countries, large gatherings are prohibited, leading to the cancellation of public processions and Easter egg hunts.\n\nDespite the challenges, faith leaders and communities are finding creative ways to maintain spiritual connections while adhering to public health guidelines. Online platforms are hosting virtual sermons, prayer sessions, and educational resources for those observing at home.\n\nThe adaptations during these holy days serve as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of religious communities in the face of adversity.

    " Title: Senate's Patriot Act Provisions Expire as Sen. Rand Paul Blocks Extension\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the federal government's controversial program of gathering Americans' phone records ceased operation at midnight on Sunday, marking a significant setback for the program's advocates, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul, who has made ending the data gathering program his signature issue.\n\nThe expiration of the provisions under the Patriot Act, though expected to be only temporary, is Sen. McConnell's first serious defeat as majority leader. The event underscores the challenges in maintaining unity among his own members, particularly when they are running for president, as is Sen. Paul.\n\nIn the early hours of May 24 and again in an unusual Senate session on Sunday, Sen. Paul employed parliamentary rules to obstruct floor action on the issue. A vote on the USA Freedom Act, a House compromise bill, is not expected until later this week. The House bill passed overwhelmingly and has President Obama's support. It shifts the job of data gathering to phone companies rather than the government, and requires the government to obtain a search warrant to access the data.\n\nSen. McConnell worked diligently to build opposition to the House bill, which he has criticized as an obstacle to intelligence gathering. However, he lost supporters as senators rallied around the House bill, 77 to 17, in a procedural vote to advance the bill on Sunday. The leader had aimed to simply extend the provisions of the Patriot Act, but Sen. Paul, eight days ago and on Sunday, blocked even short-term extensions.\n\nRepublicans attributed the expiration to Sen. Paul rather than the leader, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona stating, \"I'm sure we're not going to let the whole program lapse, but because Senator Paul is taking advantage of the rules of the Senate, [we] will delay, and there will be an interim period where the nation is less secure.\"\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, faulted McConnell, blaming him for a \"manufactured crisis\" by waiting to bring up the Patriot Act provisions until just before the Senate's Memorial Day recess\u2014a week before their expiration. When he was majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid also used deadlines to forge consensus. However, his spokesman, Adam Jentleson, stated that Reid \"would never have stacked this many bills together against a deadline without a clear path forward.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine expressed concern about the program's lapse at a time when the terrorist threat is high. \"Perhaps we should have stayed in last week rather than going on recess until the issue was resolved,\" she said.\n\nThe standoff between Sen. Paul and Sen. McConnell has left all parties concerned about the program's lapse, with Sen. Collins stating, \"all of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high and coming at us from so many different directions.\" The situation underscores the delicate balance between privacy and national security in the digital age.",
    " Title: \"India's Detention Centers for Undocumented Migrants Face Coronavirus Concerns as Families Worry for Loved Ones' Safety\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the northeastern state of Assam, India, families of more than 800 undocumented migrants being held indefinitely in six detention centers are expressing concerns about the safety of their loved ones amid the global coronavirus pandemic. One such family is that of Gulbahar Begum, a 28-year-old woman from Marigaon district, who has been waging a legal battle to free her 69-year-old father, Gul Mohammad, who has been declared an \"illegal immigrant\" by the Foreigners Tribunal and is currently detained in the Goalpara detention center.\n\nGul Mohammad, who hails from Barkhal village, was left off the National Register of Citizens (NRC) last year, effectively rendering him stateless. He faces either deportation or detention in camps such as the one in which he is currently detained. Gulbahar is particularly worried about her father's health, as he has various health issues, including a kidney ailment and a swollen left leg.\n\n\"My father has various health issues including a kidney ailment. His left leg often swells up,\" Gulbahar told a local news outlet. \"He should have been home in this public health crisis and not in a detention center.\"\n\nThe Goalpara detention center houses nearly 370 people declared as \"illegal immigrants.\" Botu Miya, a 40-year-old man from Cachar district, is distressed as he fears his wife, Banesa Begum, being held in Silchar detention center, might contract the coronavirus. Banesa, a 45-year-old daily wage laborer, was first marked as a \"doubtful voter\" for not producing the requisite proof of Indian citizenship and later labeled an undocumented migrant.\n\nDoubtful voters (or D-voters) is a category of voters in Assam whose voting rights were taken away by the government in 1997. Since then, nearly 143,000 people have been marked as D-voters and referred to Foreigners' Tribunals, facing charges of being \"undocumented\" migrants mainly from Bangladesh. Some of them are currently languishing in detention centers.\n\n\"The condition in the detention camps is inhumane and without basic facilities like bedding and toilets,\" Miya told a local news outlet. \"And keeping her in such a place amid this disease is dangerous.\"\n\nAuthorities, however, claim that all necessary measures are in place to ensure the safety of the inmates. Sonitpur district deputy commissioner, Manvendra Pratap Singh, told a local news outlet that they have stopped taking in new inmates, everyone is being screened by doctors on a regular basis, and there does not seem to be any such possibility of a coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHowever, families of the detainees are making desperate attempts to secure bail from the courts before the virus turns into a disaster inside the detention centers. Anura Begum, a 31-year-old woman from Gobradhana village in Baksa district, has collected all the documents, including the bond amount to bail out her husband Kadam Ali, lodged in the Goalpara center. But courts across the state suspended functioning last month following the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Just before the lockdown, I had submitted documents for his bail. The officials rejected them and asked me to furnish additional documents,\" Begum told a local news outlet. \"But now courts are closed, and I don't know what will happen to him.\"\n\nSimilarly, Hazrat Ali, a 22-year-old man from Shaatbhoridhuk village in Barpeta district, is also waiting for the courts to open so that he can get his father Hanif Ali out on bail.\n\n\"Each passing day brings new tragedy for us. All I want is him to be home,\" Ali told a local news outlet.\n\nHuman rights organizations have demanded the release of the detainees amid the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Amnesty International India, in a statement on Monday, called for the immediate release of inmates declared foreigners, stating that the detainees in overcrowded detention centers face a heightened risk of infection and must be protected starting with their immediate release.\n\nOn Tuesday, India's Supreme Court heard a petition filed by one of the detainees, Raju Bala Das, and issued notices to both the Assam and federal governments. Das's petition had sought the release of people who have spent more than two years in detention. The top court also heard pleas by the Justice and Liberty Initiative, a non-profit group, which called for their release on humanitarian grounds.\n\n\"The government has deported just five 'foreigners' in the last seven years. It is because of the fact that most of those in the camps are Indian citizens. They should be immediately released,\" the group's founder Aman Wadud told a local news outlet. \"And this is the best time to correct the historical mistake.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will next hear both the pleas on April 13. For Gulbahar, imprisonment amid the coronavirus pandemic is like a death sentence for her father. With each passing day, she says her hope of seeing him alive is fading. \"I think I would never see him alive,\" she said. \"And the government has to take responsibility for his death.\"",
    " Title: Trump Condemns Syrian Chemical Attack, Signals Potential U.S. Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in U.S. policy, President Donald Trump has condemned the chemical attack in Syria that has been attributed to President Bashar Assad, expressing strong criticism of the Syrian leader's actions but remaining vague on the U.S.'s response.\n\nDuring a press conference in the Rose Garden on Wednesday with Jordan's King Abdullah, Trump stated, \"It crossed a lot of lines for me.\" He continued, \"When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal that people were shocked to hear what gas it was, that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line, many, many lines.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Assad and the Syrian regime marks a departure from his previous stance, which was more hesitant about U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict. In the past, Trump had argued that the U.S. should not intervene in the conflict.\n\nHowever, Trump indicated that the recent chemical attack, which has resulted in at least 72 deaths, has had a significant impact on his views. \"It's very, very possible that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments on Wednesday were at odds with his previous criticisms of former President Barack Obama for not acting when Assad crossed the \"red line\" after chemical weapons were first used. Trump argued that the U.S. should not have been involved in the Middle East, citing the Iraq War as an example of a misstep by the Bush administration.\n\n\"I inherited a mess,\" Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Obama administration should have addressed the Syrian crisis earlier. \"And when he didn't cross that line in making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country.\"\n\nWhen asked about how the U.S. would respond, Trump was evasive, stating that he did not want to reveal his hand and would remain flexible. \"I now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly,\" Trump said.\n\nUnited Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also suggested the possibility of U.S. intervention in Syria's ongoing civil war, strongly condemning the attacks and blaming Russia for its support of the Assad regime. Haley questioned, \"How many more children have to die before Russia cares?\"\n\nTrump has historically praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a willingness to work with Russia to combat terrorism. However, in an interview with the New York Times before the press conference, Trump began to cast blame toward Putin, marking another shift in his stance. \"I think it's a very sad day for Russia because they're aligned, and in this case, all information points to Syria that they did this,\" Trump told the Times. \"Why they did this, who knows? That's a level, first of all, they were not supposed to have this.\"",
    " Title: Small Business Health Exchanges Face Challenges in Implementation of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is facing challenges in implementing the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges, a key component of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), as insurers show limited interest in participating. The SHOP exchanges, designed to make it easier for small businesses to purchase health coverage, are facing a potential lack of insurer participation, which could hinder competition and increase costs.\n\nAccording to a report by Politico, early looks at insurance offerings on the Obamacare exchanges show that insurers are not signing up in large numbers to sell on the SHOP exchanges. In some states, only one insurer has signed up for the SHOP exchanges, which are supposed to foster competition and make it easier for small businesses to purchase coverage.\n\nThe Obama administration is still trying to recruit insurers to states where there has been little interest in the exchanges. However, some health law advocates believe that the administration has put a greater emphasis on standing up the individual exchanges, where they hope premium tax credits will be a big draw for millions to sign up for coverage next year. In many cases, they also see little incentive for SHOP exchanges in 2014.\n\nA limited tax credit for small businesses available only in the SHOP exchanges has received less interest than expected, and a key feature providing employees with more freedom to pick their health plan has been delayed in most states. In Washington state and North Carolina, for instance, only a single insurer has signed up to offer insurance through the small-business exchanges, and in Mississippi, no insurers have signed up for the SHOP exchange.\n\nFurthermore, the delayed program that was supposed to help provide small-business employees with a greater array of choice in health plans isn't going to get out of the gate until after 2015 in the federally-run state exchanges. This delay will not help the Obama administration follow through on the key selling point that these exchanges would be helpful to small businesses in increasing competition and lowering costs.\n\nThe administration's focus on individual exchanges may have contributed to the lack of interest in the SHOP exchanges. The individual exchanges have received more attention in preparation for the health law's rollout, and the Obama administration is hoping that premium tax credits will be a significant draw for millions to sign up for coverage next year. However, the lack of insurer participation in the SHOP exchanges could make it difficult for small businesses to find affordable health coverage.\n\nThe challenges facing the SHOP exchanges could have significant implications for small businesses and the overall success of Obamacare. The administration will need to address these issues in order to ensure that small businesses have access to affordable health coverage and that the law is implemented successfully.",
    " Title: House Approves USA Freedom Act, Aimed at Reforming Bulk Data Collection Program\n\nArticle:\n\nThe USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan legislation aimed at reforming the bulk data collection program, has passed the House Judiciary Committee with overwhelming support from both parties and is expected to be approved by the full House. The bill, which faces a more uncertain future in the Senate, is poised to address the expiration of the current legal authority for domestic bulk data collection on June 1.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, has attracted support from some Republican votes due to its increased penalties for anyone convicted of material support for terrorism and its provision allowing intelligence agencies to track suspected terrorists for 72 hours after they enter the country without a warrant.\n\nThe bulk collection program, authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, has been a subject of intense criticism since Edward Snowden revealed its details in 2013. The National Security Agency (NSA) cast a wide net for call data by forcing major phone companies, under a secret court order, to provide their data directly to government computers. However, the data received was only \"metadata\" - phone numbers called, as well as the duration and time of calls, but not the content of the conversations.\n\nUnder the new legislation, the government would no longer be allowed to maintain a database of that information. Instead, the government would be limited to obtaining data from telecommunications companies only when there is a \"reasonable, articulable suspicion\" that a \"specific selection term\" used to request data is associated with international terrorism.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy group, the bill \"should end\" the bulk collection of \"everyone's phone records.\" However, the NSA could still search for records beyond telephone data with fewer restrictions. The bill would not address warrantless collection of Americans' international calls and emails under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments of 2008.\n\nThe future of the bulk collection program may have been sealed in December 2013, when a panel of experts appointed by President Obama found that the program had been of minimal intelligence value and ran considerable risks of invading privacy. The panel's report highlighted the need for reforms in the bulk data collection program. The USA Freedom Act represents a significant step towards such reforms.",
    " Title: Berlin Christmas Market Attack: A Tragic Strike on German Tradition and Sentiment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling turn of events, a suspected terrorist plowed a truck into a bustling Christmas market in Berlin Monday night, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals and injuring 48 others, some critically. The attack occurred at the heart of German tradition, the much-loved Christkindlmarkt, or Christmas market.\n\nThe Christmas market, often dismissed as kitschy or overly commercial, holds a profound influence over German sentiment. Twinkling white lights, a cappella music, and trimmed huts selling handcrafted wooden ornaments hark back to 1434, to Dresden's Striezelmarkt.\n\nIn 2015, while covering a Christmas market in Stuttgart, I had the chance to speak with Roland Schweizer, a burly man with a gap-toothed smile, selling iced gingerbread cookies and mounds of sugared almonds. As a boy, he helped his father at the same stand. \"Without the Christmas market, there is no Christmas,\" he told me, echoing the sentiments of many Germans. \"This is worth preserving.\"\n\nEarly Tuesday, Berlin police tweeted that the truck driver intentionally veered into the crowd, in what was likely a terrorist attack. The evening attack occurred at Breitscheidplatz, near the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church that lay in ruins after World War II.\n\nThe suspect, a man from Pakistan, entered Germany on December 31, 2015, and came to Berlin in February. It is possible he entered the country as part of the wave of over a million refugees and migrants seeking asylum in Europe. However, Berlin police say the suspect denies any role, and they urge Germans to remain vigilant as the perpetrator may still be at large.\n\nThis attack follows a series of turbulent events in Europe, including the terrorist attack in Nice, France, in July, where a man drove a 19-ton truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, resulting in 86 deaths. Germany had been spared such a mega attack, although four separate incidents this summer became known as \"black July.\"\n\nThe yearning for a calmer time is palpable, and the allure of the Christmas market reflects this longing. Stephen Nissenbaum, author of \"The Battle for Christmas,\" told me that this type of longing has always underpinned the \"Christmas spirit.\" People have always looked back at the magical hold Christmas had over them as children, or generally to a time they perceive as simpler.\n\nOne longtime producer of Christmas markets in Germany, reached by phone, was too shaken to speak. Hitting a Christmas market is powerfully symbolic for Germans, just as attacking Bastille Day festivities was for the French, or hitting cafes for Parisians, as terrorists did on November 13, 2015.\n\nTerrorists, although it has not been confirmed in this case who is behind the attack in Berlin, are not necessarily hitting these places as symbols of a nation. \"They want to kill as many people as they can. It is very logical that they would choose very crowded places when people are celebrating, like Bastille Day or Christmas, or it could be football or a rock concert,\" said Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard Huyghe, a senior researcher at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris.\n\nTerrorists have struck at religion in Europe, killing a priest in Normandy this summer and targeting a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015. An attack on Christmas is perceived not in overtly religious terms but as an attack on a way of life. Millions are drawn to Germany's markets each year \u2013 so popular they are now reproduced around Europe and even the United States.\n\nThe US State Department issued a warning in November that terrorists in Europe were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events, including outdoor markets.\" Last week, officials said a 12-year-old boy attempted to set off a bomb at another market in Ludwigshafen. Markets in Germany have been shut down for the day out of respect for the victims, but are expected to reopen for the rest of the season under much heavier security \u2013 in Germany, France, and beyond.",
    " Title: Trump Delays Decision on Firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions Until After Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump has delayed his decision on whether to dismiss Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a frequent target of his criticism, until at least after the November congressional elections.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News on Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his desire for Mr. Sessions to perform well in his role. \"I just would love to have him do a great job,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sessions. When asked whether he would keep Mr. Sessions on the job beyond November, Mr. Trump declined to comment.\n\nFor months, Mr. Trump has publicly criticized Mr. Sessions, and recently told a Republican lawmaker that he wanted to fire him before the midterm elections, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, top Republican lawmakers have urged Mr. Sessions to resist pressure to resign and have encouraged Mr. Trump to hold off on any decision for the time being.\n\nMr. Trump's statement on Mr. Sessions came after the president consulted advisers earlier this week about the potential political fallout from firing Mr. Sessions, telling one person that he didn't believe there would be significant backlash, according to a person familiar with the matter. Inside the White House, senior officials presented Mr. Trump with legal and political reasons for not removing Mr. Sessions, but those advisers were unsure earlier this week about Mr. Trump's ultimate decision.\n\nOne factor contributing to Mr. Trump's decision to keep Mr. Sessions for the coming months is the lack of a clear successor. White House officials and others Mr. Trump has spoken to about firing Mr. Sessions said the president has not inquired about potential successors, these people said.\n\nTensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions have escalated due to Mr. Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. This investigation is examining possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has labeled the probe a \"witch hunt.\" Russia has also denied any involvement.\n\nLast week, President Trump launched a series of attacks on Mr. Sessions, suggesting that Mr. Sessions is allowing the special counsel's Russia investigation to proceed while permitting \"real corruption\" to go \"untouched.\" In response, Mr. Sessions issued a rare public statement defending his leadership of the Justice Department. \"While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\" he said.\n\nMr. Sessions finds himself in a delicate position, as he must balance fending off attacks from Mr. Trump while implementing the president's tough-on-crime policies.",
    " Title: AP Photo of Mitt Romney Sparks Controversy Over Ethical Boundaries in Journalism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a photograph of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has sparked controversy over ethical boundaries in journalism. The image, published by The Associated Press (AP) on Monday, has since gone viral, with the candidate's debate performance taking a backseat as the photograph becomes the center of attention.\n\nThe photograph, which depicts Romney bending over with a seemingly astonished schoolgirl standing behind him, mouth agape, has been the subject of numerous jokes and criticisms. Tim Graham, media analysis director at the Media Research Center, commented, \"It's unbelievable. It honestly looks like a little girl is gaping at Romney from behind.\"\n\nSteve Manuel, senior lecturer at Penn State's College of Communications and an award-winning photojournalist, expressed his concern over the AP's decision to publish the image. \"In this photo, while it may appear funny, AP knows exactly what viewers are thinking,\" he wrote in an email. \"It's not legitimate news. AP knows that viewers are going to chuckle and imagine what the little girl is seeing, and it makes Gov. Romney appear a bit foolish. That is not the purpose or mission of photojournalism.\"\n\nStephen Ward, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted that the photo, in itself, was not too offensive but could be exploited. \"The AP may have entered a bit of a gray area with this one,\" he said. \"The photo was not altered or manipulated in any apparent way. But the National Press Photographers Association code of ethics offers some guidance.\"\n\nThe code of ethics states, \"Treat all subjects with respect and dignity\" and \"Be complete and provide context when photographing or recording subjects.\" Graham also pointed out that the image coincided with a story with a decidedly anti-Romney tone.\n\nThe AP piece that ran around the same time was about Romney's decision to skip a Nickelodeon-sponsored \"Kids Pick the President\" special, which President Obama had agreed to participate in. The story was, in large part, a venue for show producer Linda Ellerbee to express her disapproval of the Republican nominee. Ellerbee told the AP, \"That's several million kids who actually want to get involved in the democratic process. They don't deserve to be dissed.\"\n\nRomney's campaign claimed it did not have time, and it is important to note that kids do not actually vote. The controversy surrounding the photograph and the accompanying story has raised questions about the role of journalism in shaping public opinion and the ethical boundaries that should be adhered to in the pursuit of news.",
    " Title: Trump Dismisses Lack of Endorsements from Some Republican Leaders, Predicts Party Unity in the Fall\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews over the weekend, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump downplayed the refusal of some Republican leaders to endorse him, stating that most of the party will back his nomination, and new voters will compensate for the rest.\n\nDuring an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said, \"I'm going to get millions and millions of votes more than the Republicans would have gotten.\" He was addressing questions raised by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday.\n\nIn a separate interview on ABC's This Week, Trump described himself as a \"very different\" kind of candidate, suggesting that party unity may not be as crucial because of new Republicans. \"I think it would be better if it were unified,\" Trump said, adding, \"I do not think it actually has to be unified\" in the more traditional sense.\n\n\"It's not called the Conservative Party,\" he told ABC. \"This is called the Republican Party.\"\n\nRyan has expressed doubts about Trump's conservatism, while other party members, including 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, former 2016 GOP hopefuls Jeb Bush, and Lindsey Graham, have come out against the nominee-in-waiting. They have cited issues ranging from Trump's abrasive language to his comments about women and Hispanics.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Bush wrote that Trump lacks \"the temperament or strength of character\" to be president, adding that \"he has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative.\"\n\nRomney has denounced Trump as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud,\" while Graham, the South Carolina senator who, like Bush, lost to Trump in the Republican nomination fight, told CNN, \"Good luck with Paul Ryan trying to find a conservative agenda with this guy.\"\n\nIn his NBC interview, Trump called Romney \"ungrateful\" for his support in 2012 and said the former Massachusetts governor \"choked\" on his chance to beat President Obama. Trump also noted that both Bush and Graham once backed a pledge to support the nominee but are now breaking it.\n\n\"Now they're breaking,\" Trump said. \"You know, that's a question of honor.\"\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee said he was \"blindsided\" by Ryan's reluctance to endorse, saying he thought he had a good relationship with the House speaker. Ryan told CNN he wants to back the nominee, but \"I'm not there right now.\"\n\nDemocrats are capitalizing on the GOP infighting, particularly likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who is targeting anti-Trump Republicans for the fall general election. \"Obviously I'm reaching out to Democrats, Republicans, Independents \u2014 all voters who want a candidate who is running a campaign based on issues,\" Clinton told CBS' Face the Nation.\n\nTrump, saying he will beat \"Crooked Hillary\" easily in the fall, predicts most Republicans will wind up backing his candidacy. \"You know, the party's come together,\" Trump told NBC's Meet the Press. \"I have tremendous numbers of endorsements. I'm never going to get Romney's endorsement. He choked. He blew the last election.\"",

The briefing follows President Obama's receipt of the report, which he ordered in December, and ahead of the public release of an unclassified version of the report early next week.\n\nThe report, prepared by the CIA, FBI, and NSA, will be presented to Mr. Trump by four intelligence chiefs, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers.\n\nFor several weeks, the president-elect has questioned the U.S. intelligence community's integrity and its assessment that Russia not only launched cyberattacks against the U.S. to sow doubt in the election but to sway the outcome in favor of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has also doubted Russia's responsibility for cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC), other political groups, and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Clapper previewed some of the report's findings, stating that hacking was only part of Russia's cyber activities during the election. He also mentioned the use of classical propaganda, disinformation, and fake news.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, and Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) are among several Republicans in Congress who have expressed the need for the new administration to develop a more clear-cut cyber policy and to punish Russia for its actions. They have urged the Trump administration to take a strong stance against Russia's actions and to work with Congress to craft a cyber policy.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) has suggested that the Obama administration's actions against Russian intelligence agents and entities were not sufficient and has advised the president-elect to take a more aggressive approach. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) plans to roll out legislation containing tougher sanctions against Russia in the coming week.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have criticized Mr. Trump for questioning the integrity of the intelligence community. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) asked Clapper, \"Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community?\" Clapper responded, \"I think there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism... I think there's a difference between skepticism and disparagement.\"\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) expressed faith in the intelligence community but also acknowledged room for improvement. On the question of whether Russians meddled in the presidential election, Ryan firmly believes the intelligence. \"Did the Russians hack us? Yes. Is it right for any country to meddle in our elections? No,\" he said.",
    " Title: White House Honors Evangelical Leaders, Celebrates Religious Freedom, and Expresses Gratitude for John McCain's Service\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a unique twist, Monday afternoon's celebration at the White House was not a state dinner honoring a foreign head of state, but a gathering to recognize and pay tribute to evangelical leaders. President Donald Trump, in his address, emphasized America's religious identity, stating, \"America is a nation of believers, and tonight we are joined by faith leaders from around the country.\"\n\nAmong the faith leaders being honored were Rev. Franklin Graham and Pastor Paula White. The president also took a moment to publicly express gratitude for the late Sen. John McCain's (R-AZ) service to America. \"Our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Sen. John McCain... and we very much appreciate everything Sen. McCain has done for our country,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president then shifted his focus to the dinner's purpose: honoring America's faith and freedom. \"In recent years, the government tried to undermine religious freedom, but the attacks on communities of faith are over. We have ended it,\" Trump declared. The commander in chief drummed up applause, highlighting his administration's efforts to combat religious persecution.\n\n\"We brought home hostages from North Korea, including an American pastor, and we are fighting to release Pastor Brunson from Turkey, and we have made great progress,\" Trump said. The president emphasized the importance of people of faith voting in the midterms to ensure the progress continues. This sentiment was echoed by Pastor Robert Jeffress, a staunch supporter of the president.\n\n\"They are facing the possibility of a Democrat Congress that, if they take control of the legislature, will either impeach this president from office or at least paralyze him while he is in office. I think they rightly know evangelicals do not want either of those to happen,\" Pastor Jeffress said.\n\nChristians played a significant role in propelling Trump into office in 2016, and Monday evening's White House affair was one way of showing appreciation for their contribution to American society and pledging to protect their rights so their work can continue. \"The support you've given me has been incredible, but I really do not feel guilty because I have given you a lot back,\" Trump said.\n\nRalph Reed, the Faith & Freedom Coalition's founder, weighed in, stating, \"The president just wanted to celebrate, and not just that, but what our churches and houses of worship do every day \u2013 to provide spiritual direction to the lost, heal the broken-hearted, to save marriages and lives \u2013 that goes every day in America.\"",
    " Title: The Financial Consequences of White Supremacy: A Reflection on Charlottesville and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, the financial repercussions of publicly espousing white supremacist views have become increasingly evident. This article delves into the economic implications of such beliefs, drawing on insights from recent analyses and personal experiences.\n\nLast week, Nick Gillespie discussed the freedom of association and its implications, highlighting the power dynamics involved in such choices. In a similar vein, this piece will focus on the desires and motivations of those who participated in the Charlottesville rally, as explored by Kevin Williamson in his National Review article. Williamson suggests that these individuals are seeking identity and purpose in their white supremacist ideology, a reflection of failed individual identities.\n\nGrowing up in a town where the Confederate flag was commonplace, the author shares a personal connection with the white supremacist movement. The author's ancestors fought for the Confederacy, and their forebears were members of descendant organizations. The author's high school friend, who identified as a neo-Nazi, struggled to articulate a coherent explanation for his grievances, often blaming Jews, despite the lack of a significant Jewish presence in their town.\n\nIn 2012, several of the author's former classmates were arrested by the FBI for training with American Front, a white supremacist group. The author recalls the fear and uncertainty these developments may have instilled in people of color living nearby. However, the author emphasizes that these individuals, despite their intimidating appearance, were ultimately \"sore losers\" - people who, like many others, have not achieved their desired success due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nThe author argues that most individuals who fail to succeed in life, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, understand the importance of treating others with respect and kindness. This mutual respect is essential for a harmonious working environment, as demonstrated by the author's experiences working in construction alongside individuals from various racial and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"dapper\" echelons of the alt-right, with their education and historical knowledge, have also learned the hard way that being publicly abhorrent will not lead to acceptance in mainstream society. The author hopes that this financial backlash will serve as a reminder that respect and kindness are essential for individual and societal success, regardless of one's political or ideological beliefs.",
    " Title: Greece's Finance Minister Resigns as EU Leaders Meet to Address Crisis After Referendum\n\nArticle:\n\nGreece and its European Union partners are navigating the aftermath of a significant turn of events following the country's mass rejection of a German-led bailout plan. The New York Times reports that the hard negotiations begin as Greece seeks to renegotiate more favorable terms for its bailout, while its European partners may insist on stringent conditions that could potentially lead to Greece's exit from the EU.\n\nEurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem described the vote as \"regrettable for the future of Greece,\" and called an emergency meeting on Tuesday. CNBC reports that EU leaders expect Greece to present a new proposal soon.\n\nThe vote's first tangible impact was felt on Monday with the resignation of Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. In a statement, Varoufakis expressed hope that his resignation would aid Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in securing better terms for his country.\n\n\"Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted 'partners,' for my... 'absence' from its meetings; an idea that the Prime Minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement,\" Varoufakis said. \"For this reason I am leaving the Ministry of Finance today.\"\n\nVaroufakis praised the vote as a \"splendid\" and \"historic\" moment for Greece, rising up against \"debt bondage.\" He added, \"I shall wear the creditors' loathing with pride.\"\n\nGreece has appointed Euclid Tsakalotos as its new finance minister. Reuters reports that Tsakalotos, a key negotiator in talks between the Greek government and creditors, is likely to maintain a firm stance on the contentious issue of debt relief.\n\nDuring a press conference today, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis acknowledged the \"democratic choice of the Greek people,\" but stated that the no vote \"widens the gap between Greece and Eurozone countries.\"\n\n\"There is no easy way out of this crisis,\" Dombrovskis said. \"Too much time and too many opportunities have been lost.\"\n\nDombrovskis explained that the European Commission cannot negotiate new terms with Greece without a mandate from eurogroup countries. He also emphasized that the eurozone is not in danger, and concluded, \"One thing is clear: the place of Greece is, and remains, in Europe. To solve this very difficult situation, all sides need to work together responsibly for the sake of the Greek people.\"",
    " Title: Mississippi Senate Runoff Candidates Face Heightened Scrutiny Over Racial Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The runoff election between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, vying to become Mississippi's first African-American Senator since the Reconstruction, is under national scrutiny as reports surface about Hyde-Smith's past connections to a segregation academy and her praise for a Confederate soldier's efforts.\n\nThe Jackson Free Press, an independent newspaper in Mississippi, and CNN have reported that Hyde-Smith attended Lawrence County Academy, a school founded in 1970, the year many Mississippi public high schools integrated. The school was created for parents who did not want to send their children to schools with black students, according to the Free Press.\n\nThe Free Press reported that the school's yearbook includes a group photo of the cheerleading squad, of which Hyde-Smith was a member. The photo shows the school's mascot dressed in what appears to be a Confederate uniform holding a Confederate flag.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Scallan, responded to the report, stating, \"In their latest attempt to help Mike Espy, the gotcha liberal media has taken leave of their senses. They have stooped to a new low, attacking her entire family and trying to destroy her personally instead of focusing on the clear differences on the issues between Cindy Hyde-Smith and her far-left opponent.\"\n\nFurther reports have delved into Hyde-Smith's work as a legislator and found she once praised a Confederate soldier for his work to \"defend his homeland.\" CNN reports that as a state senator in 2007, Hyde-Smith co-sponsored a resolution that honored Effie Lucille Nicholson Pharr, whose father was a soldier in Robert E. Lee's army. The resolution said her father \"fought to defend his homeland and contributed to the rebuilding of the country.\"\n\nEspy has repeatedly pointed to the comments while campaigning. Hyde-Smith apologized for the \"hanging\" comments during a debate earlier this week and dubbed the voting suppression comments a \"joke.\" The continued reports have garnered national attention to the runoff race, which is expected to see a higher-than-average turnout. President Donald Trump is planning multiple rallies next week ahead of the election to help lock another Republican seat in the Senate after large losses in the House allowed Democrats to gain control.",
    " Title: Trump's First Month in Office: Navigating the Washington Maze\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - President Donald Trump is facing a challenging reality in his first month in office: the complexities of the Washington bureaucracy and political landscape, which have posed significant hurdles for his administration.\n\nIn his first four weeks, Trump has encountered the stark contrast between managing a business and leading a nation. The vast government machine, unlike a business, cannot be reset at a president's whim. Rival power centers in the courts, the bureaucracy, and Congress can emerge as threats at any point.\n\nIn the past week alone, political pressure forced Trump to dismiss his National Security Adviser and witness one of his Cabinet nominees withdraw from consideration. The President is also grappling with persistent and growing questions about his campaign's ties to Russia, as some fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill become more vocal about their concerns. Legislative victories remain elusive as congressional Republicans struggle to unify behind policy measures, and Democrats form a generally solid bloc of opposition.\n\nThe transition from candidate to president is a tough process for most young administrations. Presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton faced rocky opening weeks as their campaign idealism collided with Washington reality. However, Trump's first month in office is noteworthy due to the self-inflicted wounds that have plagued his administration, from the rushed rollout of his travel ban to his frequent Twitter distractions.\n\nThe turmoil surrounding the new administration could undermine a central tenet of Trump's pitch to voters: that he is a non-politician uniquely positioned to make a deal and get Washington working again.\n\n\"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,\" Trump said last summer when he accepted the GOP nomination in Cleveland. \"I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens.\"\n\nTrump started out in Washington by keeping faith with these beliefs, unleashing a whirlwind of executive orders that demonstrated a determination to wield firm executive power. However, the backlash was swift as the checks on presidential power soon activated.\n\nTrump quickly encountered the judiciary when a federal court halted his controversial executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. Despite GOP majorities in Congress, Trump is not making much progress on his legislative agenda. Opposition is growing in the Senate to paying for his border wall now that Mexico has refused to fund it, according to CNN's Manu Raju. Democrats have frustrated the President by delaying confirmation of Cabinet nominees.\n\n\"That's all they're doing is delaying,\" Trump said during an extraordinary White House press conference last week. \"And you look at (Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going.\"\n\nA leaky federal government and intelligence community with which he is locked in a perpetual state of war are also resisting Trump's attempts to exert control over his administration. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus denied Sunday that there was dysfunction in the President's inner circle.\n\n\"The truth is that we do not have problems in the West Wing,\" Priebus said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"The amount of drama and spin that you read about mostly in the Washington daily gossip rags is unbelievable stuff. And it just is not true.\"\n\nAmid the negative headlines, Trump is seeking to connect directly with the American people. He delivered a speech Friday touting his jobs agenda at a Boeing factory in South Carolina and a campaign-style rally over the weekend in Florida. He is slated to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress later this month, providing him with one of the strongest venues available to project presidential strength.\n\nHowever, Trump's early stumbles have overshadowed some of the areas where he could otherwise claim success. Well-choreographed visits from the leaders of Britain, Israel, Canada, and Japan followed a host of executive orders that began to dismantle Obamacare and federal regulations and open the way for cross-continental pipelines, as well as Trump's withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. His unveiling of Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the open Supreme Court seat was one of the most flawless moments of his presidency.\n\nStill, controversy can develop in unexpected directions in Washington and exhaust a White House staff in a way that can be detrimental to a presidency. Trump is not the first President to come into power with a team that does not seem to quite measure up to Washington's demands.\n\n\"I think every administration goes through that,\" said Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority leader. \"I was here through Carter, when a bunch of Georgians who thought they were the smartest guys in town arrived and they were going to fix everything.\"\n\n\"When (Ronald) Reagan came to town, he brought a bunch of Californians, idealistic ideologues who found out pretty quick that they needed help from Jim Baker,\" Lott said.\n\nThrough trial and error, Clinton and Reagan learned to work the inside game in Washington to advance what were sometimes seen as outsider political aims. However, Trump's attempts to fight back against the restrictions all presidents face could be complicated by another factor: his idiosyncratic character and political style, which were an undoubted asset when he reinvented the rules of the presidential campaign but have not yet proven effective in governing.\n\nHis constant feuds with enemies, sometimes on Twitter, cast doubt on his temperament, as do his unpredictable eruptions and struggles to stop gloating about his election win. His press conference and weekend rallies helped keep his loyal supporters happy and boosted his own morale. But it seems unlikely that he meaningfully advanced his political agenda.\n\nGOP majorities on Capitol Hill should ensure that big-ticket issues like tax cuts and Wall Street reform get done and that Trump can bill them as the kind of \"wins\" he promised would dazzle Washington. And if any politician can get away with such polarizing tactics, it's Trump.\n\n\"The President's campaign essentially changed the laws of physics last year,\" said Bill Lacy, director of the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.\n\n\"All the so-called experts have been wrong consistently,\" Lacy said, adding that Trump had changed the way presidents are viewed along with the usual codes of behavior in the White House and Washington. \"Traditionally, a President could not do that and get away with it. With this president, that remains to be seen.\"",
    " Title: House GOP Blocks Immigration Measures on National Defense Authorization Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant setback for immigration reform advocates, the House Republican leadership has blocked a pair of immigration-related proposals from being voted on as amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Wednesday. The move marks another hurdle in the ongoing efforts to rewrite the U.S. immigration system this year.\n\nThe Republican-led House Rules Committee, which adheres closely to the wishes of leadership, declined to include the ENLIST Act, a bill authored by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) that provides a path to green cards for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children if they serve in the military, among the amendments to be considered on the NDAA.\n\nRep. Denham expressed his disappointment over the decision, stating, \"I am disappointed that my ENLIST amendment was not ruled in order this year. I will continue to push for a vote on the stand-alone bill so that undocumented young people who want to perform the ultimate act of patriotism will have that opportunity and be able to earn legal status through their sacrifice.\"\n\nAnother immigration measure, from Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), that would allow young immigrants who have been granted a reprieve from deportations by the Obama administration to enroll in U.S. military academies, was also blocked from a vote.\n\nRep. Castro expressed his dismay in a statement, saying, \"I'm disappointed that expanding opportunity to all of our students to the U.S. military academies is not allowed to be part of the discussion about our nation's defense readiness.\" He plans to introduce the measure as a standalone bill with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.).\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) stated Tuesday that including Denham's legislation, known as the ENLIST Act, on a must-pass bill such as the NDAA was \"inappropriate,\" although he noted that Republican leaders have supported the measure in the past. Boehner added that there are talks about allowing the bill to get a stand-alone vote on the House floor.\n\nWith more than 300 amendments filed to the NDAA, only 162 of them will be considered on the legislation, a sweeping annual measure that sets policy for the Pentagon.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Debate: America's Mission in Syria and the Pursuit of Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' involvement in Syria, initially aimed at combating the Islamic State (ISIS), has evolved into a complex geopolitical puzzle, with conflicting narratives surrounding the American presence in the war-torn country. The withdrawal of U.S. troops, as announced by President Donald Trump, has sparked controversy, with some viewing it as a strategic retreat, while others see it as a necessary step to avoid entanglement in a never-ending conflict.\n\nThe mission's objectives have shifted significantly since the U.S. first intervened in 2012. Initially, the focus was on supporting \"moderate\" Syrian rebels in their fight against the Assad regime. However, the emergence of ISIS in eastern Syria and western Iraq led to a new emphasis on combating this terrorist group. The fight against ISIS, in turn, was often conflated with the goal of toppling the Assad regime and countering Iran's influence in the region.\n\nThe public's support for combating ISIS has provided a legal basis for U.S. intervention, with the 2001 Authorized Use of Military Force serving as the legal imprimatur. However, the foreign policy establishment's desire to confront Iran and challenge the Assad regime in Syria has often been at odds with this popular support.\n\nProposals for a more significant U.S. presence in Syria, such as Frederick Kagan's suggestion of inserting 40,000 to 50,000 troops in 2015, have been met with skepticism and resistance. The latest plan, as outlined by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017, aimed to reduce Iran's influence, facilitate the return of refugees, ensure Syria's denuclearization, transition from Assad's leadership, and prevent the resurgence of ISIS and al-Qaeda.\n\nHowever, the mission's objectives have been criticized for their ambiguity and the lack of a clear end-state. Critics argue that the U.S. mission in Syria has become a form of \"mission creep,\" with objectives expanding beyond the initial goal of defeating ISIS.\n\nAs the Islamic State's territorial caliphate has been destroyed, the rationale for continued U.S. involvement in Syria has become increasingly tenuous. Some, like David French, argue for denying ISIS any safe haven, while others see the mission's original objective as fulfilled and advocate for a complete withdrawal.\n\nThe debate surrounding the U.S. mission in Syria underscores the complexities of modern warfare and the challenges of defining clear objectives in a rapidly evolving conflict. As the U.S. grapples with these issues, it remains to be seen how the mission will ultimately be resolved and whether the American presence in Syria will continue to be a source of controversy or a stepping stone toward a more stable and secure region.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at Abortion Laws: New York, Alabama, and the Polarized Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over abortion rights in the United States, the recent passage of new laws in New York and Alabama has sparked intense controversy and polarization. Protesters outside the Alabama State Capitol held signs against the state's new abortion law on May 19, 2019.\n\nThe controversy has been fueled by conflicting narratives, with President Trump and some cable news personalities accusing Democrats of supporting extreme late-term abortions, while leading Democrats and fact-checkers argue that these claims are distortions and exaggerations.\n\nThe controversy began in January when Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, supported a bill introduced by Democratic delegate Kathy Tran to liberalize abortion in Virginia. During a colloquy with a Republican lawmaker, Tran's bill would have allowed late-term abortions through the 40th week of pregnancy, including during labor.\n\nNortham, in supporting Tran and her bill, explained that in cases where a fetus was not viable, the infant would be delivered, resuscitated, and a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother. While Northam never said anything about \"executing\" babies, Tran's bill would have allowed late-term abortions of viable, non-deformed babies solely if the mother's mental or emotional health was threatened.\n\nTran's bill did not pass, but it was part of a trend in liberal states to loosen abortion laws even further. Earlier in January, Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had signed similar legislation.\n\nThe media's response to the New York law was relatively muted, while the Alabama law has sparked a frenzy. This disparity speaks to the legal and political landscape, as well as the media's stance on the issue.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which imposed one of the most permissive abortion regimes in the world, has created a polarized and polarizing dynamic in which the debate is dominated by the extremes. Overturning Roe and allowing states to pass laws that reflect majority opinion might not defuse the political passion, but at some point, we are likely to find out.\n\nThe underlying political reality is that most Americans want a compromise, but the parties are more responsive to the activists and donors. As a result, Democrats have abandoned their \"safe, legal, and rare\" rhetoric, while Republicans are downplaying a \"culture of life.\" Instead, each seeks to cast the other party as extreme.\n\nThe passage of the Alabama law is a deliberate attempt by the state's GOP legislators to challenge Roe v. Wade and potentially overturn it. The New York law, on the other hand, was not an attempt to test Roe or Casey but to create a post-Roe abortion \"sanctuary\" in case the court does reverse Roe.\n\nIn terms of public attitudes, both the New York and Alabama laws are extreme, with most Americans supporting early-stage abortions but opposition growing along with the fetus. According to Gallup, 60 percent of Americans support abortion rights in the first trimester, but only 13 percent do in the third trimester.\n\nThe debate over abortion rights in the United States is complex and emotionally charged, with both sides holding deeply held beliefs. As the political landscape continues to shift, it remains to be seen how this issue will be resolved and whether compromise can be found.",
    " Title: Memorial Day Calls for National Unity Amidst COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation commemorates Memorial Day, the country is faced with an unprecedented crisis in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus, an external threat, has led to a calamity that requires national unity, shared sacrifices, and collective efforts to rebuild. However, the current political climate has made it easy to slip into partisanship, with ideological blinders clouding the need for unity.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic is staggering. Approximately 35 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, with millions more unemployed but not counted. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses have closed, and major retailers like JC Penny and J. Crew are declaring bankruptcy. Manufacturing plants like Ford that reopened have had to close again as workers contracted the virus. Major industries like the airlines are surviving only with government and Federal Reserve assistance.\n\nThe human toll is equally devastating. Over 90,000 people have died from the virus, with tens of thousands more weakened or crippled by its effects. Homeowners and renters can't pay their mortgages or rent, graduates can't keep up with their student loans, small businesses exhaust their reserves and are forced to lay off their workers, front-line workers deal with immense stress and constant risk of infection, and states and localities face plummeting revenues and rising costs, leading to layoffs and service cuts.\n\nPeople are understandably scared, worried, and angry due to plans and hopes that were suddenly dashed through no fault of their own. At this time, as in wartime, the government must act. It must organize the collective response to the attack, provide medical and protective gear, develop testing and tracing strategies, distribute health resources, and galvanize an all-out effort for a remedy. The government must also limit the damage\u2014keeping families in their homes, small businesses in their offices or stores, and workers in their jobs.\n\nRecent statements by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Lindsey Graham have raised concerns about the urgency to aid states and localities, suggesting that states could go bankrupt, and that the crisis is largely due to \"blue-state\" mismanagement. These statements have been met with criticism, as the casualties are not partisan but affect people of all political leanings, income levels, and geographical locations.\n\nThe response to the crisis cannot be partisan. It is crucial for leaders to emerge, move beyond their comfort zones, and offer bold responses to the stark crisis. This is not a moment for posturing but for patriotism, solidarity, and action. Let us hope that Memorial Day celebrations may help our leaders remember this challenge.\n\nMost Americans would agree that aiding the unemployed through no fault of their own is not controversial. A paycheck guarantee program, championed by some conservative Senate Republicans and progressive House Democrats, could support small business owners to pay their employees even when their businesses are locked down. This would enable workers to keep their benefits, get their pay, and owners to sustain their teams.\n\nSimilarly, most Americans would agree that everyone should have access to treatment and testing without financial worry. Most would agree that we should not bankrupt the post office. Most would agree that we need to make voting safe in the fall. Voting by mail is not a partisan agenda; it is a safety agenda.\n\nThis Memorial Day, let us remember the sacrifices of those who have served our country and use that memory to inspire unity, solidarity, and action in the face of the current crisis. Let us hope that our leaders will rise to the challenge and work together to support the American people in these difficult times.",
    " Title: Islamic State Launches Offensive on Ramadi, Iraqi Military Faces Setback in Anbar Province\n\nArticle:\n\nIslamic State militants have launched a fierce attack on the city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province in western Iraq, marking a setback for the Iraqi military's ongoing offensive in the Sunni-dominated region. The militants have reportedly gained a foothold in some areas of the city, according to Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim.\n\nSunni tribal leaders, who have been holding out in Ramadi, have reportedly expressed concerns about their shortage of weapons and ammunition, as well as intense pressure from the extremist group. Sterling Jensen, an assistant professor at the United Arab Emirates' National Defense College in Abu Dhabi, who maintains close contact with tribal leaders, confirmed these reports.\n\nThe Iraqi government, however, maintains that it remains in control of Ramadi. U.S. Central Command stated that the Iraqi government has reclaimed about 25% of the territory that was captured last year by the Islamic State. The fighting in Anbar is a key test for Iraq's military's goal to push the militants out of the country.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is currently in Washington, where he has requested additional U.S. support in the fight against the Islamic State. The Pentagon reported that the Iraqi armed forces, backed by U.S. airstrikes, have been making progress in regaining territory from the Islamic State.\n\nResidents of Anbar have reported that the militants have captured several villages, including Sjariyah, Albu-Ghanim, and Soufiya, which have provided the extremists with a launching point for their attack on Ramadi. The fighting in Anbar is significant as it is located along the main roads linking Baghdad to the Syrian border, and the militants entered Iraq from Syria, where they have been fighting to overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.\n\nSome residents of Anbar have sided with the Islamic State militants due to their shared Sunni identity and feelings of alienation from Iraq's Shiite-dominated government. Other tribes have fought against the militants, complaining of insufficient support from Baghdad. Washington has encouraged the Iraqi government to provide the Sunni tribes with arms and other support to carry out the fight against the extremists.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi expressed concern on Wednesday about the conflict in Yemen, stating that his government is \"uneasy\" about U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia, which is carrying out airstrikes against Shiite rebels in Yemen. Al-Abadi told reporters that the conflict \"has all the potential to become a sectarian war.\"",

She questioned, \"@realDonaldTrump's continued efforts to undermine Special Counsel Mueller's investigation raises the questions: What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump, politically, personally or financially?\"\n\nPelosi also implied that the president's stance on NATO could be beneficial to Putin's foreign policy. \"Why has the Trump Administration continued to discuss pulling the U.S. out of NATO, which would be a massive victory for Putin?\" she asked.\n\nThe suggestion that Trump is acting in the interests of Putin due to some form of compromising information has been a recurring theme among the president's critics. Trump has consistently denied these allegations.\n\nIn a statement, Pelosi stated, \"Lying to Congress and witness tampering constitute grave crimes. All who commit these illegal acts should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\" She added, \"We cannot allow any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from appearing before Congress.\"\n\nThe ongoing investigations and allegations continue to add complexity to the political landscape, with both sides presenting their interpretations of the events. The full extent of the relationship between Trump, Stone, and Putin remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Gun Violence Hearing: Gayle Trotter Advocates for Women's Right to Bear Arms for Self-Defense\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent Senate hearing on gun violence, tax attorney Gayle Trotter, the lone woman on a five-member panel, argued that women should have the right to own guns for self-defense due to their physical vulnerability against larger, stronger male criminals.\n\n\"For women, the ability to arm ourselves for our protection is even more consequential than for men because guns are the great equalizer in a violent confrontation,\" Trotter stated. \"As a result, we protect women by safeguarding our Second Amendment rights. Every woman deserves a fighting chance.\"\n\nHowever, Trotter's stance on women's right to bear arms has been a subject of controversy, as her views on women's roles in the military have come under scrutiny. In June, Trotter published an op-ed that criticized the idea of allowing women to serve in combat, focusing on the potential impact on women's roles as mothers.\n\n\"Many young single women are specifically recruited to serve in our military,\" Trotter wrote. \"When you mix young women with fit young men, pregnancies are to be expected.\"\n\nTrotter further argued that a woman's role as a mother was more important than a position in the military. \"Do the principles of women's 'liberation' embrace jailing mothers for refusing to leave their kids behind with strangers?\" Trotter asked rhetorically. \"If a woman is not free to care for her child, what kind of liberation does she have?\"\n\nCritics seeking to preserve the ban against women in combat have argued that women are inevitably less fit than their male counterparts. Trotter's testimony today echoed this argument, equating women with mothers.\n\n\"If we ban these types of assault weapons, you are putting women at a great disadvantage, more so than men, because they do not have the same type of physical strength and opportunity to defend themselves in a hand-to-hand struggle,\" Trotter told members of the Senate today. \"And they're not criminals; they're moms. They're young women. And they're not used to violent confrontations.\"\n\nTrotter did not mention the biological or emotional problems former presidential candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich referenced in their arguments against women in combat. The debate surrounding women's roles in the military and their right to bear arms continues to be a contentious issue, with Trotter's testimony adding a unique perspective to the ongoing discussion.",
    " Title: Assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents Reach Decade High in 2017, Report Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a concerning development, the number of assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and U.S. Border Patrol agents has reached a decade high, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general. The report, which suggests that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are increasingly resorting to violence, could potentially underestimate the actual number of incidents due to inadequate tracking and reporting mechanisms.\n\nThe report highlights a significant increase in violence, particularly on the southwest border, where agents report a surge in illegal immigration correlates with growing violence. The most frequent method of attack was projectiles, such as large rocks, which accounted for half of all assaults. Other methods included bombs, clubs, knives, guns, and laser pointers. The majority of injuries were minor and did not require medical treatment.\n\nIn 2010, Customs and Border Protection recorded 1,089 assaults, a number that steadily decreased through 2014, with just 381 assaults. However, the number of assaults began to rise again, reaching 856 in 2017. Last year was the most violent this decade at the border, with 28 assaults per every 10,000 apprehensions.\n\nIn the interior, ICE agents and officers saw 48 assaults in 2017, tying 2010 as the highest in records going back to the beginning of the decade. ICE officers and Border Patrol agents have reported an increasing willingness on the part of migrants to resort to violence in recent years.\n\nOne of the incidents recorded in 2017 involved Lester Sadict Cruz-Garcia, an immigrant from Honduras who was arrested by police in New York on a domestic assault charge. Despite a request by ICE that he be held, he was released into the community. When ICE officers attempted to apprehend him at his home, he struggled and kicked, attempting to get away. He was eventually handcuffed but bit one of the officers, causing injury. The officer was hospitalized and prescribed antibiotics.\n\nAnother incident involved ICE officers in Massachusetts trying to deport Mohammed Kenneh to Liberia. Kenneh resisted, knocking one officer to the ground and using his handcuffs to ensnare the officer's hand. The officer was taken to the emergency room.\n\nThese incidents underscore the renewed danger faced by law enforcement officers on the frontlines of immigration enforcement. The report also found that prosecutors often refuse to bring charges or win cases against the perpetrators. The full extent of the problem may be underestimated due to inadequate tracking and reporting mechanisms.",
    " Title: Apple and Google Collaborate on Contact Tracing Technology: Privacy Concerns Raised\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint effort to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, tech giants Apple and Google have announced the development of software designed to aid in contact tracing. The software aims to alert individuals who have come into close proximity with people who have tested positive for the virus.\n\nContact tracing has been identified as a crucial tool in containing the spread of the virus, and numerous leading public health authorities, universities, and NGOs worldwide are working on opt-in contact tracing technology. Apple and Google's solution will involve the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to facilitate contact tracing.\n\nThe plan is to implement this solution in two stages, with the first step involving the release of APIs in May, enabling interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities. These apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores.\n\nIn the coming months, Apple and Google will work towards a more robust solution by integrating contact tracing functionality into the underlying platforms. This would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, and enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities.\n\nPrivacy, transparency, and consent are key priorities in this initiative, and both companies plan to collaborate with interested stakeholders in building this functionality. They also intend to openly publish information about their work for others to analyze.\n\nHowever, there are concerns about the extent to which users can truly \"opt out\" of data collection. In a blog post, Hot Air's Allahpundit questioned the effectiveness of the opt-out mechanism, suggesting that even those who choose to opt out may still be tracked. Allahpundit wrote, \"An obvious early question: How thorough will the 'opt out' be, exactly? Given how much personal information is collected surreptitiously by tech companies already, it's impossible to believe that the movements of opt-outs won't be quietly tracked too.\"\n\nAllahpundit also noted that the technology appears to function similarly to a program instituted in Germany to combat the virus, which broadcasts different IDs every 30 minutes as someone goes about their day. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the software would trace which IDs came into contact with the temporary IDs of the coronavirus-positive person and send an alert that they may have interacted with someone who had the virus.\n\nWhile the widespread testing for the virus is still lacking, the implementation of this technology requires it. As Allahpundit pointed out, the success of the contact tracing system relies heavily on the availability of testing.",
    " Title: Senate Passes Tax Overhaul Bill, Moving Closer to Major Legislative Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Senate has passed a sweeping tax reform bill worth approximately $1.4 trillion, marking a significant step towards President Donald Trump's first major legislative victory. The vote, which took place early Saturday morning, was 51-49, with Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee being the sole GOP member to vote against the bill alongside the Democrats.\n\nFollowing the vote, President Trump took to Twitter, expressing his approval: \"We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America,\" the president wrote. He also thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch for guiding the bill through the Senate.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded by calling the legislation a \"betrayal of the American middle class.\" In a statement, Pelosi described the bill as a product of \"haste, carelessness, and cruelty,\" and stated that it was written for the wealthiest one percent, not middle-class families.\n\nThe bill is not yet finalized, as the Senate and House have passed similar tax reform plans. Negotiators from both chambers will begin meeting on Monday to agree on a single piece of legislation that both chambers must approve before it is sent to the president for his signature.\n\nThe Senate bill eliminates federal deductions for state and local income and sales taxes, but allows deductions of up to $10,000 in local property taxes. The legislation also nearly doubles the standard deduction level to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. The Senate bill retains the current limit for the home mortgage interest deduction and preserves the deduction for medical expenses not covered by insurance, while ending deductions for moving expenses and tax preparation.\n\nThe Senate bill also repeals ObamaCare's individual mandate, which is expected to lead to thousands of people dropping their health insurance, raising costs for those who decide to keep it. The Senate and House bills both eliminate the $4,050 personal tax exemption.\n\nThe Senate bill keeps seven tax brackets, but reduces them to 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, and 38.5 percent. The House measure condenses seven brackets to four: 12, 25, 35, and 39.6 percent. The Senate bill allows owners of pass-through businesses to deduct 23 percent of their earnings, and then pay at their personal income tax rate on the remainder.\n\nThe changes will not have any impact on taxes for 2017, which are due to the IRS by April 17, 2018. The House will vote on a motion to go to conference on the tax bills on Monday evening, and the Senate is expected to vote on a similar measure soon after. The changes will come into force on Jan. 1, if the bill is passed.",
    " Title: Senate's Second-Ranking Democrat Confirms Kathleen Sebelius to Testify on ObamaCare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), announced on Sunday that Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius will testify before Congress regarding the problem-plagued Healthcare.gov website. The announcement comes amidst growing calls for Sebelius to testify about the website, which has experienced crashes, slow responses, and other glitches since its launch on October 1.\n\nSebelius and the Obama administration have so far declined requests to testify on Capitol Hill about the site. Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter directly to Sebelius, asking her to testify on Thursday about the matter. As of yet, Sebelius has not responded publicly, but her reported plans to attend a gala in Boston on the night before have fueled calls for her resignation.\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio expressed his reluctance to call for an immediate dismissal, but was critical of Sebelius for not agreeing to testify. \"Her refusal to testify and be transparent has undermined her credibility,\" he told a news outlet, adding that her not testifying could lead to her resignation.\n\nHouse investigators are reportedly interested in determining whether officials involved in the website \"didn't know or didn't disclose\" problems, after repeatedly stating that the site was \"on track\" to launch. Though the White House said this weekend that 476,000 people have applied online for health insurance, officials have yet to disclose how many people have actually purchased a policy.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told a news outlet that Sebelius' position appears \"unsustainable.\" \"She can not sustain it,\" he said. \"She'll have to testify.\"\n\nThe focus on Secretary Sebelius intensified after she appeared on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" last week to discuss the website. Commerce committee Chairman Fred Upton began focusing on Sebelius after her television appearance, stating, \"Secretary Sebelius had time for Jon Stewart, and we expect her to have time for Congress.\"",
    " Title: Judge Delays Sentencing for Michael Flynn, Cites Lying to FBI and Undeclared Lobbying\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday criticized former national security adviser Michael Flynn for lying to FBI agents during an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delayed sentencing him until Flynn has completed his cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that he had arguably betrayed his country. Sullivan also noted that Flynn had operated as an undeclared lobbyist for Turkey while working on President Donald Trump's campaign team and preparing to be his White House national security adviser.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador in Washington, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. The conversations took place between Trump's November election victory and his inauguration in January 2017.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia ahead of the election, had asked the judge not to sentence Flynn to prison because he had already provided \"substantial\" cooperation over the course of many interviews.\n\nLying to the FBI carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison. Flynn's plea agreement stated that he was eligible for a sentence of between zero and six months.\n\nSullivan sternly told Flynn his actions were abhorrent, noting that Flynn had also lied to senior White House officials, who in turn misled the public. The judge said he had read additional facts about Flynn's behavior that have not been made public.\n\nAt one point, Sullivan asked prosecutors if Flynn could have been charged with treason, although the judge later said he had not been suggesting such a charge was warranted.\n\n\"Arguably, you sold your country out,\" Sullivan told Flynn. \"I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense.\"\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- Factbox: Mueller and other probes posing risk for Trump\n- Flynn, dressed in a suit and tie, showed little emotion throughout the hearing, and spoke calmly when he confirmed his guilty plea and answered questions from the judge.\n\nSullivan appeared ready to sentence Flynn to prison but then gave him the option of a delay in his sentencing so he could fully cooperate with any pending investigations and bolster his case for leniency. The judge told Flynn he could not promise that he would not eventually sentence him to serve prison time.\n\nFlynn accepted that offer. Sullivan did not set a new date for sentencing but asked Mueller's team and Flynn's attorney to give him a status report by March 13.\n\nSullivan later imposed travel restrictions on Flynn, ordering him to surrender his passport and to obtain court permission before traveling outside the Washington area. The curbs are typical for people released on their own recognizance, the judge said.\n\nProsecutors said Flynn had already provided most of the cooperation he could, but it was possible he might be able to help investigators further. Flynn's attorney said his client is cooperating with federal prosecutors in a case against Bijan Rafiekian, his former business partner who has been charged with unregistered lobbying for Turkey.\n\nRafiekian pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to those charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 11. Flynn is expected to testify.\n\nProsecutors have said Rafiekian and Flynn lobbied to have Washington extradite a Muslim cleric who lives in the United States and is accused by Turkey's government of backing a 2016 coup attempt. Flynn has not been charged in that case.\n\nFormer U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn departs after his sentencing was delayed at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nFlynn was a high-profile adviser to Trump's campaign team. At the Republican Party's national convention in 2016, Flynn led Trump's supporters in cries of \"Lock her up!\" directed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nA group of protesters, including some who chanted \"Lock him up,\" gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, along with a large inflatable rat fashioned to look like Trump. Several Flynn supporters also were there, cheering as he entered and exited. One held a sign that read, \"Michael Flynn is a hero.\"\n\nFlynn became national security adviser when Trump took office in January 2017, but lasted only 24 days before being fired.\n\nHe told FBI investigators on Jan. 24, 2017, that he had not discussed the U.S. sanctions with Kislyak when in fact he had, according to his plea agreement. Trump has said he fired Flynn because he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts with Kislyak.\n\nTrump has said Flynn did not break the law and has voiced support for him, raising speculation the Republican president might pardon him.\n\n\"Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter the hearing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the FBI had \"ambushed\" Flynn in the way agents questioned him, but said his \"activities\" at the center of the case \"don't have anything to do with the president\" and disputed that Flynn had committed treason.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has called his former long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges, a \"rat.\"\n\nMueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe has cast a shadow over his presidency. Several former Trump aides have pleaded guilty in Mueller's probe, but Flynn was the first former Trump White House official to do so. Mueller also has charged a series of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nTrump has called Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt\" and has denied collusion with Moscow.\n\nRussia has denied meddling in the election, contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that have said Moscow used hacking and propaganda to try to sow discord in the United States and boost Trump's chances against Clinton.",
    " Title: California Wildfires Claim 42 Lives, Displace Over 300,000 Residents, and Destroy Thousands of Structures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a grim turn of events, the death toll from the devastating wildfires in California has risen to 42, with 13 more bodies recovered in the hard-hit town of Paradise. The Camp Fire, the largest blaze, has also left at least 228 people missing, and has destroyed nearly 7,200 structures, with another 15,500 at risk.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which started in a nearby forest on Thursday, has surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. In the south of the state, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives, damaged beach resorts, including Malibu, and has destroyed at least 177 buildings. The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained, while the Camp Fire is nearly 25% contained.\n\nThe fires have forced more than 300,000 locals to flee their homes across California. President Donald Trump has declared a \"major disaster\" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents.\n\nParadise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate. One resident, Sorrell Bobrink, described the scene as \"exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen.\"\n\nMany of the victims are believed to be elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Cadaver dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them.\n\nThe fires have burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and are not yet fully contained. The separate Woolsey Fire started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained.\n\nHistorically, California's \"wildfire season\" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes, amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began.\n\nLow humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40 million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas.\n\nCiting the role of a warming climate, Governor Jerry Brown declared, \"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal.\" Thousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes.",
    " Title: Political Figures Discuss Impeachment Proceedings and the Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews, several high-profile political figures have expressed their views on the ongoing investigation and the potential for impeachment proceedings against the current president.\n\nOne individual, when asked about the investigation's findings, stated, \"I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted, which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.\"\n\nAnother individual, in response to the same question, said, \"If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail. If there is going to be any accountability, that accountability has to come from the Congress, and the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process.\"\n\nHowever, when asked about the immediate need for impeachment proceedings, one individual responded, \"No. I think right now, we should continue this investigation. I think Mueller should come before and testify. I don't think we should be having that conversation.\"\n\nThe interviewee further elaborated, \"Congress has got to take a hard look at that, and do a hard investigation and ask \u2014 subpoena the people who were mentioned in that report and bring them forward so to get to the truth. Did Trump actually obstruct justice?\"\n\nAnother individual, when asked about the president's potential impeachment, said, \"I think he's made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment. I'll leave it to the \u2014 [applause] but I'm also going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out because my role in the process is trying to relegate Trumpism to the dustbin of history.\"\n\nThe final interviewee, a senator, stated, \"The impeachment proceedings are up to the House. They're going to have to make that decision. I am in the Senate, and I believe that we are the jury. So, if the House brings the impeachment proceedings before us, we will deal with them.\"\n\nThese statements reflect a divided political landscape, with some calling for immediate impeachment proceedings and others advocating for further investigation. The future of these proceedings remains uncertain, with the House yet to make a decision on whether to initiate impeachment proceedings. The American public will likely have a chance to weigh in on this matter at the November 2020 elections.",
    " Title: \"Minneapolis Riots: A Call for Police Reform and Self-Policing\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent riots in Minneapolis, as depicted in a photograph showing a young man wielding a hammer against a looted Target store, have sparked a conversation about destruction, political protests, and the root of unruliness. While the act of destroying property is wrong and often self-defeating, the visceral appeal of such actions cannot be ignored.\n\nThe satisfaction of destruction is not confined to any particular race or class. If given the opportunity, children from the wealthiest, whitest parts of the Twin Cities would likely participate in such acts of vandalism. Riots occur due to the initial violence granting a kind of permission to indulge the primal urge to destroy.\n\nThe time to stop a riot is before it happens, through prevention. The United States, nearly six years after Ferguson and close to 55 years after the Watts riots in Los Angeles, has yet to implement the obvious preventive measure of consistent, top-to-bottom police reform.\n\nPolice officers deserve gratitude and respect when they do their jobs well, but they cannot maintain law and order if they cannot police themselves first. The public has the right to expect police to discipline themselves and their colleagues.\n\nThe recent incident involving the death of George Floyd, filmed by a bystander, has drawn widespread condemnation from police departments across the country. The apathy displayed by the officers at the scene raises questions about the cultural rot within the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nFour officers involved in the incident have been fired, and the kneeling officer has been charged with third-degree murder. However, this is not enough. The entire department must examine why these individuals fit into its culture. Why did Officer Derek Chauvin think he could commit such a heinous act without consequence? Why did three fellow officers stand by and let it happen?\n\nThe Minneapolis police union should reconsider whether dues should be used to hire lawyers for bad cops. The four fired officers are shielded behind a wall of silence, patrolled by expensive lawyers. This omerta speaks volumes about the real values at work: job protection matters more than character.\n\nMinneapolis must also question why this department was ever acceptable to the community. Relations between police and citizens of color have been strained for years, with only one in every 100 citizen complaints leading to disciplinary action. Why have voters tolerated this?\n\nThe spread of protests to cities far from Minneapolis signifies that genuine police reform remains an unfinished coast-to-coast endeavor. The public must demand it, but only the police can achieve it, by rooting out, rather than covering for, the bad cops in their midst.\n\nWith sincere and sustained commitment, and with energy and pride, future riots can be prevented. Continued failure to address the issue will only unleash more anarchy and mayhem, as justified protests boil over into senseless, visceral violence.",
    " Title: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Youth Activists Clash Over Green New Deal in Heated Exchange\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) clashed with a group of youth activists over the Green New Deal, a 10-year plan to address climate change. The confrontation took place during a meeting in Feinstein's office, where the senator criticized the activists' requests that she back the Green New Deal, accused them of presenting an ultimatum, and contrasted their inability to vote with her three decades in office.\n\nThe exchange comes as moderate Democrats grapple with the Green New Deal, a proposal championed by progressive lawmakers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Sen. Feinstein stated, \"There's no way to pay for it,\" and added, \"I don't agree with what the resolution says. That's part of it.\"\n\nWhen a girl urged her to vote yes anyway, Feinstein replied, \"I may do that... but it's not a good resolution.\" In a statement Friday night, Feinstein said she \"always welcomes the opportunity to hear from Californians who feel passionately about this issue\" and remains committed to enacting meaningful climate change legislation.\n\nThe conversation at times grew heated, especially when Feinstein dismissed the group's request due to their tone and their youth. A young woman told Feinstein she \"is looking at the faces of the people who will be living with these consequences\" of climate change. Feinstein responded, \"I've been doing this for 30 years. I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nThe senator also asked a girl how old she was as the girl said politicians should listen to the people they represent. The girl replied that she was 16. Later, a young woman stressed the need for a climate plan with \"bold, transformative action,\" and Feinstein replied, \"Well, you know better than I do.\"\n\nAs the meeting concluded, a woman urged the children to read a letter aloud. Once most of the children exited, several women stayed and calmly chatted with Feinstein. One of them said voting to support the deal is important even though it \"isn't something that's aimed at passing right now.\" The 16-year-old inquired about internship opportunities in Feinstein's office.\n\nThe Green New Deal, which aims to transition the U.S. economy to 100% clean and renewable energy, has faced criticism from some Democrats who argue that it is too ambitious and lacks specifics. The proposal has also faced opposition from Republicans, who argue that it would be too costly and would require significant government intervention in the economy.\n\nSen. Feinstein's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Analysis of the 2012 DNC's Second Night: A Closer Look at the Speeches and Performances\n\nArticle:\n\n-Introduction-\n\nThe second night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, concluded with a speech from former President Bill Clinton. The evening, however, was preceded by a series of speeches that were met with mixed reactions.\n\n-Sandra Fluke's Speech-\n\nSandra Fluke, a recent law graduate, delivered a speech that was met with criticism for its surly and self-pitying tone. Fluke, who gained notoriety for her demand that her Catholic school be compelled to pay for her birth control, portrayed herself as a courageous victim. Her demagoguery about women's health under a potential Romney/Ryan administration was deemed unseemly, crass, and unappealing to the average person.\n\n-Jim Sinegal's Speech-\n\nJim Sinegal, the former CEO of Costco, spoke about the benefits of Democratic policies for businesses. His speech was dull and unmemorable, making it difficult to offer a meaningful analysis.\n\n-Elizabeth Warren's Speech-\n\nElizabeth Warren, the Harvard Law professor, led the class warfare fight, as she is known to do. Her message was characteristic and reprehensible, calling for increased government investment in various sectors. Despite her improved delivery and smile, her message was met with criticism for its counter-productive nature.\n\n-Bill Clinton's Speech-\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton delivered a speech that was generally well-received. Clinton made a compelling case for Obama's re-election, emphasizing the challenges he faced upon taking office, his accomplishments, and his character. However, Clinton's speech was criticized for its length, with some arguing that it could have been more effective if it had been shorter.\n\n-Odds and Ends-\n\nThe media is eager to move past the floor debacle that occurred earlier in the day, and will likely focus on Clinton's salvaging of the 10pm hour and the convention as a whole. Clinton's star power and strong endorsement certainly helped Obama, but the rest of the night was met with mixed reactions.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation of Hillary Clinton's Email Practices: A Closer Look at the Special Access Program (SAP) Email Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation of Hillary Clinton's email practices by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has taken a new turn with the revelation of a Special Access Program (SAP) email found on her private server. This development, along with the discovery of state secrets cut and pasted on her server and her BlackBerry, is likely to intensify calls for the FBI to recommend an indictment for Clinton on charges of espionage.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe FBI's investigation into Clinton's legal woes can be broadly categorized into two areas: her handling of state secrets and her potential use of her position as Secretary of State to financially benefit her husband's charitable foundation. The following details the state secrets aspect of the investigation.\n\nThe FBI has uncovered a top-secret email, classified as SAP, on Clinton's server. SAP is the most sensitive sub-part of top-secret state secrets, and it is so classified that it cannot be received or opened accidentally. Clinton, who received all her governmental emails through her husband's server, could only have received or viewed the SAP email after inputting specific codes.\n\nThe presence of the SAP-denominated email on her private server, whether opened or not, indicates a criminal indifference to her legal obligation to safeguard state secrets. Clinton's assertion of digital ineptitude, suggesting she may not have known what she was doing, is an attempt at plausible deniability. However, in this sensitive area of the law, plausible deniability is not a valid defense.\n\nFailure to safeguard state secrets is a crime that does not require proof of intent, and plausible deniability is actually an admission of negligence, not a denial. Furthermore, Clinton signed an oath under penalty of perjury on her first full day as Secretary of State, acknowledging that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawful care and keeping of state secrets.\n\nData protected by the SAP denomination includes the most sensitive information, such as the names of moles (spies working for multiple governments), their American handlers, the existence of black ops (illegal programs the U.S. government carries out), codes needed to access state secrets, and ongoing intelligence-gathering projects.\n\nThe crime occurs when SAPs are exposed by residing in a nonsecure venue; it does not matter for prosecution purposes whether they fall into the wrong hands. Clinton's persistent mocking of the seriousness of these issues is akin to taunting alligators before crossing a stream.\n\nShortly after the presence of the SAP-denominated email was made known, the State Department released another email Clinton failed to erase, wherein she instructed her subordinates to take state secrets from a secure venue, cut and paste and summarize them, and send them to her on her nonsecure device. Such an endeavor, if carried out, is a felony\u2014masking and then not safeguarding state secrets.\n\nEqually telling is a little-known 2013 speech by one of Clinton's former subordinates, revealing that Clinton and her staff regularly engaged in digital conversations about state secrets on their BlackBerries. This is not criminal if the BlackBerries were government-issued and secured. Clinton's was neither.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that Clinton has failed to safeguard state secrets. If her name were Hillary Rodham instead of Hillary Rodham Clinton, she would have been indicted months ago. The FBI's decision on whether to recommend an indictment will soon shed light on the state of the rule of law in America.",
    " Title: Romney Kicks Off Six-State Bus Tour in Pennsylvania, Focuses on Middle-Class Voters and Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, embarked on a six-state bus tour over the weekend, starting in Pennsylvania's conservative heartland. The tour aims to engage undecided voters in battleground states, following President Obama's unexpected announcement to suspend deportation for hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants.\n\nDuring a visit to the Weatherly Casting and Machine Company, Romney highlighted a local entrepreneur who took out a second mortgage to start a business that now employs about 110 people. \"Let's put America back to work again with those kinds of dreams,\" Romney said. \"I'm optimistic about the future.\"\n\nThe tour, which began in New Hampshire on Friday, will also take Romney to Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. The candidate's second stop in Pennsylvania, at a Wawa convenience store in Quakertown, was relocated due to a counter rally organized by former Democratic Governor Ed Rendell.\n\n\"I was asked... why we're at this Wawa, instead of the other Wawa,\" Romney told a reporter. \"I understand I had a surrogate over there already. So we decided to pick a different place. My surrogate is former Gov. Rendell, who said we could win Pennsylvania. I'm happy to hear that, so we're happy to be here and see some folks here.\"\n\nThe final stop in Pennsylvania will be an old iron furnace in Cornwall, now a national historic landmark.\n\nIn response to President Obama's announcement, Romney stated that an executive order makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult. \"If I'm elected president, we'll do our best to have the long-term solution,\" he said.\n\nThe response was softer than Romney's previous stance during the GOP primary campaign, where he called the DREAM Act a \"handout\" and threatened to veto it if elected president.\n\nThe bus tour, which involves Romney flying each night to the next state and traveling during the day, marks his first traditional campaign. Romney was joined in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania by former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker will join the tour when it reaches Wisconsin. Both are considered potential vice presidential candidates.\n\nNo Republican has won Pennsylvania since 1988. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain won two of the counties Romney plans to visit. The last time Romney was in Pennsylvania, he was campaigning with Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and discussing the Cuban-American's ideas for legislation that would allow some illegal immigrants to stay in the country to work.\n\nRomney faces pressure to appeal to Hispanic voters, who are crucial in battleground states like Nevada and Colorado, but risks alienating his conservative base if he abandons his previously tough stances.",
    " Title: Walmart Enters Healthcare Market with Transparent Pricing Model\n\nArticle:\n\nWalmart, the multinational retail corporation, is venturing into the healthcare market with its new \"Walmart Health\" in-store clinic in Dallas, Georgia. The new facility offers primary medical, dental, vision, and mental health care services. While Walmart has not announced plans for a national rollout, the Georgia clinic appears to be a pilot for a new approach to providing basic healthcare to Americans.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the Walmart Health clinic is its transparent pricing model. The company has published a pricing list, detailing the cost of services such as basic check-ups ($30, or $20 for children), flu tests ($20), and routine vision exams ($40). The clinic will be staffed by medical professionals capable of handling a wide range of healthcare services, from immunizations to counseling sessions, lab testing, and X-rays.\n\nWalmart's new healthcare facility is a significant step forward for the company, which is already one of the country's largest pharmacies and operates smaller clinics in 19 stores for flu shots and other basic healthcare services. The new Walmart Health location in Georgia spans over 10,000 square feet, significantly larger than the average 1,500 square feet of the smaller clinics.\n\nThe move towards retail-based healthcare is another example of private-sector innovation in reaching Americans where they live and shop. CVS and Walgreens already offer small-scale clinics in some retail locations, with plans to expand these services in the coming years. If Walmart enters the healthcare provider marketplace, it could lead to increased competition and convenience for consumers.\n\nElise Amez-Droz, a health care policy associate at the Mercatus Center, a think tank based at George Mason University, commented, \"Walmart Health is proof that the private sector can deliver high-quality, transparently priced healthcare services without government intervention. The best way to cater to our varying needs is to let patients have the final say in their healthcare decisions, shopping for better value, and reaping the benefits in the form of better care and savings.\"\n\nAccess to care is an often overlooked aspect of the national healthcare debate, which tends to focus on providing insurance rather than healthcare itself. Insurance is crucial, but it is ineffective if there are no providers nearby. As Amez-Droz notes, the federal government could provide every American with a voucher for the right to live in Manhattan, but that would not change the fact that not everyone could move there (or would want to). Walmart and other retailers are helping to address part of the access issue with these new clinics. About 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store.\n\nWalmart's pricing model could disrupt conventional healthcare pricing as well. Although the retail giant plans to accept most major insurance plans, as it does in its pharmacies and existing, smaller clinics, the low, transparent prices will allow many customers to pay out-of-pocket for basic care. This could potentially change the healthcare landscape, as the lack of transparency in healthcare prices\u2014largely due to third parties, such as insurance companies, serving as intermediaries between consumer and provider\u2014encourages the inflation of healthcare costs and the overconsumption of healthcare.\n\nA single Walmart health clinic on the outskirts of Atlanta will not solve all the problems with the American healthcare system. However, the innovative approach and transparent pricing model could pave the way for more efficient and affordable healthcare services in the future.",
    " Title: Sessions to Testify Before Senate Intelligence Committee Amidst Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Republican Senator Jeff Sessions will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, adding another layer to the ongoing political drama surrounding potential contacts between the Trump administration and Russia. The testimony comes just days after former FBI Director James Comey's explosive testimony, which included comments about a potential third meeting between Sessions and a top Russian official.\n\nComey's remarks have raised questions about Sessions' involvement in the controversy surrounding the Trump campaign and Russia. In his testimony, Comey hinted at a possible third meeting between Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a foreign policy speech Trump gave in April 2016. The Justice Department has denied that such a meeting took place, stating that Sessions did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.\n\nIf a third meeting did occur, it would contradict Sessions' previous assertion that he only met twice with the Russian official during the presidential campaign. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions wrote, \"I do not recall any discussions with the Russian ambassador, or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasions.\"\n\nSessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe will also be a topic of discussion during his testimony. Comey told lawmakers that the FBI expected Sessions to step back from the investigation even before his recusal on March 2. Sessions' recusal reportedly strained his relationship with President Trump, and senators will likely ask Sessions about reports that he offered to resign.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers that he first learned Trump planned to fire Comey during a May 8 meeting with Sessions and the president. He and Sessions also discussed replacing Comey during a meeting last year, months before Comey was fired.\n\nDemocrats argue that Sessions may have violated his pledge to recuse himself from the Russia probe if he was involved in Comey's firing. They are expected to ask Sessions if he knew the president wanted to fire Comey, in part because of the Russia investigation, as Trump has stated publicly.\n\nThe Justice Department has disputed Comey's version of their conversation, stating that the then-FBI director told Sessions that the FBI wanted to make sure it was following the \"proper communications protocol\" and that Sessions \"was not silent.\"\n\nAs the investigation into Russian election meddling continues, Sessions' testimony will provide lawmakers with a chance to hear his side of the story and gain a clearer understanding of his role in the ongoing controversy.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses 2016 Election Polarization, Denies Responsibility for Rise of Donald Trump\n\nIn a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, President Barack Obama extended comments regarding the 2016 election and its unprecedented political polarization.\n\n\"I have been blamed by the Republicans for a lot of things,\" the president said. \"But to be blamed for their primaries and who they are selecting is... novel.\"\n\nHe further stated, \"I\u2019m not going to validate some notion that the Republican crackup that\u2019s been taking place is a consequence of actions that I\u2019ve taken.\"\n\nThe president also addressed the accusations that his administration has contributed to the rise of a provocative candidate like Donald Trump. \"It's not as if there's a massive difference between Mr. Trump's position on immigration and Mr. Cruz's,\" he said. \"Mr. Trump may be more provocative in terms of how he sighs, but they're not that different.\"\n\nWhen asked about his critics pointing to the polarized political climate as under his administration as a contributing factor to the rise of Trump, Obama responded, \"I have been blamed by the Republicans for a lot of things, but to be blamed for their primaries and who they are selecting, that is taking place in their primary is... novel.\"\n\nHe further explained, \"I've said -- I said at the State of the Union that one of my regrets is the degree to which polarization and the nasty tone of our politics has accelerated, rather than waned over the course of the last seven and a half years.\"\n\nObama also acknowledged the role of Republican political elites and media outlets in creating an environment that has allowed a candidate like Trump to thrive. \"That there's a them and us, and it's the them that are causing the problems we're experiencing, and the tone of that politics -- which I certainly have not contributed to -- I have not... prompted questions about my birth certificate, for example,\" he said.\n\nThe president also clarified that he does not feel any responsibility for the protectionist rhetoric from some Democratic candidates and did not provide a timeline for when he may make a presidential endorsement.",
    " Title: Tense Exchange Between Acting Attorney General Whitaker and House Judiciary Committee Chair Nadler Marks Hearing on Mueller Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., engaged in a contentious back-and-forth over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The hearing, which was marked by bickering among committee members, focused on Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller probe during his tenure as acting attorney general while awaiting confirmation of President Trump's attorney general pick William Barr.\n\nThe hearing began with Nadler expressing his intention to question Whitaker in a private deposition after the hearing and asking whether he had been \"asked to approve any requests or action\" for the special counsel. In response, Whitaker, who was voluntarily appearing for the hearing, stated that his five-minute rounds had ended and that he had not interfered in any way with the special counsel's investigation.\n\nAs the hearing progressed, Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers continued to spar over whether he was properly answering questions. At one point, he tussled with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, when she pressed on whether he had appeared before the committee for an oversight hearing. The answer, eventually, was that he had not, but the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a simple \"yes or no.\"\n\nWhen she asked the chairman if her time had been restored, Whitaker responded, \"I don't know whether your time's been restored or not.\" The congresswoman responded, \"Mr. Attorney General, we're not joking here, and your humor is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe fiery back-and-forth followed a dramatic political prelude to the hearing, complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott. Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller probe, and the hearing marked the committee's first major oversight hearing looking at the Justice Department of this Congress.\n\nWhitaker testified that there had been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation and that he never offered any \"promises or commitments\" regarding the Mueller or any other investigation. He also stated that he did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation and had not shared information about the investigation with Trump or any White House officials.\n\nWhitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler's other questions, resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date. Nadler explained that the committee would \"attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers\" so Whitaker can return for \"deposition before the committee, under oath.\"\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, R-Ga., blasted the hearing as a \"dog and pony show.\" Meanwhile, the Mueller deputy testified on Thursday that he was briefed on the anti-Trump dossier research months before the 2016 election. The Senate is close to confirming Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, and the president fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, the day after the 2018 midterm elections. Prior to Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversaw the Russia investigation. Nadler and other Democrats have criticized Whitaker for not recusing himself from the Mueller probe, as Sessions did due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016, as Whitaker had made public comments criticizing the investigation.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Bladensburg Peace Cross, Affirming Constitutionality of Long-Standing War Memorial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 7-2 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a 40-foot Latin cross standing on public park land in Maryland, can remain in place. The court ruled that the cross, which has stood for nearly a century as a war memorial and symbol of community grief, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe case, American Legion v. American Humanist Association, was a test of religious freedom, with both sides of the church-state divide questioning the justices' decision. In his key opinion, Justice Samuel A. Alito stated that the Bladensburg Cross passes constitutional muster, and removing it would show unconstitutional \"hostility\" to religion.\n\nThe cross was erected by the American Legion in 1925 to honor the soldiers who died during World War I, and the design was chosen to mirror the crosses that stood on the graves of the troops. The names of 49 soldiers are engraved at the base of the cross. In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission acquired the land where the cross stands, creating the church-state clash that the cross' opponents raised with the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, who agreed with the main ruling, said the case would have been different if there had been evidence that the American Legion erected the cross in an attempt to disparage or disrespect people in faiths other than Christianity. However, he said there was no evidence of that.\n\nThe ruling is the latest blow to the \"Lemon test,\" the Supreme Court's 1971 framework for deciding religion-state entanglements. In his opinion, Justice Alito suggested that there should be \"a presumption of constitutionality for long-standing monuments\" on public grounds. However, only two other justices joined him in that part of the opinion.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, stating that the Peace Cross is impossible to view as anything other than the chief symbol of Christianity and leaving it on public land \"elevates\" that religion above all others. She suggested moving the cross to another location to solve the religious entanglement.\n\nThe ruling overturns a decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected the cross in a 2-1 decision. Religious liberty advocates hailed the high court's decision as a landmark, while groups that battle public religious displays expressed disappointment. The American Humanist Association, which lost the case, took solace in the court's limited ruling, saying it feared the justices would overturn the Lemon test and pave the way for even broader religious displays by government.",
    " Title: \"New Study Reveals Tendency of Significant Supreme Court Cases to Land at the End of the Term\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that may not come as a surprise to many, a new study published in The Duke Law Journal has found that the Supreme Court tends to decide its most significant cases towards the end of its term, often just before the summer break.\n\nThe study, which considered 7,219 cases from 1946 to 2013, aimed to provide empirical evidence for a phenomenon that is widely observed but difficult to quantify. The question at hand was not whether any particular case is more likely to be decided late in the term, but rather whether big cases are disproportionately likely to come late.\n\nTo define significance, the study employed several measures, including front-page coverage in this newspaper, the number of friend-of-the-court briefs filed, and the frequency of the decision's citation in later Supreme Court opinions. These measures confirmed that significant decisions were indeed disproportionately likely to come in late June.\n\nGeoffrey R. Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago who served as a clerk to Justice William J. Brennan Jr., expressed his surprise at the court's practice. \"I can't think of an instance, certainly during my term, that the court sat on an opinion when it was done,\" he said. \"It's inconceivable.\"\n\nDeanne E. Maynard, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster who served as a law clerk to Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Stephen G. Breyer, offered a simple explanation for the end-of-term crunch for big cases. \"The court uses as much time as they have to decide the really important cases,\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings add to the ongoing debate about the court's decision-making process and the role of human nature in its operations. The results suggest that the court may prioritize high-profile cases towards the end of the term, potentially due to the desire to leave a lasting impact before the summer recess. However, further research is needed to fully understand this trend and its implications.",
    " Title: Trump Warns Iran of Severe Consequences in Late-Night Tweet; Iran Dismisses US Threats Amidst Ongoing Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night tweet on Sunday, President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Iran, stating, \"Iran must NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN.\" The tweet, sent in all capital letters, came in response to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's remarks suggesting that war with Iran would be \"the mother of all wars.\"\n\nRouhani's comments, reported by the Iranian state news agency IRNA, did not rule out peace, but warned, \"Mr. Trump, don't play with the lion's tail, this would only lead to regret.\"\n\nTrump's tweet continued, \"WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!\"\n\nOn Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's tweet, stating that Trump was not inciting a confrontation and that Iran was the one \"inciting anything.\" National Security Advisor John Bolton also supported Trump's statement, saying, \"President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before.\"\n\nIn Iran, government officials avoided knee-jerk responses. Gholamhossein Gharibpour, the head of the voluntary Basij paramilitary force, described Trump's tweet as \"psychological warfare.\" Foaz Izadi, a prominent commentator close to the establishment, suggested that Trump's tweet was aimed at addressing his US base and was a tactic to divert attention from domestic criticism.\n\nTensions between the US and Iran have escalated since Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. The move unraveled a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration and threatened to destabilize Iran's denuclearization program.\n\nIn a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in California, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran's ruling elite of being a \"mafia\" who had amassed vast sums of wealth while allowing their people to suffer. He also accused several Iranian leaders of participating in widespread corruption and repressing human rights.\n\nPompeo's remarks were aimed in part at Iranian Americans and Iranians living in the US. He assured them that the Trump administration shared their dreams for the people of Iran and expressed support for those Iranians who have protested against their government's actions.\n\nAs the US prepares to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran, Pompeo said the country's religious leaders were \"hypocritical holy men\" and accused several by name of participating in widespread corruption. He also said the government had \"heartlessly repressed its own people's human rights, dignity, and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nPompeo's remarks were particularly barbed in his remarks about \"the ayatollahs,\" saying they \"are in on the act, too.\" He said Nasser Makarem Shirazi, the grand ayatollah, had generated more than $100m for himself in illicit trading of sugar; that Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani is worth millions after the government transferred several lucrative mines to his foundation; and that the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has an off-the-books hedge fund, Setad, worth $95bn.\n\nThe US and Iran have a long history of tense relations, and the recent escalation of rhetoric and actions has raised concerns about the potential for conflict. Both sides have issued threats and warnings, but it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold in the coming days and weeks.",
    " Title: Millennial Incomes Stagnant as Compared to Previous Generations, According to New Study\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the advocacy group Young Invincibles reveals that the incomes of millennials have stagnated in comparison to previous generations, with annual wages falling in four out of the top five biggest employment sectors. The study, which uses Census data, found that for Americans between the ages of 25 and 34, annual income earned from wages has decreased in the retail sector by 9.9 percent, in the leisure and hospitality industry by 14.65 percent, in manufacturing by 2.87 percent, and in professional and business services by 4.28 percent. The only exception is the health care sector, where yearly pay has essentially remained flat, increasing by just 0.10 percent.\n\nThe study's authors noted that the hiring climate has been particularly challenging in the past few years, with young people's incomes stagnant even in hot industries where labor shortages are often reported. For those who work in industries that are not experiencing a hiring boom, incomes are down.\n\nIt is important to note that the study measures annual, not hourly, pay, making it difficult to interpret the statistics with depth. The authors of the report could not determine whether young adult incomes are falling because workers are making less per hour or because they are working fewer hours in total. The authors speculate that it is more likely due to the latter, given the post-recession rise in joblessness and part-time employment.\n\nIn comparison to previous generations, the median young adult income is its lowest in inflation-adjusted terms since 1995, at $30,759. This means that millennials are earning as much as Gen Xers, but without the prospect of an Internet-driven economic boom to lift their living standards. The same trend holds true at almost every education level.\n\nIt is worth noting that young adults are not the only demographic whose incomes have been affected by the economic downturn. Middle-aged and older workers are also experiencing a decline in income.\n\nHowever, the study suggests that millennials may be more heavily burdened by debt than previous generations, thanks largely to student loans. While millennials are not exceptionally poorly paid compared to young adults who came before them, they are stretching the same wages to pay off a larger amount of debt.\n\nThe study's authors also analyzed wages for 18-to-24-year-olds, but they caution that it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions without distinguishing between full- and part-time workers in this age group.",
    " Title: U.S. on High Alert as North Korea Threatens Possible Missile Launch, Raising Concerns Over Denuclearization Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a potential escalation of tensions, U.S. officials are on high alert for signs of a possible missile launch from North Korea in the coming days, which has been referred to as a \"Christmas gift\" by officials. A significant launch or nuclear test would mark a breach of North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on missile launches and tests, and could pose a major setback to President Trump's foreign policy goal of getting North Korea back to the negotiating table to eliminate its nuclear weapons.\n\nEarlier this month, the North conducted what U.S. officials say was an engine test, which experts believe may have involved an engine for a long-range missile. Anthony Wier, a former State Department official who tracks nuclear disarmament for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, stated, \"North Korea has been advancing. It has been building new capabilities. As long as that continues, they gain new capabilities to try new missiles to threaten us and our allies in new ways.\"\n\nNorth Korea warned of a possible \"Christmas gift\" in early December, stating that the Trump administration was running out of time on nuclear negotiations, and it was up to the U.S. to choose what \"Christmas gift\" it gets from Pyongyang.\n\nVictor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said a review of the possible launch sites in North Korea shows they are \"basically ready to go.\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier this week that the U.S. has heard all the talk of a possible upcoming test around Christmas.\n\nArmy Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Friday that the U.S., Japan, and South Korea are ready to defend against any move by the North. \"We always maintain very high levels of readiness,\" he said.\n\nAt a meeting in Singapore in June 2018, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement that the North \"commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" However, negotiations stalled in February after the U.S. rejected North Korea's demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North's nuclear capabilities.\n\nAccording to the U.S. military, North Korea has launched more than 20 missiles this year, including new types of missiles and a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn 2017, North Korea conducted a torrent of missile tests, including flying two intermediate-range missiles over Japan and threatening to fire those weapons toward the U.S. territory of Guam. It also tested three developmental ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15 that demonstrated the potential range to reach deep into the U.S. mainland.\n\nHowever, those ICBM tests showed no clear sign the North had perfected the technology needed to ensure a warhead could survive atmospheric re-entry. Experts said North Korea needed additional flight tests to determine the reliability and accuracy of its ICBMs and establish a capable re-entry protection system.\n\nNorth Korea's missile tests in 2017 triggered a sharp U.S. reaction. Trump said he would bring \"fire and fury\" to North Korea and exchanged threats of total destruction with its leader. Kim subsequently suspended ICBM and nuclear tests, allowing Trump to tout the move as a foreign policy win.\n\nAs the world waits to see if North Korea will follow through on its \"Christmas gift\" threat, the U.S. and its allies remain vigilant, with the U.S. maintaining a high level of readiness and diplomatic efforts ongoing to find a peaceful resolution to the ongoing nuclear standoff.",
    " Title: China Imposes Tariffs on US Imports, Escalating Trade Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic powerhouses, China has imposed tariffs of up to 25% on 128 US imports, including pork and wine. The new tariffs, affecting approximately $3 billion (\u00a32.1 billion) of imports, took effect on Monday.\n\nBeijing justified the move as a safeguard for its interests and a response to the new US tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports implemented in March by President Donald Trump. China had previously stated that it did not wish for a trade war but would not stand idly by if its economy was negatively impacted.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has maintained that \"trade wars are good\" and that the US should easily win one. The US authorities have already announced plans for further targeted tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, in response to what they deem as unfair trading practices that affect US companies.\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the two nations has its roots in China's alleged theft of foreign intellectual property. According to Washington, if international companies wish to operate in China, they must surrender their intellectual property, thereby transferring technology to Chinese engineers, as seen in the case of German high-speed rail technology.\n\nHowever, the implementation of China's retaliatory tariffs has sparked debate, with some expressing concern that a potential tariff war is not the solution to the intellectual property issue. Others argue that China has been taking advantage of this practice for years, and drastic measures are necessary to compel change.\n\nThe imbalance in US-China trade, with a large Chinese surplus, means that China may be more vulnerable during a trade war than the US. As a result, Beijing is likely to seek a negotiated resolution to this escalating tariff standoff.\n\nChina's initial tariffs are relatively mild, but they are a response to the first round of US tariffs, with a second round already announced. American companies in various sectors, including agriculture and manufacturing, are at risk of being targeted. Furthermore, other nations, particularly those in Europe and Asia, could potentially be drawn into this conflict.\n\nUS exports of aluminum and frozen pork will be subject to a 25% additional tariff, on top of existing duties. Several other American food products, including nuts, fresh and dried fruit, ginseng, and wine, will face a 15% increase. Rolled steel bars will also see a 15% rise in duties.\n\nChina's Ministry of Commerce stated that the new tariffs were a retaliatory measure in response to Trump's decision to raise duties on steel and aluminum imports. On March 22, the US announced plans to impose duties on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and limit its investment in the US, in response to years of alleged intellectual property theft. The White House claimed it was acting to counter unfair competition from China's state-led economy.\n\nIt remains to be seen if China will escalate its response with stronger measures, such as taxing US tech companies like Apple, which could force US tech giants to raise their prices to compensate.",
    " Title: US President Obama Urges Calm in Ferguson After Shooting Incident Sparks Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, US President Barack Obama has called for calm and reflection. In a statement, he described the incident as heartbreaking and urged the community to remember Brown through reflection and understanding.\n\nThe unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has resulted in dozens of arrests, shop lootings, and the use of tear gas by police over the past two nights. However, on Tuesday night, anger seemed to give way to reflection at a community forum.\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon, addressing a packed crowd at Christ the King United Church of Christ, described the shooting as reopening an old wound. Ferguson's mayor and police chief were also present and were met with applause.\n\nCivil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton appealed for peace, stating that becoming violent in Michael Brown's name would betray the gentle giant he was. Sharpton, flanked by Brown's parents, also emphasized that no one had the right to take Brown's name and \"drag it through the mud.\"\n\nPolice have stated that Brown was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, but witnesses have reported that Brown was unarmed and was shot while he had his arms raised. The identity of the officer who shot and killed Brown remains undisclosed due to death threats on social media, according to police.\n\nProtests during the day on Tuesday were peaceful but tense, following a night of violence where police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a large crowd. On Sunday night, 32 people were arrested after incidents of shop looting, vandalism, and arson.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the shooting, and US Attorney General Eric Holder has stated that the case deserves a \"thorough review.\" The justice department has also sent its community relations team to the area.",
    " Title: The Origins and Evolution of Labor Day: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe unique American holiday, Labor Day, stands out among national holidays due to its relatively recent inception and the cultural significance it has acquired over time. Unlike holidays such as Washington's Birthday (now Presidents Day), Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Memorial Day, Labor Day did not become a national holiday until 1895.\n\nBefore the 1890s, the end of summer was marked by weather changes, often as late as mid-October or early November. However, with the advent of Labor Day, the first Monday in September, the holiday has become synonymous with the unofficial end of summer and the beginning of fall. Additionally, institutions such as community swimming pools typically end their season on Labor Day, despite the possibility of the best summer weather still being ahead. The day after Labor Day also used to signal the first day of the school year, but many states now open their school doors in August.\n\nThe primary advocate for Labor Day was Peter J. McGuire, a figure not widely recognized, even among historians. The son of Irish immigrants, McGuire made his mark as a carpenter and became a leading force behind the trade's unionization. On August 8, 1881, 36 delegates representing carpenters in 11 states came together to form the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, with McGuire serving as the principal administrator. The organization grew from a few members to 70,000 strong by the end of the century.\n\nMcGuire proposed a special day for all workers to break up the long holiday-barren period from July 4 to Thanksgiving. The day would provide workers with leisure time and also allow unions to increase their membership and visibility through parades and demonstrations. McGuire's idea was supported by the UBC, which organized the first Labor Day in New York City on September 5, 1882.\n\nThe establishment of a national Labor Day was delayed until the economic downturn of 1893, which ignited a bitter railway strike in Pullman, Illinois. George M. Pullman, the head of the Pullman Palace Car Company, had built a model town for his employees in 1880. When the economic downturn occurred, Pullman reduced wages, but maintained rents at their current level. After lengthy negotiations, the workers, assisted by the American Railway Union and its leader, Eugene V. Debs, went on strike in May 1894. A month later, the union enacted a boycott of Pullman cars on all American trains. The railroads retaliated by firing union members, and the strike spread to trains across 27 states. The federal government ultimately dispatched troops, and Debs was convicted of violating an injunction issued by the attorney general, serving six months in jail in 1895.\n\nWith public concerns about additional labor strife emerging, legislation establishing a national Labor Day was rushed through both houses of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland in 1894. The holiday was intended to benefit the large number of workers who preferred a day off over a principle (unionism).\n\nIn another twist, neither McGuire nor Debs would serve as rallying leaders for workers on subsequent Labor Days. McGuire's ideas for a loose federation of unions within the United Brotherhood of Carpenters clashed with the rank and file, and in 1901, he was ousted on charges of embezzling union funds. Debs, a Socialist Party candidate for president in five elections, spent additional time in jail for violating the Espionage Act during World War I.\n\nFinally, union leaders in the years after the first national Labor Day were unsuccessful in making the holiday their special day. Labor Day, after all, was not a \"union\" day, but a \"labor\" day, belonging to no single group. Farmers, merchants, physicians, lawyers, and clerks, among others, also labored. There would always be far more of these types than there would be workers carrying union cards.",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Dissatisfaction with Media Coverage Ahead of 100-Day Mark\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday morning, President Donald Trump expressed his discontent with the national media's coverage of his administration's achievements, stating that he has not received enough credit for the successes he has accomplished in his first 100 days in office.\n\n\"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe exact motivation behind the president's tweets remains unclear, whether it was an attempt to pre-empt media criticism or to lower expectations as the benchmark nears. However, it is evident that the White House is preparing for a critical appraisal from the press.\n\nThe first 100 days of a first-term president is often used as a yardstick to measure success and set a roadmap for future policy issues. This tradition dates back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, in 1933, signed 76 pieces of legislation, including 15 major overhauls and new programs during the Great Depression.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer commented, \"It's very clear that he's committed to the conservative principles and agenda that he outlined in the campaign.\"\n\nSince then, the first 100 days has served as a test of a new president's productivity, though none have come close to matching FDR's accomplishments. President Trump had promised significant changes during his first 100 days, including cracking down on illegal immigration, a complete tax overhaul, and the repeal and replace of ObamaCare.\n\nDuring an October 2016 rally, Trump stated, \"You're going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost and it's going to be so easy.\"\n\nRegarding his \"big beautiful wall\" with Mexico, Trump told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in 2015, \"So simple. So simple.\"\n\nExpectations were high, given Trump's promises and the fact he had a Republican-led Congress, but so far, the two branches have not always been on the same page. On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the Trump administration's accomplishments during the first 90 days.\n\n\"Look at the record that he's achieved over these first 90 days,\" Spicer told \u2588\u2588\u2588's \"The First 100 Days.\" \"It's very clear that he's committed to the conservative principles and agenda that he outlined in the campaign.\"",
    " Title: Suspect in YouTube Shooting Cited Unfair Treatment, Censorship by YouTube\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shooter identified by police as the perpetrator of the shooting at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, was reportedly upset with the company due to a perceived lack of payment for videos she posted on the platform, according to her father.\n\nThe shooter has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, 39, of Southern California. Police reported a previous encounter with Aghdam earlier in the day. Ismail Aghdam, her father, reported her missing on Monday after she did not answer her phone for two days. The family received a call from Mountain View police around 2 a.m. Tuesday stating they found Nasim sleeping in a car.\n\nIsmail Aghdam stated he warned the police that his daughter might be headed to YouTube due to her disdain for the company. Mountain View Police spokeswoman Katie Nelson confirmed that officers located a woman by the same name asleep in a Mountain View parking lot Tuesday morning. However, Nelson did not respond to a question about whether police were warned Aghdam might go to YouTube.\n\nAghdam reportedly maintained a personal website alleging that YouTube compensated her unfairly and censored her views. Authorities are still investigating Aghdam's motive, and there are no indications she knew the victims.\n\nIn online postings last month, Aghdam alleged that YouTube tries to \"censor and suppress people who speak the truth.\" She also claimed that YouTube \"stopped everything and now she has no income.\"\n\nA website reportedly belonging to Aghdam contained several screenshots purportedly showing Aghdam's YouTube user account page. The screenshots suggest that at least one of Aghdam's YouTube accounts had been \"de-monetized,\" meaning that she was not earning significant revenue from her uploads to the site.\n\nThe company \"de-monetizes\" some channels for reasons including inappropriate material or having fewer than 1,000 subscribers. Text superimposed on one of the screenshots reads: \"My Revenue for 300,000 Views Is $ 0.10??????\"\n\nThe website also espouses veganism, and includes videos apparently showing animals being skinned and cooked alive. Aghdam's YouTube videos had been removed from the site by Tuesday evening for violating the company's terms of service. Her personal website remained online.\n\nIsmail Aghdam, Nasim's father, told NBC that YouTube \"stopped everything and now she has no income.\"\n\nThe shooting spree left YouTube employees in a state of terror, huddled inside, calling 911, as officers and federal agents swarmed the company's suburban campus sandwiched between two interstates just south of San Francisco.\n\nYouTube employee Dianna Arnspiger stated she was on the building's second floor when she heard gunshots, ran to a window, and saw the shooter on a patio outside. She described the woman as wearing glasses and a scarf and using a \"big huge pistol.\"\n\n\"It was a woman and she was firing her gun,\" Arnspiger said. \"And I just said, 'Shooter!' and everybody started running.\"\n\nShe and others hid in a conference room for an hour while another employee repeatedly called 911 for updates.",
    " Title: Megyn Kelly Grills Trump Spokesperson Katrina Pierson on Candidate's Policy Flip-Flops and Women's Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Thursday's edition of The Kelly File, host Megyn Kelly grilled Donald Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson over the Republican presidential candidate's frequent policy reversals and inconsistent positions on women's issues.\n\nKelly, known for her hard-hitting interviews, confronted Pierson about Trump's changing stances on various topics, including the war in Afghanistan, Obamacare, and abortion.\n\n\"He said the war in Afghanistan was a mistake, then said that was misspeaking,\" Kelly began, \"He said that Obamacare\u2014that he likes the mandate\u2014then said he misspoke there. He said that women should be punished for abortion if abortion's made illegal, and now he said that he misspoke there. What say you?\"\n\nPierson attempted to defend Trump by stating, \"When you're a political candidate for eight months, you are speaking off the cuff\u2014that's actually one of his appeals, that he's not a scripted politician.\"\n\nHowever, Kelly pressed on, asking, \"Then why did he say he did [regarding abortion]?\" and \"His critics say that it shows he has not thought the issue through.\"\n\nPierson countered by accusing the media of being against Trump and trying to stop him from winning the nomination.\n\nKelly then pointed out Trump's low approval ratings among women, stating that during Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid, he had a 51 percent disapproval rate, but still received 44 percent of the votes. \"He was killed in that election,\" she continued. \"How will Trump do better than that with a 73 percent disapproval rate?\"\n\nThe interview ended with Pierson reiterating the anti-Trump movement and the media's alleged bias against the candidate. The exchange highlights the challenges Trump faces in winning over women voters, a demographic he will need to court in order to secure the presidency.",
    " Title: NPR's Omission of State Department's Conclusion on Clinton Email Investigation Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the State Department has concluded its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, as revealed by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley last week. The investigation found \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information,\" according to an Associated Press report. However, 38 current or former employees were found to have sent classified information, some of which ended up in Clinton's personal email, with some of them potentially facing discipline.\n\nDespite the significance of this development, NPR has faced criticism for its lack of coverage, with some viewers and readers expressing concern over the under-reporting of this \"missing story.\" NPR did cover the story in newscasts, but the absence of a digital story or newsmagazine report on NPR.org has left many unaware of this important development.\n\nIn response to this criticism, NPR's newsroom leaders have explained their decision to cover the story only in newscasts, citing the crush of other important news and an exceedingly stretched staff. Edith Chapin, NPR's vice president and executive editor, stated, \"It was a combination of things: timing and stretched resources, and in the scheme of all the news of late, it just didn't rise up to our re-allocating resources.\"\n\nSarah Gilbert, NPR's vice president for news programming, added, \"That part of the week's news agenda was dominated by reaction to [acting White House Chief of Staff Mick] Mulvaney admitting and then retracting quid pro quo on Ukraine, the Doral G7 announcement and reversal, and the crisis in Syria. In this context, newscast coverage of a 9-page State Dept. report that concluded 'there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information' was adequate.\"\n\nWhile the other stories mentioned are indeed important, the State Department's finding may have felt anti-climactic given that the FBI had already closed its own investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, stating there was no criminal act. NPR covered that at the time.\n\nThe individuals most affected by the new development are the senders of the now-classified emails. However, as recently as Sept. 30, NPR had prominent reports in both Morning Edition and All Things Considered about the revival of the probe, contacting about 150 current or former employees whose emails had ended up in Clinton's private email. The net effect of that action, and NPR's reporting on it, was to keep alive an issue that President Trump has used to stir up his supporters against Clinton in particular and Democrats in general.\n\nThe end of the State Department's investigation marks a final period on the whole saga that garnered so much attention in the lead-up to the 2016 election. NPR has an obligation to provide closure after three years, and since there is no other report in the NPR online archive, this one will have to do.",
    " Title: Sen. Marco Rubio and President Trump: A Pragmatic Partnership in the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an unexpected turn of events, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has found himself in a pragmatic partnership with President Donald Trump, guiding the latter's Cuba policy and forging common ground on foreign policy issues. This shift in their relationship was evident on June 16, as Rubio accompanied Trump on a trip to Miami to announce a tough new policy on Cuba, a country his parents once called home.\n\nThe moment, as they flew over the Everglades undergoing a multibillion-dollar restoration, underscored Rubio's ascendant role as a confidant of Trump's. Despite a contentious past, marked by mutual insults during the 2016 campaign, the two have put aside their differences to work together.\n\nRubio, who once called Trump a \"con artist\" and was dubbed \"little\" by the president, seemed to punctuate the divide by not appearing with Trump during Florida visits in the general election campaign. However, the two have since found common ground on issues such as Cuba, China, and Venezuela.\n\nWhen Trump announced his revamped policy toward the Castro regime in June, he expressed his \"deep gratitude\" to Rubio, calling him \"a man who has really become a friend of mine.\" While other Republican senators such as John McCain (AZ), Ben Sasse (NE), and Susan Collins (ME) have openly criticized the president, Rubio has kept a relatively low profile on his criticism of a president who values loyalty.\n\nAt a recent Intelligence Committee hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey, Rubio questioned the volume of leaks stemming from the agency's probe into Russian meddling with the 2016 election. Despite criticism of his aggressive questioning, Rubio defended his actions, stating that he asked questions directly from Comey's written statement.\n\nRubio, who had expressed frustration with the Senate during his presidential campaign, seems to have found a new appreciation for the position since returning to the Senate. He attributes this to having an ally in the Oval Office and the access it provides.\n\n\"Now I come back with six years of experience, access to the White House, a better understanding of how the process works,\" he told CBS 4 Miami in an interview. \"And I feel good about the progress we've made. I'm enjoying and fulfilled by the work we've been doing, and I feel we've got a chance to do some great things in the months to come.\"\n\nBrian Ballard, a Tallahassee-based lobbyist who supported Rubio for president before becoming Trump's state finance chairman, attributes the two men's relationship to a genuine affection for each other that made it easier to get past their verbal volleys.\n\n\"When the election goes the right way, it cures a lot of things,\" he said.\n\nDespite their partnership, Rubio has not shied away from countering Trump's claims, such as his denial of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. He has also voted for a bill to ensure Trump cannot dial back economic sanctions against Moscow without congressional approval. However, Rubio has not gone out of his way to personally criticize the president, aware that his agenda on Florida issues and foreign affairs has a better chance of success with Trump in the White House.\n\n\"If I have an opportunity to influence the administration's policy in a positive direction, I'm going to seek that out,\" he said in a recent interview about human rights.\n\nRubio has been a frequent visitor to the White House, having dined or personally met with Trump or Vice President Pence several times. On Tuesday, he and two other lawmakers met with Pence to discuss geopolitics in the Western Hemisphere in advance of the vice president's trip to the region.\n\n\"I can't think of a more valuable ally the administration has had in the Senate than Marco, especially on issues affecting the Western Hemisphere,\" Ballard said. \"He's been absolutely on point with the president, and, with regards to both Cuba and Venezuela, a leading adviser on those matters. I think the relationship's only going to grow stronger.\"\n\nSo it was no surprise that Rubio quashed any speculation about his own ambitions when a recent article in The New York Times detailed the moves several key Republicans, including Pence, were taking with an eye toward 2020.\n\n\"I'm not thinking about running in any Republican primary,\" he told the Miami TV station. \"I am enjoying my service in the Senate. I think that's a hypothetical that isn't even worth exploring.\"\n\nSusan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa, said it makes no sense for Rubio to even suggest faint interest in a run given that it could endanger his relationship with Trump and complicate his legislative agenda. The senator and the president understand the benefits a partnership has over a rivalry, she said.\n\n\"They each give each other breathing room,\" MacManus said. \"Their relationship is more issue-focused than power-focused, and that makes it easier to have these gives and takes.\"",
    " Title: U.S.-Israeli Relations Strain as Ceasefire Negotiations in Gaza Strip Falter\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States and Israel have escalated as the Israeli operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip enters its third week, with both nations expressing growing concerns over the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives. The latest sign of this strain came Sunday in the form of a White House statement following a call between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe statement, while seemingly dry in language, revealed a palpable tension between the two leaders. \"The President reiterated the United States' serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza,\" said the statement.\n\nThe statement also emphasized the need for an immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire to end hostilities and lead to a permanent end of hostilities. This call for a ceasefire comes amidst Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, efforts that have been openly criticized by some Israeli officials.\n\nThe current tensions can be traced back to the breakdown of the broader peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis, which occurred just days before the discovery of the bodies of three Israeli teenagers, believed to have been killed by Palestinians. While the demise of the peace process is not directly linked to the outbreak of hostilities, American officials believe the breakdown made the situation harder to contain.\n\nOn the Israeli side, officials felt they had no meaningful partner for peace due to the weakness of Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and the extremism of Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, some Israelis viewed the American push for peace as a grandstand play by Secretary Kerry.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel also grappled with the talks between the U.S. and five international powers and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program. As the talks moved towards an agreement that would leave Iran with a continuing capacity to enrich uranium, Israeli discomfort grew. This discomfort intensified when the talks were extended for four more months.\n\nInitially, the U.S. publicly supported Israel's right to strike back when hit by rockets fired from Gaza. However, as Israel moved from an aerial offensive to a ground incursion into Gaza, American and Israeli analyses fell out of sync. U.S. officials began to fear that the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians were stirring up enough anger in the Gaza Strip and West Bank to put the longer-term U.S. quest for peace out of reach for a long time.\n\nThis diplomatic dance is not occurring in a vacuum. Israelis consider Hamas a problem, but they regard Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. These nuclear talks with Iran are set to resume soon, and American officials are not optimistic about reaching a long-term deal. This is why more tensions likely lie ahead.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Proposes Expanded Social Media Information Collection for Visa Applicants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in visa application procedures, the U.S. government has proposed collecting social media identities from the majority of individuals seeking entry into the United States, according to a State Department filing on Friday. This proposal, pending approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), would require most immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants to list all social media identities they have used in the past five years.\n\nThe information gathered will be utilized for vetting and identification purposes, as stated in the proposals, which would affect approximately 14.7 million people annually. The move is in line with President Donald Trump's campaign promise to implement \"extreme vetting\" of foreigners entering the United States to prevent terrorism.\n\nPreviously, under rules instituted last May, consular officials were instructed to collect social media identifiers only when deemed necessary to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting. The tighter vetting was to apply only to those \"who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has expressed concern, stating that the move could have a \"chilling\" effect on freedom of speech and association. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said in a statement, \"People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.\"\n\nThe new proposal was published in the Federal Register on Friday, allowing the public 60 days to comment on the revised procedures before the OMB approves or rejects them. If approved, the measures will also require applicants to submit five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, and their international travel history. They will be asked if they have been deported or removed from any country and whether family members have been involved in terrorist activities, the department said.\n\nThe department stated that it does not intend to routinely ask most diplomatic and official visa applicants for the additional information.",
    " Title: US-Russia Syria Peace Conference Prospects Dim as Assad Expresses Confidence in Receiving Russian Missiles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe prospects for the Syria peace conference, which the US and Russia had hoped to jointly sponsor in Geneva, have taken a turn for the worse. The announcement of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's confidence in receiving sophisticated Russian anti-aircraft missiles and the insistence of a key Syrian opposition group to not attend the proposed conference have cast a shadow over the diplomatic initiative.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the US remains committed to the Syria peace conference as a key goal, a critical component of the Obama administration's \"two-track\" Syria policy, which involves seeking a political settlement to the conflict while supporting the opposition fighting against Assad.\n\nSome regional experts suggest that the US is playing into Russia's game plan by agreeing to co-sponsor peace talks that appear to have little chance of success, forestalling a more robust US intervention in Syria. The US, however, has rejected this notion, with State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki stating that the US expects to move forward on the conference.\n\nSenior US diplomats will meet next week in Geneva with Russian and UN officials to continue planning for the conference. Some officials speculate that what was originally envisioned for May could now slip into July.\n\nRussia's decision to deliver sophisticated weaponry to Assad while working with the US and the United Nations on a peace conference has raised questions. Psaki declined to speculate on Russia's motivations, but acknowledged that Russia has shown a willingness to help plan the conference and bring parties to the table.\n\nThe US's critics argue that the White House is allowing itself to be played by the Russians, whose main interest they say is to avoid the kind of decisive intervention the US and other Western powers undertook in Libya in 2011.\n\nThe Syrian main opposition group, the National Coalition, announced Thursday in Geneva that it would not take part in any negotiations as long as Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Iran are in Syria fighting for the Assad regime. The opposition group's ultimatum follows Assad's interview on Hezbollah-owned Al Manar television in Lebanon, where he expressed confidence in receiving Russian missiles and issued pointed warnings aimed at Israel.\n\nThe conflict's death toll is on a path to cross the 100,000 threshold next month, amplifying calls for President Obama to intervene more directly in the conflict. If the conflict proves to not be \"ripe\" for a negotiated settlement, pressure will grow for lethal measures.",
    " Title: Former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig Faces Trial Over Alleged False Statements in Ukraine Work\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Obama White House counsel Greg Craig will go on trial on Monday, charged with making false statements related to his work on behalf of Ukrainian interests. The trial, which will take place in the District of Columbia, stems from Craig's work during the Obama administration and is one of several cases to emerge from the Mueller investigation that alleges violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\n\nCraig, a prominent attorney in Democratic political circles who has worked for two Democratic presidents, was indicted in April on two counts of providing false statements to the Justice Department regarding his Ukraine work. A judge presiding over the case dismissed one of those counts last week, but Craig will still face trial on the remaining count.\n\nThe case against Craig, who has pleaded not guilty, was born out of the investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller. During its investigation, Mueller's team uncovered evidence of alleged wrongdoing by Craig, which they referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia for prosecution.\n\nFARA requires that individuals doing political or public relations work in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity disclose that fact. It is illegal to willfully not register or to provide false or misleading statements to the Justice Department's FARA unit.\n\nIn Craig's case, prosecutors allege that he withheld information that he should have provided to the department and provided other information that he knew was incorrect. Craig's lawyers, William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy of the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, have denied that Craig broke the law. In a statement at the time of the indictment, they called the government's prosecution \"a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nThe case against Craig dates back to work he and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, did for Ukraine's pro-Russian government in 2012. Paul Manafort, who was advising the government in Kiev at the time, helped hire Craig and Skadden to draw up a report on the government's prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nManafort, who later became Trump's campaign chairman in 2016 before quitting the post amid questions about his Ukraine work, was later convicted in a bank and tax fraud trial in Virginia brought by Mueller's team. Internationally, the case against Tymoshenko was viewed as a politically motivated sham pushed by her rival, then-President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nAfter being brought on board, Skadden drew up a report that validated the Tymoshenko prosecution. Craig then allegedly briefed journalists to shape early international coverage of the report. Craig and Skadden, however, did not register their activities with the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors say Craig did not register his work with the Justice Department in order to avoid disclosing that Craig and Skadden had been paid $4 million for the work. Publicizing that fact would have undermined the perceived independence and credibility of the report, prosecutors say.\n\nEarly this year, Skadden reached a settlement of its own with the Justice Department, allowing it to avoid prosecution. It agreed to register under FARA and pay about $4.6 million. Craig's trial is expected to last 2 1/2 weeks, with jury selection beginning on Monday.",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies Statement on Trump's Payment to Stormy Daniels, Denies Election Law Violation\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - In a statement issued on Friday, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, clarified his remarks regarding a $130,000 payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Giuliani stated that the payment was not a violation of federal election law, describing it as a personal settlement to protect the President's family.\n\nGiuliani's statement comes after he connected the payment, made by the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, to the election, raising the possibility that the transaction could have violated election law. In a brief statement, Giuliani stated, \"There is no campaign violation. The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President's family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\"\n\nIn a TV interview on Thursday, Giuliani had suggested that if Daniels' claim of an affair had come up in a debate between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, the transaction would have been handled by Cohen. However, in comments to reporters at the White House before boarding a helicopter, President Trump seemed to undercut Giuliani, stating, \"Rudy is a great guy, but he just started a day ago. But he really has his heart into it. He's learning the subject matter.\"\n\nGiuliani late on Wednesday revealed that Trump had repaid Cohen for the $130,000 the lawyer had provided to Daniels. Trump previously had denied knowing about the payment. On Friday, Trump said on Twitter that Cohen was paid back through a monthly retainer, not campaign funds, to stop Daniels' \"false and extortionist accusations.\"\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Giuliani said, \"My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters,\" but did not provide specifics.\n\nGiuliani also addressed the controversy surrounding his statement that Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last year because Comey declined to state publicly that Trump was not at the time a target of the agency's investigation into Russia's role in the election. In his Friday statement, Giuliani said it was \"undisputed\" that Trump had the constitutional power to fire Comey and that doing so has turned out to be \"plainly in the best interests of our nation.\"\n\nPresident Trump, facing legal troubles on several fronts, also indicated he would be willing to be interviewed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, but only if he knew he would be treated fairly. Mueller is probing potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the investigation. Trump stated, \"I have to find that we're going to be treated fairly, because everybody sees it now, and it is a pure witch hunt.\"",
    " Title: Obama and McConnell Agree to Collaborate, but Differences Remain on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have agreed to collaborate on two key areas: trade and tax reform. However, the two leaders' statements on Wednesday indicate that their working relationship may still be shaky.\n\nAt separate press conferences, both Obama and McConnell emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation, but their words revealed underlying differences on several contentious issues.\n\nObama and McConnell have discussed the possibility of finding common ground on trade and tax reform. The President even suggested a willingness to engage in social activities with McConnell, such as drinking Kentucky bourbon and playing golf, to improve their relationship.\n\nHowever, the President made it clear that the next move is up to McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner. \"What I'd like to do is hear from the Republicans to find out what they'd like to see happen,\" Obama said at the White House.\n\nMcConnell, on the other hand, criticized Obama's executive actions on immigration reform, stating that such actions would be like \"waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" He also vowed to continue fighting Obama's signature healthcare law and to move forward with the Keystone pipeline, another nonstarter for the President.\n\nThe President, in response, emphasized his support for a minimum wage increase, stating that minimum wage initiatives passed in five states on Tuesday and arguing that \"I think it would be hard to say that people don't support it.\"\n\nThe election results, with the GOP's sweeping victories, have set up a debate within the party about whether to focus on governing or to engage in as many fights as possible, settling them in the 2016 presidential election. McConnell has stated that there will be no government shutdown or default on the national debt, but he also indicated that the Senate will send Obama bills he's likely to veto.\n\nRepublican leaders have called for the party to work with Obama to get things done, while conservative elements within the party continue to push for the repeal of Obamacare and other nonstarters. The party will have to manage this balance by putting out its own governing agenda, working with Obama where they can, and taking the bigger fights to the voters in 2016.\n\nAs the two leaders move forward, they will also have to navigate their own internal tensions, with conservative activists pushing for big fights with Obama and the GOP Senate doing everything it can to repeal Obamacare, fight regulations, and hold the line against immigration reform.",
    " Title: Sen. Jeff Flake Expresses Willingness to Support Expanded Background Checks for Guns, Conditions Apply\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - Republican Senator Jeff Flake has expressed his willingness to reverse his opposition to expanding background checks for guns, provided that the Senate bill's sponsors make changes to a provision dealing with internet sales.\n\nFlake, who represents Arizona, voted against the bill last month due to concerns about the cost and inconvenience of the current requirement for background checks on internet sales, particularly in rural areas where informal gun transactions among friends are common.\n\nThe senator stated that under the current measure, a casual exchange of guns via text, email, or social media platforms could be considered a commercial sale, making it inconvenient and costly for rural residents.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), the bill's chief sponsor, may find it challenging to amend the language to Flake's satisfaction. However, Flake expressed hope that they can find a solution.\n\nThe legislation, if passed, would have expanded the requirement for background checks on internet sales and private sales at gun shows.\n\nCurrently, the Senate Democratic leadership does not anticipate reaching a deal on background checks before the bill is reconsidered during this work period, which ends before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nSen. Flake, a first-term senator, has been a target of gun control group protests during the recent congressional recess. His stance on the issue has been criticized by gun control advocates, including former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was publicly critical of his decision to vote against expanded background checks.\n\nFlake, however, has dismissed fears that expanding background checks would lead to a national gun registry. \"I know that is not what this bill does, just the opposite,\" Flake said.\n\nDespite facing criticism and being labeled as the most unpopular senator in the country, Flake reported receiving positive feedback from his constituents for his stance on the background check measure as it was written.\n\n\"I'm comfortable with where I am, pond scum or not,\" Flake said with a smile.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts to Avert Sequestration Cuts and Achieve Budget Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the $85 billion in sequestration cuts that took effect on Friday, top Democrats and Republicans have expressed a shared disdain for the spending reductions but have kept open the possibility of a comprehensive budget deal. Both parties have identified the opportunity to negotiate a \"big deal,\" addressing contentious issues such as entitlement reform and tax code overhaul, which have eluded Washington for the past two years.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) emphasized the need for leadership to achieve such a deal, stating, \"We can do the big deal if we have some leadership. I'm not going to do any more small deals.\" Graham, like most other Republicans, has ruled out tax rate hikes as a solution to the sequestration crisis, but he is open to a major agreement that would generate approximately $600 billion in revenue by closing tax loopholes and eliminating deductions. This revenue could then be directed towards reforming Medicare and other entitlement programs.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-IL), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, also acknowledged the opportunity for compromise, stating, \"We have to agree how to finish the [fiscal] year. It creates an opportunity for us to sit down, the president and congressional leaders, and come up with an answer that is sensible.\"\n\nThe two sides have until the end of March to reach a deal, as the resolution funding federal government operations expires at that time, potentially leading to another showdown to avoid a Washington shutdown. Both parties are bracing for additional budget battles, with Congress needing to approve another short-term spending plan by March 27 to avoid a government shutdown, and another debate over the debt ceiling looming in May.\n\nTop Republicans in the House and Senate have reiterated their opposition to further tax increases, with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-OH) stating, \"The president got his tax hikes on January the 1st. The issue here is spending. Spending is out of control.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) echoed these sentiments, stating, \"No Republican is willing to raise a dime in taxes to turn off the sequester.\"\n\nThe top Republican lawmakers' comments come after the White House indicated a willingness to bypass GOP leadership in the House and Senate. National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling, who appeared on multiple Sunday morning shows, stated that the president spent part of Saturday calling lawmakers directly in an attempt to break the sequestration logjam and find a deal. Sperling also criticized Republicans for what the White House perceives as an unwillingness to compromise on the revenue question.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan appeal, even Mitt Romney, the Republican Party's vanquished 2012 presidential nominee, urged President Obama and congressional leaders to find a lasting solution. The stakes are high, as Congress must approve another short-term spending plan by March 27 or face a government shutdown, and another debate over the debt ceiling looms in May.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election Breaks Fundraising Records, Exceeding $70 Million in Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming gubernatorial recall election in Wisconsin, a record-breaking amount of funds has been raised, with a projected total of $70 million to $80 million. This surpasses the previous record of $37 million set just 18 months ago when Republican Governor Scott Walker was first elected.\n\nAccording to Mike McCabe, who runs Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog group, the money raised in the recall already shatters Wisconsin's record. McCabe, sitting in his Madison office surrounded by workers entering a continuous stream of fund-raising data onto his group's website, stated, \"This is way out of proportion to a state this size.\"\n\nWalker has raised 7\u00bd times that of his Democratic challenger, Tom Barrett. To date, Barrett has raised just under $4 million, while Walker has pulled in $30.5 million. This significant disparity can be attributed in part to a quirk in the election law. Public officials in Wisconsin who are targeted for a recall are allowed to raise unlimited sums of money until the recall is formally set. In Walker's case, that was March.\n\nA large portion of Walker's donations in the last month came from outside Wisconsin, with 70% of his contributions coming from outside the state. This influx of funds has been fueled by wealthy Republicans viewing the Wisconsin recall battle as a preview of the presidential race. Notable contributors include Texan Bob Perry, who bankrolled the infamous 2004 \"Swift Boat\" attacks against John Kerry, and Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Michigan millionaire Dick DeVos, each of whom donated $250,000.\n\nThe influx of funds is not limited to individual contributions. Outside groups supporting both candidates have flooded the state with some $25 million. These groups, such as Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association, represent a who's who of Washington special interests. When the dollars are tallied up in this category, Democratic outside groups supporting Barrett will have outspent those backing Walker.\n\nLabor unions, which have a significant stake in the recall due to the backlash against Walker's actions regarding collective bargaining rights for public employees, have given $8 million in traceable donations to help Barrett. It's likely unions have given much more to Democratic groups not required to disclose their donors.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association is another significant contributor, with at least $9 million, including $1 million from GOP high roller David Koch. These groups register and advertise with names that appear to be homegrown, but many are actually funded by national unions or special interests.\n\nAnother factor in the large amount of funds raised is the use of stealth super PACs, whose donors are anonymous. They have given $8.5 million, with the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign listing eight such groups on its website. Most, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth, are groups on the right trying to help Walker. One, Greater Wisconsin Committee, is trying to help push Walker out.\n\n\"Elections are being poisoned here, but the people of Wisconsin can't know who is paying for most of the poison,\" McCabe said. The irony is that despite the tens of millions raised and spent on the recall election, it is an open question whether it will make a real difference. Wisconsin's electorate is so polarized that public and party polls suggest most people's minds are already made up. What both parties agree on, however, is that the extra campaign cash does help where it matters most: identifying voters and making sure they get to the polls on Election Day.",
    " Title: Sperling Hopes for Permanent End to Government Debt Ceiling Impasse as Boehner Allows Vote Without Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nGene Sperling, director of President Obama's National Economic Council, expressed optimism Tuesday following House Speaker John Boehner's decision to allow a vote to increase the government's borrowing cap without attaching conditions sought by some Republican legislators.\n\nDuring a breakfast meeting with reporters, Sperling, who is set to leave the White House next month after serving as National Economic Council director in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, expressed hope that the tactic of threatening default or the full faith and credit of the United States for budget debates is no longer a viable option.\n\n\"We as a country have now reached a consensus that... the tactic of threatening default or threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for budget debates is over, off the table, and never to happen again,\" Sperling said. If the possibility of a government financial default is no longer part of the debate over the debt ceiling, \"that would, I think, be a boost for confidence and long-term investment in the United States,\" Sperling added.\n\nBoehner's decision to allow a vote on the debt ceiling, as soon as Tuesday evening, with no legislative strings attached, marks a departure from the plan he outlined Monday evening, which linked raising the debt ceiling to reversing a measure that cut pension benefits to younger military retirees. Now, \"we'll let the Democrats put the votes up,\" the speaker said Tuesday morning. \"We'll put a minimum number of [GOP] votes up to get it passed.\"\n\nThe change in Boehner's plan came after conservative House Republicans expressed dissatisfaction with the linkage in his plan. Repealing the pension measure would have cost $7 billion over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\"Right now we've got a debt-ceiling bill that increases spending, which is diametrically 180 degrees opposite of what we were battling over just two years ago \u2013 where the question was how much in spending cuts we were going to get,\" Rep. Mo Brooks (R) of Alabama told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Obama administration is \"supportive of efforts to grandfather current recipients\" of the pension benefits, Sperling said. However, the White House is opposed to \"ransom\" to pass the debt limit, he added.\n\nSperling is the first person to serve two presidents as director of the National Economic Council. Asked to compare his service in the Clinton and Obama administrations, he stressed the differences in the Republican Party then and now.\n\n\"In the Clinton administration, what was often most difficult was having [to go up against] a unified and strong opposition,\" Sperling said. \"This time around, you learn the challenges of having a divided opposition when you want to get things done.\" Even when parts of the opposition leadership today want to reach a budget agreement, \"it is hard for them to stay at the table because [their members] are not unified enough to stay at the table and finish an agreement.\"\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was used in this report.",
    " Title: North Carolina Governor Blames Congress for Lack of Federal Civil Rights Laws, Vows to Continue Bathroom Bill Fight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with TIME, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, under fire for signing a controversial bill that requires transgender residents to use bathrooms corresponding to their sex at birth, has blamed Congress for not updating the nation's civil rights laws. The Republican governor stated that the patchwork of non-discrimination laws at state and local levels is inconsistent, and he believes the Civil Rights Act could resolve contradictions over discrimination in schools, businesses, and government buildings.\n\nMcCrory, who is facing a tough re-election bid this November, also vowed to continue his fight against President Barack Obama's orders that schools allow transgender students to pick their own restrooms or face a cutoff of federal dollars. \"As a country, Congress needs to step up and clarify the Civil Rights Act, which hasn't been updated for decades,\" McCrory said by phone on Wednesday. \"A lot of things have changed since then, including the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage. There's been dramatic change.\"\n\nCongress is currently considering a comprehensive non-discrimination law that would add protections to LGBT Americans. The Equality Act has attracted supporters from both parties, but it's unlikely to make its way to the President's desk before he leaves office early next year. McCrory said he is aware of that legislation but didn't know enough about it to endorse it. However, he said it's time for Congress to do something on the issue of discrimination. \"Congress has been sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. \"Every city and state and town has its own non-discrimination ordinances that are very inconsistent.\"\n\nMcCrory signed legislation that undid one of those local policies. Charlotte, N.C., was among the last major American cities to adopt such a measure\u2014decades after Minneapolis passed the first one in 1975. Some in the GOP are left scratching their heads over why these are controversial. \"Non-discrimination laws belong at the federal level and they have not been updated,\" McCrory said.\n\nLGBT rights advocates have been critical of McCrory and the Republican-led legislature, urging them to scrap the law that, by some estimates, has cost the state's economy $500 million. Corporate America is also lined up against the measure, and have recruited conservative mega-attorney Ted Olsen to write a friends-of-the-court brief on their behalf.\n\nMcCrory said the Left started this fight, and have proven effective opponents. He recently met with the president of the nation's largest LGBT group, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), and called him \"Machiavellian.\" \"Chad [Griffin] was extremely assertive and told me exactly what the campaign was going to entail. He has followed through,\" McCrory said. \"He said he was going to make North Carolina the epicenter of the transgender bathroom rights issue. He was going to bring activists from outside to protest, he was going to bring teams to North Carolina to coordinate protest.\"\n\nGriffin has indeed found some success. \"From across the country, the response has been yes, we're with you,\" Griffin said of the corporate allies. This has left McCrory dangling. \"He's found himself on a very lonely island when it comes to defining a legacy based on bathrooms,\" Griffin said.\n\nEntertainers have announced boycotts until the law is changed, and some Mayors and Governors have banned official travel to North Carolina. McCrory called it hypocrisy, and cited a transgender American Airlines employee, Candis Cox-Daniels, whom he met. McCrory later posited how she would fare in New York state, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo has banned most state employees from going to North Carolina. \"New York does not allow Candis Cox to change her birth certificate. North Carolina does,\" McCrory said. \"Our laws are stronger than New York's laws.\"\n\nThat is little consolation to Cox-Daniels, who is telecommuting to her job at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Her corporate counsel has advised her not to go to her workplace because it falls under the law that would require her to use the men's room. And North Carolina's birth certificate policy is only available to those who can prove they have had reassignment surgery, which can be medically dangerous, costly, and unnecessary.\n\n\"This was not an issue that I had even heard of. We did not seek out this issue,\" McCrory said. \"The HRC, I give them credit. They are more powerful than the NRA.\"\n\nHowever, with Obama's orders, this now should move beyond a question of North Carolina, the Governor said. \"The President has the power to enforce the law, under our Constitution, but he does not have the authority to make or interpret the law,\" he said. \"It's now a national issue that impacts every business in the United States, every university in the United States, every K-12 school in the United States. This goes way beyond North Carolina.\"\n\n\"The Right is often criticized\u2014and rightly so\u2014for wanting to getting involved in the bedrooms,\" he added. \"The Left is wanting to get involved in locker rooms, showers, and bathrooms. It was working pretty well when we were just dealing with it.... I don't think government should tell the private sector what their locker room, shower room, and bathroom policies should be.\"\n\nBut that is, however, what the North Carolina law did for its public buildings. \"There is selective outrage by the corporate media and entertainment elite,\" he said. \"There is a lot of learning and a lot of confusion and complexities that both sides aren't talking about.\"",
    " Title: Religious Communities Adapt to Coronavirus: From Bible Verses to Live Streaming Services\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, religious communities are adapting their practices to maintain a sense of spiritual connection while minimizing the risk of infection. As the virus continues to spread, some Christians are finding solace in Bible verses such as 2 Timothy 1:7, which reads, \"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"\n\nOne example of this adaptation can be seen in Washington D.C., where the lead preacher of Christ Church Georgetown tested positive for coronavirus. In response, officials are urging hundreds of parishioners to self-quarantine. The church had already suspended services and activities as a precaution. The preacher, the Rev. Timothy Cole, remains hospitalized in stable condition in a Washington-area hospital, while his wife and two kids are in self-quarantine.\n\nThe Holy See is also taking preventive measures. In an extraordinary move, Pope Francis delivered mass via video on Monday, intending to show solidarity with those suffering from the virus. The Vatican made a similar move on Sunday to discourage large crowds from gathering in St. Peter's Square.\n\nIn neighboring France, which now has the second most coronavirus cases in Europe, the government has announced a ban on gatherings exceeding 1,000 people. This new precautionary rule could potentially affect Paris Christian Center, which welcomed fifteen new converts at its weekend service. Doroth\u00e9e Rajiah, senior pastor of Paris Christian Center, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News contributing correspondent Chuck Holton, \"Many churches have decided to close their services. If the government asks us to shut down our service, we are ready to stream from our website and from YouTube.\"\n\nIn Greenwood Village, Colorado, parishioners at St. Peter Lutheran Church have replaced traditional handshakes with elbow and fist bumps during the Passing of the Peace. Pastor Dave Risendal explained, \"We're trying to be careful to make sure our communion servers have their hands well clean and that people know how to be careful and thoughtful when they receive the bread and the wine.\"\n\nLast week, the Church of the Nativity\u2014the site where many Christians believe Jesus was born\u2014shut its doors as a precaution. Meanwhile, after temporarily shuttering Islam's holiest site, Saudi Arabia re-opened the Grand Mosque in Mecca for Muslim pilgrims on Saturday.\n\nAs the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, religious communities are demonstrating resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity, finding ways to maintain spiritual connections while prioritizing public health and safety.",
    " Title: Christian Leaders Respond to Supreme Court's Decision on Same-Sex Marriage with Concern, Love, and Warnings of Civil Disobedience\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's historic decision on marriage, Christian leaders are expressing a range of emotions, from love and concern to warnings of potential civil disobedience. The high court has declared that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry anywhere in the United States, overturning the traditional definition of marriage in the remaining 14 states.\n\nFormer governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee tweeted that the ruling is \"an out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny.\" Bob Vander Plaats, a conservative activist in Iowa, told supporters the court \"succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders.\"\n\nThe impact of the gay marriage ruling on religious liberty is a topic of concern for many Christian leaders. Austin Nimocks of the Alliance Defending Freedom shared his perspective in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News. Rev. Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, admonished followers in a tweet, \"The challenge for Christians now is to speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth. Love of neighbor means we cannot lie about marriage.\"\n\nMany Christian leaders believe the ruling will create a restricted role for people of faith in American society. Jim Campbell, Senior Legal Counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, stated, \"The Supreme Court has stripped all Americans of our freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. The freedom to democratically address the most pressing social issues of the day is the heart of liberty.\"\n\nIn the weeks before the ruling came down, the Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance for churches and other faith-based institutions called Protecting Your Ministry. \u2588\u2588\u2588 News interviewed Dr. Russell Moore about the booklet earlier this month.\n\nRev. Samuel Rodriguez believes the decision \"serves as a de facto and legal catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview.\" Many leaders, such as Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have already called for civil disobedience in response to such a ruling. Others individuals and organizations are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond.",
    " Title: \"Brexit Deal: A Closer Look at the Controversial Agreement and Its Implications for the UK\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the terms of the long-awaited Brexit deal, which was agreed upon by the UK and the European Union (EU) negotiators. The deal, spanning over 500 pages, has been met with mixed reactions, with few having read it in its entirety.\n\nThe agreement, according to those who have scrutinized it, confirms earlier leaks, suggesting that post-Brexit, the UK will remain subject to EU rules and regulations, albeit without a say in their creation. This arrangement has been described as a \"common rulebook\" that is, in essence, the EU single-market rulebook.\n\nPrime Minister May argues that this deal fulfills the Brexit that the public voted for two years ago. However, this claim seems at odds with the \"red lines\" May had vowed not to cross last year:\n\n1. Britain will leave the single market and its regulations.\n2. Britain will leave the Customs Union to negotiate free-trade deals with non-EU countries.\n3. Britain will be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\n\nThe deal, however, contradicts these red lines in several ways:\n\n1. Britain will sign on to a \"common rulebook\" that is, in fact, the EU single-market rulebook.\n2. Britain will remain in a customs union with the EU, making it impossible to negotiate free-trade deals with other countries.\n3. Britain will be subject to ECJ jurisdiction on regulation and trade matters, with UK courts taking account of its rulings.\n\nThe deal has sparked intense debate within the UK, with Brexit supporters such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg denouncing it as a betrayal. They argue that if the leader won't change the deal, then they must change the leader. On the other hand, covert Remainers on the Tory side welcome the deal as the best achievable Brexit, even potentially paving the way for a second referendum and Remain itself.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionists, whose support gives the May government its parliamentary majority, have threatened to oppose the deal due to its potential for creating a border within the UK to avoid one between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, which could threaten the Union itself.\n\nPrime Minister May and her loyalist supporters face three interlinked challenges: a possible leadership vote, a possible parliamentary defeat on the EU-UK deal, and a possible election to resolve the Brexit issue. The government is currently in the midst of a political crisis, with several cabinet ministers resigning and at least half the required 48 letters for a vote of confidence having been publicly submitted.\n\nThe future of the UK's relationship with the EU remains uncertain, and the Tories are being urged to choose a new leader who can forge a new policy to achieve a real Brexit. The current deal, many argue, does not meet the expectations of the British public and risks leading the UK into a form of vassalage.",
    " Title: Louisiana's Political Landscape Shifts as John Bel Edwards Wins Governor's Race, Marking a Historic Victory for Democrats in Deep South\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, State Rep. John Bel Edwards emerged victorious in Saturday's election, marking a significant change in the political landscape of the conservative Deep South. Edwards will now be the only Democratic governor in the region, where Republicans have traditionally held sway.\n\nThe election night parties of the two candidates provided a clear indication of the outcome. Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter was based at a hotel near the airport, while John Bel Edwards celebrated at the historic Monteleone Hotel in the French Quarter. A brass band led a second line through the packed ballroom, with revelers waving yellow campaign hankies, signaling Edwards' victory.\n\nThe win is a cause for celebration for Democrats, who have been absent from statewide elected office in Louisiana. Edwards attributes the victory to his supporters who, he says, \"were willing to believe that we could confound the conventional wisdom that this victory just couldn't happen.\"\n\nInitially, Republican Sen. David Vitter was considered the frontrunner. However, by the end of the night, he had conceded defeat and was preparing to leave the U.S. Senate. \"I'm only going to be doing that for one more year, though, this term,\" Vitter said. \"I had decided when I decided to make this race with Wendy that I wanted to pursue new challenges outside the Senate no matter what. I'd reached my personal term limit.\"\n\nVitter's campaign was marred by his ties to a Washington D.C. prostitute in 2007, an incident he publicly confessed to as a \"serious sin.\" Despite this, he won re-election to the Senate in 2010. However, the governor's race proved to be a different challenge. Edwards and his supporters relentlessly attacked Vitter's character, labeling him a liar and a stain on Louisiana.\n\nVitter also faced voter frustration with the current Republican Governor, Bobby Jindal, who is term-limited. Louisiana's other Republican Senator, Bill Cassidy, supported Vitter, but some other GOP officeholders backed Edwards. Cassidy admits that this division within the party hurt Vitter's chances.\n\n\"Clearly Republicans were fractured, and there was a multimillion-dollar superPAC attacking David. For whatever reason, their attacks had a bite,\" he says.\n\nState Rep. Kenny Havard is among those who broke GOP ranks to endorse Edwards. He interprets the election as a message from voters tired of ultra-partisan politics. \"We've got people on the fringe of each party, you know they rule the party. And probably 80 percent of us are stuck in the middle with nowhere to go. So I think the people of Louisiana spoke tonight and spoke with a loud voice,\" Havard said.\n\nEdwards, a veteran and West Point graduate, stakes out some conservative ground, being anti-abortion and pro-gun rights. However, he also plans to expand Medicaid and push for a higher minimum wage, issues popular with Louisiana Democrats.\n\nEdwards promised last night to be a governor for \"all the people.\" With one final punch, he added, \"I will never embarrass you.\"",
    " Title: Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect's Silence and Emerging Evidence: A Look at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, remains largely silent, with his medical condition preventing him from providing law enforcement authorities with substantial information, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, new circumstantial evidence is shedding light on the role of his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who may have radicalized Dzhokhar and played a significant part in the alleged bomb plot. Tamerlan was killed during the brothers' getaway attempt on Friday.\n\nThe elder Tsarnaev brother's radicalization seems to have begun as early as January, when he disrupted a speaker at a Cambridge mosque who compared the prophet Muhammad and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., as reported by The Boston Globe. Tamerlan interrupted the speaker at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque, calling him a nonbeliever, a \"kaffir,\" and accusing him of contaminating people's minds. The congregation did not agree and \"shouted him out of the mosque,\" according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.\n\nDzhokhar's ability to communicate with investigators may be limited even after recovery, as he sustained a wound to the throat area. The nature of the wound is unclear, with authorities unsure whether it was caused by police gunfire or a self-inflicted attempt at suicide. The federal High Value Detainee Interrogation team is reportedly standing by to question Dzhokhar in writing if necessary.\n\nLegal expert Robert Chesney, writing on the \"Lawfare\" blog, notes that law enforcement faces numerous potential charges to use in their indictment of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Charges could be state or federal, and many will likely be ordinary violent-crimes charges rather than terrorism-specific ones.\n\nThe most serious charge Tsarnaev might face is federal: use of a weapon of mass destruction in killing, which can carry the death penalty. However, the \"Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction\" statute has four conditions, one of which must be met for it to apply. The first two conditions may not be applicable, while the third and fourth conditions might fit.\n\nAnother federal terrorism statute that can carry a capital charge and may be applicable is titled \"Acts of Terrorism Transcending National Boundaries.\" If authorities believe some element of the plot began overseas, they could invoke this law, given that Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to Russia for six months in 2011, where he may have met with radical Islamists or received some terrorist training.\n\nOther federal terrorism laws that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev might face charges from include a statute dealing with the bombing of public places and another prohibiting material support for terror acts.\n\nThere is some question as to whether Tsarnaev's trial might be moved outside Massachusetts, on the grounds that any jury pool would be tainted against him. After all, Timothy McVeigh's trial for the Oklahoma City bombing was moved to Colorado for that reason. State authorities are likely to file their own charges against the terror suspect, meaning that at some point he is quite likely to face a Bay State jury.\n\nOn Monday, civil libertarians continued to criticize the Obama administration for its decision to delay reading Tsarnaev his Miranda rights so that it can ask initial questions under a public safety exception to the law. Given the weight of evidence against Tsarnaev, this action is unlikely to have any practical effect on his future trial, note experts. Authorities have so much video, so many tapes, and lots of physical evidence, including explosives, that they would not need to use Tsarnaev's initial statements in any trial, and thus would not need to risk the statements being excluded on legal grounds.",
    " Title: Orlando Mass Killing Fits Grim Pattern of Homegrown Terrorism, Says Peter Bergen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando over the weekend, CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen has highlighted a concerning pattern that has emerged since the 9/11 attacks. According to Bergen, every lethal terrorist attack on U.S. soil in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, with no formal connections or training from recognized terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.\n\nBergen, who is also a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University, has authored the book \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\" He emphasizes that this pattern may not be widely recognized due to the misconception that terrorist attacks in the United States are primarily the work of foreigners.\n\nOmar Mateen, the perpetrator of the Orlando shooting, was an American citizen born in New York to parents who immigrated from Afghanistan. This tragic event marks the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11.\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, the majority of the real terror threat in the United States has come from American citizens or legal permanent residents. This includes the Tsarnaev brothers, who were responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.\n\nIn addition to being an American citizen, Mateen also shares other characteristics with jihadist terrorists in the United States. He was previously on the FBI's radar as a potential militant, much like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau following a tip from the Russian government in 2011 regarding potential militant activity.\n\nThis revelation serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of the terror threat within the United States and the importance of continued vigilance and investigation.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election: A Battle for Home Turf and Statewide Expansion\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Wisconsin residents head to the polls on Tuesday for the highly anticipated recall election of Governor Scott Walker, the focus is on the state's 3 million registered voters and the implications of their decision beyond the borders. This historic vote is more about revisiting the 2010 gubernatorial election than it is about the larger national issues of 2012.\n\nDemocratic challenger Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee since 2004, is aiming to translate his mayoral popularity into a stronger showing than his 2010 performance, particularly in his home county and metro area. In 2010, Barrett won his own city proper in a landslide, but Walker, the then-county executive of Milwaukee County, countered the city vote and kept the countywide margin close.\n\nIn 2006, Democratic Governor Jim Doyle rode a strong Milwaukee County vote to a narrow win for the overall Milwaukee metro area, superseding the usual Republican blowout in the suburban-exurban counties of Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee. In 2010, with turnout down dramatically in the city of Milwaukee, Barrett found that the vote in surrounding counties had grown insurmountable.\n\nFor his part, Walker ran up big margins in the traditional Republican enclaves in the eastern half of the state, from Walworth in the south to Dodge, Fond du Lac, and Winnebago in the east-central part of the state. He had little trouble winning the swing county of Brown, which includes the city of Green Bay.\n\nIn Tuesday's recall, Barrett needs to get much closer to Obama's numbers in the Milwaukee metro, find a way to squeeze even more votes out of Dane, and widen his winning margin in outstate counties such as Eau Claire. It would also help if he could flip counties he lost in 2010, including southeastern Racine and Kenosha near the Illinois state line.\n\nThis tall order explains why even the late polls showing the race getting closer are not shaking the confidence of the governor and his backers. The votes to be counted Tuesday night are likely to follow traditional partisan patterns that have been discernible in the state since the emergence of its modern Democratic Party in the years after World War II.",
    " Title: U.S.-Led Coalition's Progress Against Islamic State Met with Skepticism and Political Tensions at Home\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry expressed optimism about the progress of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS), stating that they are \"winning\" the fight. However, this rosy outlook is met with skepticism from Kurdish leaders and Republican critics who question the U.S.'s leadership and strategy in several global conflicts.\n\nKerry highlighted the coalition's achievements, including the reclamation of significant territories and the elimination of top IS commanders. He emphasized that the evidence of their success is not just in his words, but in the facts of the situation.\n\nHowever, Kurdish leaders involved in the ground combat have expressed concerns about the lack of a clear strategy to eradicate IS. U.S. lawmakers from both parties have also voiced their concern about the need for more support to their allies without deploying American troops directly.\n\nThe disconnect between the administration's portrayal of the situation and the ground realities underscores the challenges faced by the administration as it navigates both real-life battles and political ones at home.\n\nThe rise of jihadist-inspired violence, from Paris to Sydney, and the brutal immolation of a Jordanian pilot by IS, have fueled fears over the tangible and philosophical threats of radical Islam. The Islamic State has also claimed that an American hostage, 26-year-old Kayla Mueller, was killed in a Jordanian airstrike, although officials suspect the group may be lying.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, political tensions are running high in Washington, with members of both parties pointing fingers at each other. The funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to run out on February 27, due to a stalemate over President Obama's executive amnesty for certain illegal immigrants. Members of both parties have warned about the growing threat of homegrown terrorism.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson urged for a fully funded department, stating that a partial shutdown would compromise public safety. While some Republicans worry they're picking the wrong fight, hard-liners argue that DHS can keep the country safe during a shutdown. Others criticize the administration for not setting clear goals.\n\nRepublican senators have also called for the administration to arm the Ukrainian government, which is battling Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country. As attempts at a truce falter, Secretary Kerry has remained tight-lipped about the specific assistance that would be provided to Ukrainian loyalists.\n\nSenators John McCain and Ted Cruz, both Republicans, have signaled that diplomacy may not be enough, with Cruz likening the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy to \"photo op foreign policy.\" Cruz also called for the U.S. to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters, arguing that they are ready-and-willing allies.\n\nSecretary Kerry, however, stated that the administration has already supplied the peshmerga with a significant amount of ammunition, weapons, and other resources. He also emphasized that the battle against IS must ultimately be waged by the Iraqi army, although they are not yet prepared to fight. Kerry reiterated that the coalition believes that everything, including the governing process in Iraq, is moving in the right direction.",
    " Title: The Balance Between Same-sex Marriage and Religious Liberty: A Delicate Tightrope\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over same-sex marriage has a profound religious component, as the interpretation of biblical passages and the role of ancient texts in modern theological understanding are at the heart of the issue. The U.S. Supreme Court, in its upcoming rulings, is not tasked with determining the divine or biblical stance on same-sex marriage, as religious groups hold varying views on the matter.\n\nMarc Stern, senior legal counsel for the American Jewish Committee, emphasizes that the government should not favor one religious view over another regarding gay marriage. In a recent friend-of-the-court brief, the American Jewish Committee stated, \"Religious liberty does not give anyone the right to demand that someone else be deprived of the 'right to live the most intimate portions of their lives according to their own deepest convictions.'\"\n\nThe question of whether recognizing gay marriage infringes upon religious liberty is a key concern. This question extends to various aspects, such as whether religious leaders must provide marriage counseling to same-sex couples, religious colleges must provide housing to same-sex couples, or churches and synagogues must employ spouses in same-sex marriages.\n\nThe resolution of these conflicts will not be straightforward. In some instances, the rights of same-sex couples may unavoidably take precedence, such as in hospital visitation cases. However, there will be cases where religious liberty will trump, and same-sex couples may have to accept that not everyone recognizes their relationships as legitimate.\n\nStern underscores that the government should not dictate religious beliefs or force religious organizations to recognize or facilitate same-sex marriages without compelling reasons. The immediate issue at hand is securing the right to civil marriage for same-sex couples, and they should not be allowed to compel dissenting religious organizations to recognize or facilitate their marriages without just cause.",
    " Title: Texas Gubernatorial Race: Wendy Davis' Ad Sparks Controversy and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Texas gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Wendy Davis' recent ad has stirred controversy and criticism, with many, including MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski, expressing disapproval. The ad, titled \"Justice,\" focuses on Republican challenger Greg Abbott, who has been in a wheelchair since a 1984 accident, and accuses him of not siding with victims during his time in the state Supreme Court or as the Texas attorney general.\n\nBrzezinski, discussing the ad on Monday, said she objects to \"everything from the production of it to the looming voice\" and described it as \"yikes, I cringed watching that.\" She added that Davis is going against her \"brand\" by running such an ad.\n\nDespite the criticism, Davis has defended the ad, stating that Abbott has tried to block cases similar to his own. She told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio over the weekend that Abbott, who was at the receiving end of a tragic accident, had the opportunity to access justice but has since fought to deny access to others who have been wronged.\n\nHowever, the ad seems to be backfiring, according to Republican strategists. Abbott's camp put out a video on Monday, expressing mounting complaints about Davis' ad, labeling her as \"unfit to be governor.\"\n\nAssociate professor at Columbia University, Dorian Warren, told \"The Morning Joe\" show that the ad is \"a huge blunder,\" as Davis, who is losing to Abbott by double digits in state and national polls, is trying to attract voters. Warren stated that negative ads depress voter turnout, and this ad will not motivate Davis' voters to come out.\n\nAbbott himself has expressed his disapproval of the ad, calling it \"offensive\" and \"showing the tenor of the campaign.\" He expects the strategy to backfire, stating, \"If you look at my ads, I focused on what I'm going to be doing as governor, and my opponent spends all her time in ads attacking me.\"\n\nThe controversy has not been limited to Abbott and his campaign. Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn tweeted that Davis took \"the low road,\" while Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted that the ad was \"tasteless.\" Outgoing Gov.

    " Title: U.S. Military Deployment to Southern Border Aims to Assist, Not Hinder, Migrant Caravan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the U.S. Department of Defense has ordered 800 soldiers to the southern border to support Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Health and Human Services, and other authorities as they manage the influx of a migrant caravan originating from Honduras. The caravan, which currently numbers over 10,000 individuals, is making its way towards the United States, with a second caravan forming in its wake.\n\nThe military presence at the border is not intended to stop the caravan, but rather to assist in the processing and care of the newcomers. The soldiers are not authorized to turn back the migrants, as the same rule of law that incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan also makes it difficult to halt their progress.\n\nThe current situation at the border has become a contentious issue, with some Americans expressing concern over the mounting crisis in border states, where thousands of family units and unaccompanied children are being detained while their fates are decided. On the other hand, humanitarian organizations and some political groups support the migrants' right to seek asylum.\n\nThe root of the issue lies in three provisions of U.S. law: a portion of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act that limits the ability of law enforcement to repatriate unaccompanied children from noncontiguous nations; the 1997 Flores settlement that sets a time limit on the detention of these children; and the \"credible fear\" standard by which illegal immigrants may request asylum proceedings. These provisions, along with changing political conditions in Central America, have led to a shift in the demographic makeup of illegal immigration.\n\nIn the past, the majority of individuals apprehended by the Border Patrol were from Mexico. Today, 60% of those apprehended are from Central America. This change in demographics was first evident in the child migration crisis of 2014, and the election of Donald Trump seems to have had only a temporary effect on illegal border crossings.\n\nThe humanitarian instinct is a powerful force in American immigration policy, but it has unintentionally contributed to the current crisis. The desire to help these families, fleeing from failed states and seeking a better future, has been exploited by cynical politicians and non-governmental organizations.\n\nTo address this issue, Congress must take action. Amending the 2008 law to accelerate repatriations, addressing Flores in legislation that permits indefinite detention of family units, and tightening the standards for asylum are necessary steps. Providing more funding for resources such as beds, judges, and bureaucrats to speed up legal proceedings is also crucial.\n\nIn addition, a clear and unequivocal message should be sent that it is the citizens of the United States, acting through their elected representatives, who decide the conditions and criteria under which individuals are allowed to enter this nation.\n\nWhile the military presence at the border is a step towards managing the current crisis, it is ultimately Congress' responsibility to enact the necessary legislation to address the root causes of the issue.",
    " Title: Obama Aims to Shift Focus and Present Vision for Second Term in High-Stakes Speech\n\nIn his acceptance speech tonight, President Barack Obama will seek to transition from a message of hope and change to one of progress and accomplishment. Despite the anticipated release of a jobs report tomorrow indicating continued high unemployment, the President will strive to highlight the achievements of his term while avoiding an overtly triumphant tone.\n\nIn an interview, Martin Medhurst, a professor of political science and rhetoric at Baylor University, explains, \"In an acceptance situation, you want to paint a bright picture of all the wonderful things that have happened over the past four years.\" However, Medhurst acknowledges that the economic climate may make it challenging for Obama to present a particularly optimistic outlook.\n\nThe President's primary objectives, aside from criticizing his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, will be to convince voters that another four years in office will lead to further progress. Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, points to several accomplishments that Obama is likely to emphasize: bailing out the domestic auto industry, expanding health coverage for millions of Americans, reshaping the student loan business, ending the war in Iraq, winding down the war in Afghanistan, and authorizing the mission that led to the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nRybak asserts, \"He's delivered and is going to deliver a lot more than Mitt Romney can ever dream of doing.\"\n\nThroughout the Democratic convention and the campaign as a whole, attacks on Romney's platform will be a recurring theme in Obama's speech. George C. Edwards III, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University, suggests that Obama will frame the election as a choice rather than a referendum on his own record. Edwards explains, \"Obama has to frame the election as a choice, not a referendum [on his own record] \u2014 'I'm better than the other guy.'\"\n\nObama will aim to instill doubts and fears about a potential Romney administration, arguing that it would jeopardize the middle class. He will also draw inspiration from Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 renomination acceptance speech, where Roosevelt argued that the \"economic royalists\" in the Republican Party favored the wealthy, while he was for the common man.\n\nRaising the stakes by depicting a dire picture of a Romney presidency may serve to energize the Democratic base, which has been less enthusiastic about this election compared to Obama's 2008 campaign. David Woodard, a Republican consultant and professor at Clemson University, notes, \"He's been president for four years, and I'm not sure the average person right now could answer the question, 'What does Barack Obama want to do in a second term that would have a better result?'\"\n\nThe theme of the Democratic National Convention has been \"Forward.\" Obama will need to address the question, \"Forward to what?\" Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school, states, \"The challenge for Obama is that he needs to put out, much more than he has, a strong vision for what he wants to do in a second term.\"\n\nWaldman adds, \"Not an imaginary vision of what he would do if Democrats had all the power, but, realistically, what people could expect from him if elected for a second term.\"",
    " Title: Unpopular Candidates: A Look at the 2016 Presidential Race and the Challenges Ahead for Clinton and Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race continues to unfold, a recent headline in the Los Angeles Times encapsulates the current state of the contest: \"A Trump-Clinton general election poses a question: Which one does America hate less?\" The two parties' putative candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are generally disliked by most voters, consistently recording negative favorability ratings this year.\n\nIn a recent poll by YouGov, Donald Trump is viewed unfavorably across various demographic groups, including gender, age, race, and income. Hillary Clinton, while receiving more favorable ratings, is only viewed positively by blacks and Hispanics in these categories.\n\nThe protracted primaries and party infighting have not helped the candidates' images. Typically, candidates become more popular once they secure the nomination, as John Kerry did in 2004, and their image changes from contender to victor. However, this is not always the case. Mitt Romney was viewed unfavorably throughout most of his run in 2012, only receiving a small boost once he won the Republican nomination. In September that year, two months before the election, he still had a negative favorability rating in Gallup polling, making him the only presidential candidate from either party to gain this distinction at that stage of campaigning since at least 1988.\n\nThis year will be different, as the race will feature not one but two unpopular candidates. According to a recent poll, just a third of Americans have a favorable view of Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton does slightly better at 40%, but she may take heart from her husband's campaign. Bill Clinton had a negative favorability rating throughout the spring and early summer of 1992, but it jumped from 41% to 62% when the Democratic National Convention got underway. Hillary Clinton will be looking for a similar boost, provided Bernie Sanders permits, at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.",
    " Title: Multiple Police Officers Shot in Three States in Unrelated Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of seemingly unconnected incidents on Sunday resulted in the shooting of four police officers in three different states, marking a tragic day for law enforcement. The first incident occurred in San Antonio, Texas, where a 20-year veteran, Detective Benjamin Marconi, was shot and killed in an ambush-style attack.\n\nIn San Antonio, the suspect is still at large and is believed to have staked out police headquarters just hours before the shooting. The man briefly gained access to a vestibule of the building before leaving, according to officials. An extensive police dragnet has been unsuccessful in apprehending the suspect.\n\nThe suspect is believed to have been driving a 2009-2012 black Mitsubishi Galant with black rims. San Antonio authorities have released video surveillance footage showing the man outside police headquarters. He is seen speaking to a clerk on an intercom before being let in to a vestibule, but he only stayed a short time before leaving.\n\nDetective Marconi was shot at 11:45 a.m. local time while sitting in his patrol car across from police headquarters, writing a traffic ticket. The suspect, who is believed to have pulled up behind Marconi, shot him twice in the head. The final shot was fired as the assailant reached inside Marconi\u2019s passenger window to shoot the father of two at close range.\n\nIn St. Louis, a sergeant was shot twice in the face at 7:30 p.m. Sunday night and is expected to survive, although he is currently hospitalized in critical condition. The 46-year-old officer, who was not named, is a married father of three and a 20-year veteran of the force.\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, an officer was shot and injured during a similar incident when a person fired at the officer as he sat in his patrol car after finishing a traffic stop. Other officers fired back at the suspect, who was eventually taken into custody.\n\nIn Gladstone, Missouri, an officer sustained non-life-threatening injuries during a struggle with a man in his late teens who had fled from a traffic stop. During the tussle, the man revealed a handgun, shots were fired, and the teen was killed.\n\nThe shootings come less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since September 11, 2001.\n\nTen days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.\n\nIn 2016, 56 state, county, and local officers have been shot while on duty.",
    " Title: Secret Service Struggles with Resource Allocation Amid Expanded Protective Details for Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Secret Service is facing challenges in managing its resources as it expands protective details to include not only the top officials and immediate family of President Donald Trump, but also his adult children's spouses, children, and several top aides, such as Reince Priebus, H. R. McMaster, and Kellyanne Conway. This expansion is expected to ease slightly this summer with the cessation of regular protection for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Obama family.\n\nWith several of these new protectees residing in New York, the Secret Service may consider establishing a fully staffed branch of the presidential protection division in the city, relocating agents from across the country. However, for the time being, the agency is opting to fly agents in from various locations, a less common practice for a routine nonelection detail. This arrangement necessitates the agency's payment for hotel rooms, transportation, and living expenses at Manhattan's high prices.\n\nThe Secret Service has also rented space inside Trump Tower for offices and temporary sleeping quarters, though the specifics of this arrangement remain undisclosed. The New York field office seems to have been significantly impacted, with a third of the agents involved in protection duties on a given day. This has temporarily reduced the office's capacity to handle protective intelligence, financial crime, and cybercrime cases, which are considered crucial for the agency's investigative work, skill development, and protection abilities.\n\nJames F. Tomsheck, a former Secret Service official who left the agency in 2006 after 23 years, expressed concern about the situation, stating, \"Essentially the Secret Service is in a campaign mode all of the time right now. It will greatly degrade the quality of life for most agents in the Secret Service, because of increased travel, protracted periods of time away from family.\"",
    " Title: Analysis: Kamala Harris' Proposed Equal Pay Policy Faces Criticism for Flawed Data and Potential Burdens on Employers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the 2024 presidential election, Democratic California Senator Kamala Harris has proposed a plan titled \"Holding Corporations Accountable for Pay Inequality in America.\" The plan aims to address the issue of pay disparity between men and women, with the goal of achieving \"equal pay for equal work.\" However, a closer look at the data and the potential implications of the policy has sparked criticism.\n\nThe crux of Harris' argument is that women who work full-time are paid, on average, 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. This statistic is the foundation of her report, but it has been called into question due to the methodology used to calculate the pay gap.\n\nHarris' team calculated the pay gap by comparing the median wages of all workers who work 35 hours or more a week for the full year. The problem lies in the fact that these numbers do not compare women with men who perform the same jobs, work the same number of hours, and have the same education.\n\nMoreover, the work of Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, whose research is widely recognized on the left, has shown that when measured properly, the remaining small pay gap is not the result of discrimination. Instead, Goldin's research indicates that women are paid differently due to their demand for \"temporal flexibility,\" which refers to any factor that leads to a desire for more time. This is often referred to as the \"caregiver\" or \"mommy tax.\"\n\nCritics argue that as the workplace evolves, with more telecommuting, increased paternal involvement in child-rearing, and a greater willingness of clients to substitute one worker for another, the pay gap may continue to narrow. In other words, Harris' proposal may be targeting a problem that is not primarily rooted in discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, Harris' proposal to require employers with more than 100 workers to prove that they are not paying women less than men for work of equal value, in exchange for an \"Equal Pay Certification,\" has been met with skepticism. If employers fail to comply, they would have to pay the government \"1% of their profits for every 1% wage gap they allow to persist.\"\n\nCritics argue that this requirement could lead to a bureaucratic nightmare, with businesses having to prove that their employees are paid according to their performance reviews and tasks. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which Harris would task with the certification, would need to add several hundred bureaucrats to its current staff of 2,300 employees to handle the increased workload.\n\nIn conclusion, while the issue of pay inequality is a significant one, Harris' proposed solution has been met with criticism for its flawed data and potential burdens on employers. The policy may require a reevaluation to ensure it addresses the root causes of pay disparity and does not impose unnecessary burdens on businesses.",
    " Title: TIME Magazine Disputes Donald Trump's Claim of Being Offered Person of the Year 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, TIME Magazine refuted President Donald Trump's claim that he was likely to be named the magazine's 2017 Person of the Year. The magazine stated that Trump's assertion was \"incorrect,\" and that it does not comment on its choice until the official announcement on December 6.\n\nTrump had earlier tweeted that TIME Magazine had contacted him about being named Person of the Year, but he declined the offer due to editorial obligations. He claimed that the magazine had proposed an interview and a photo shoot, which he found unacceptable.\n\n\"The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year,\" the magazine tweeted Friday night. \"TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.\"\n\nAlan Murray, the chief content officer of Time Inc., also dismissed Trump's claims, tweeting, \"Amazing. Not a speck of truth here.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump was named TIME's Person of the Year. However, he had taken exception to the award, particularly the cover image, which read \"President of the Divided States of America.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's claims, TIME Magazine has opened an unofficial public poll for the 2017 Person of the Year. As of this post, Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is in the lead with 21% of the vote. Trump is tied for third place at 5% with the hashtag \"#MeToo\" and \"The Dreamers,\" a term referring to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US.\n\nThe poll is open for voting, and readers can cast their votes for their preferred candidate. The results of the unofficial poll may not reflect the final decision, as the official choice is made by TIME's editors and is not influenced by public opinion.",
    " Title: Bolton's Memoir Reveals Trump's Approval of China's Uighur Muslim Concentration Camps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bombshell revelation, former National Security Advisor John Bolton's upcoming memoir, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" claims that President Donald Trump expressed approval of China's concentration camps for Uighur Muslims during a private meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAccording to Bolton's book, parts of which were published in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, the meeting took place during the 2019 G20 meeting in Japan, with only the leaders and their interpreters present. Xi reportedly explained to Trump why he was building concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the interpreter recounted that Trump responded by saying Xi should continue with the construction, which Trump believed was the right thing to do.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has been criticized for constructing large concentration camps in Xinjiang, where millions of ethnic minority Uighur Muslims are believed to be detained under the guise of a counterterrorism campaign. Inside these camps, approximately 2 million to 3 million Uighur Muslims are under surveillance and subject to mandatory \"reeducation\" training. One survivor reported beatings, medical experiments, and forced watching of gang rapes.\n\nThe camps have been criticized by the White House, and lawmakers from both parties have condemned the practice. Trump, however, initially showed reluctance to take action against China for its treatment of the Uighur Muslims but later signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act on Wednesday. The bipartisan bill calls for sanctions against officials involved with the camps.\n\nChina has continued to deny the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims and claims that the allegations \"blatantly smear China's counterterrorism and deradicalization measures and seriously interfere in China's internal affairs.\"\n\nBolton's book has caused a stir in Washington and the political sphere. The former national security adviser accuses the House of Representatives of \"impeachment malpractice\" in his memoir and claims that Trump engaged in far more objectionable conduct than what he was impeached for.\n\nIn the book, Bolton describes how Trump \"pleaded\" with Xi for China to purchase US agricultural products to help him win reelection in 2020. The former national security adviser also alleges that Trump's actions related to his China policy \"formed a pattern of fundamentally unacceptable behavior that eroded the very legitimacy of the presidency.\"\n\nThe Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act is a significant step towards addressing the human rights abuses in Xinjiang, but the situation remains a contentious issue between the US and China.",
    " Title: Trump's National Security Strategy: Economic Prosperity at the Forefront of U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, President Trump unveiled a new national security strategy on Monday that places U.S. economic issues at the center of U.S. foreign policy. The strategy, which is the first comprehensive update since 2015, is built on four pillars: protecting the American people, promoting economic prosperity, preserving peace through a strong military, and advancing American interests abroad.\n\nIn a speech outlining the new strategy, Trump emphasized the need for the U.S. to compete in the global arena. \"We are declaring that America is in the game, and America is going to win,\" he said. The strategy aims to balance political and economic competition with countries like Russia and China, while also enlisting their help in addressing security challenges such as North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nTrump's foreign policy vision, delivered in a speech to 600 people including uniformed service members and other national security officials, was a mix of a first-year report card and a forward-looking security vision. The president boasted low unemployment numbers and a soaring stock market, while taking aim at his predecessors on trade, borders, and immigration.\n\nThe strategy places more emphasis on the business climate than on climate change, a key focus of Obama's last national security strategy document. The strategy also counters an \"anti-growth energy agenda\" that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests.\n\nThe strategy places an emphasis on cyber-security, although it reduces the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to just a couple of lines in the written report. Trump omitted even this vague reference from his speech, saying only that the U.S. must \"address new forms of conflict such as economic and political aggression.\"\n\nThe strategy describes Russia and China as \"revisionist powers\" intent on changing the global status quo by illegitimately seizing territory. China's unique economic and military clout makes it what the report calls a \"strategic competitor.\" However, the strategy does not rule out cooperation with these countries when their interests align.\n\nThe strategy also expands the concept of national security to include fair trade, tax reform, and deregulation. The strategy promotes the idea of a \"national security innovation base,\" a term coined by Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro to describe the technology and other intellectual property that gives the U.S. a strategic and economic advantage in the world.",
    " Title: The Power of Personal Encounters: Breaking Down Barriers and Promoting Empathy in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a society where prejudice and discrimination are prevalent, it is often assumed that people are less bigoted in theory than in practice. However, a study conducted by sociologist Richard LaPiere in 1934 challenges this assumption, revealing that people are more hostile to others in the abstract than when they meet them in person.\n\nLaPiere's experiment involved traveling across the United States with a Chinese couple, observing the service they received at 251 hotels and restaurants. To his surprise, the couple was denied service only once. Yet, the most striking finding was not the low incidence of discrimination they encountered, but the responses received after the experiment.\n\nAfter sending questionnaires to all 251 establishments, asking whether they would serve \"members of the Chinese race,\" only one establishment said they would; 92% said they would not; the rest were uncertain.\n\nThis experiment illustrates a phenomenon known as \"othering,\" where individuals are stereotyped, marginalized, or excluded based on their membership in a certain group or category. However, it also demonstrates that people are more likely to express prejudice in theory than in practice, as they are more open to interaction and acceptance when they encounter others in person.\n\nThis finding can be applied to various social issues, such as the endorsement of gay rights that often occurs when people realize they have gay relatives and colleagues. To make compassion and empathy less rare and random in America today, it is essential to embrace opportunities for personal encounters and to challenge ourselves to engage with those who may be different from us.\n\nIndividuals can start by inviting the \"other\" onto their stage, whether that be a literal stage or a metaphorical one in our daily lives. They can follow the example of activists like Tommy Gunn and Hawk Newsome, who go where they are not typically welcome and share their perspectives.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to reject the homogeneity and anonymity of social networks and to celebrate leaders who go where they are not ordinarily welcomed. Supporting institutions dedicated to a respectful competition of ideas and patronizing news outlets that combat anonymous hatred can also contribute to a more empathetic and compassionate society.\n\nWhile this may seem like a daunting task, the recent rally in Washington, where people from diverse backgrounds came together to promote understanding and empathy, offers a glimmer of hope. By embracing opportunities for personal encounters and promoting empathy, it is possible to create a more compassionate and inclusive America.",
    " Title: Parents Urged to Assess School Safety Plans Following Georgia Elementary School Shooting Incident\n\nAn elementary school in Decatur, Georgia, was the site of a recent shooting incident, where a gunman armed with an assault rifle was apprehended before causing any injuries or fatalities. While the outcome of this incident was fortunate, it has prompted a call for parents to be proactive in assessing their children's school safety plans.\n\nJohn Matthews, a concerned parent, emphasizes the importance of asking school administrators critical questions to ensure the safety of their children. One of the primary questions parents should ask is whether the school has a customized crisis response plan tailored to its unique characteristics, demographics, and personnel.\n\nMatthews also stresses the importance of regular safety drills, such as lockdowns, shelter-in-place, and evacuations, to prepare students and staff for emergencies. He suggests that schools should practice such drills at least once per semester, with teachers and school staff also drilling during in-service training days.\n\nParents should also be informed about their role during a school crisis, including whom to contact, where to go, and what to do upon arrival. It is crucial to be aware of the school and district's policies for nontraditional releases, such as evacuations, and to be prepared to show proper identification.\n\nAnother essential question to ask is whether both staff and students have received training on what to do during an active shooter incident. Parents should inquire about the training provided and the materials made available for discussions with their children and additional practice if necessary.\n\nLastly, parents should ask if the school has partnered with its local law enforcement agency to practice emergency response procedures. Cooperation between schools and law enforcement agencies is crucial for real-time practice scenarios and a comprehensive school safety plan.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is impossible to predict when a disaster may occur, parents can take proactive steps to ensure their children's schools have implemented the necessary measures to respond effectively and safely in the event of an emergency, such as a shooting.",
    " Title: Gallup Study Reveals Millennials Prioritize Job Fulfillment Over Traditional Job Factors\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study by polling firm Gallup suggests that the job-hopping tendencies and lower engagement levels among millennials in the workforce may be a result of their emphasis on finding meaningful work rather than high-paying jobs. The study, which tracked four generations, found that 55 percent of millennials report being \"checked out\" and lacking passion for their work, with only 29 percent reporting active engagement.\n\nThe study, which analyzed over 1.5 million employees, attributes the job-hopping among millennials to their search for fulfilling work. This search for meaning at work comes at a cost, with the Gallup analysis estimating that it costs the U.S. economy about $30.5 billion annually.\n\nWhen looking for a new job, millennials prioritize opportunities to learn and grow, quality of management, interest in the type of work, and opportunities for advancement above income. Eighty-seven percent of millennials said personal development is an important characteristic in a job, and fewer millennials than other generations said they would pursue a different line of work for a raise.\n\nThe study also found that millennials have a higher turnover rate, with 21 percent changing jobs last year, and 60 percent saying they are currently open to a change in employment. This is more than 15 points higher than non-millennials.\n\nThe study also found that millennials thrive on constant communication and interaction. About 44 percent who said they meet with their manager on a regular basis reported being engaged in their work, compared to a 20 percent engagement rate for those who said they do not meet regularly with their manager.\n\nThe increased emphasis on jobs with meaning and the potential for personal development comes as the younger generation eschews conventional societal institutions, such as family and the church. The study found that just 27 percent of millennials are married, compared to 36 percent of Gen Xers, 48 percent of baby boomers, and 65 percent of traditionalists who were married at that stage in their lives. Additionally, the survey notes that just 55 percent of millennials report having interest in religion, compared to 65 percent of Gen Xers, 70 percent of baby boomers, and 75 percent of traditionalists.\n\nGreg Jao, vice president of campus engagement for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, suggests that the capricious employment habits of young people entering the workforce can be interpreted as a winding search for meaning and the desire for bosses who double as life coaches. He believes that millennials are looking for people who help provide meaning and coherence to what they are experiencing.\n\n\"I don't think, as a generation, they're apathetic or disengaged; I think they're looking for people who help provide meaning and coherence to what they're experiencing,\" Mr. Jao said. \"And I think if millennials find a job where the goal is just to make a profit for your corporation or have a good paycheck, that's not satisfying to them.\"\n\nMr. Jao also pointed to the ascendance of activism on college campuses, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, as a similar attempt by young people to belong to groups that transmit a sense of purpose greater than oneself.",
    " Title: Key Players in Government Shutdown Remain Divided as Shutdown Ends, Immigration Remains Unresolved\n\nArticle:\n\nThree days after a heated debate over federal spending and immigration policy led to a government shutdown, key battles between Democrats and Republicans remained unresolved on Tuesday. The compromise, which ended the shutdown and returned hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work after they were furloughed on Monday, comes at a time of profound political polarization in Washington, where trust across the aisle is in short supply.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump signed a short-term spending measure after Senate Democrats agreed on legislation to fund the government for three weeks, in exchange for a commitment to vote on ensuring protection for Dreamers, young undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as children. The compromise, which ended the shutdown, was met with criticism from liberal groups and progressive lawmakers who were furious after a majority of Senate Democrats voted to end the shutdown, trusting that the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would indeed allow a vote on immigration next month.\n\nMcConnell on Tuesday reiterated that it was his \"intention\" to allow debate on immigration legislation that would protect Dreamers. The offer, he said, was conditional on the government remaining open, a tactical move to ward off another shutdown in three weeks.\n\n\"Because common sense and bipartisanship won out yesterday, we have a fresh start today,\" McConnell said in a floor speech on Tuesday. \"I challenge everyone to make the most of it. The American people are watching.\"\n\nAsked what he would say to Dreamers who were fearful the majority leader won't keep his promise, McConnell told reporters: \"I intend to keep my word.\"\n\nEven if the Senate does act, however, there is no guarantee the House Republican leadership will follow. But the deal was enough to win support from 33 Senate Democrats, who joined 48 Republicans to reopen the government on Monday night. Sixteen progressive Democrats voted against the measure, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, who said it would be \"foolhardy\" to trust McConnell.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the president tweeted: \"Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] by February 8, but everyone will be trying.... with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security.\"\n\n\"The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!\"\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, parried criticism on Tuesday, insisting that the Democratic leadership was \"pleased\" by the outcome of what was an audacious gambit to force Republicans' hand on immigration. He told reporters that Democrats were \"a lot better off today when it comes to the cause of Dreamers than we were four or five days ago.\"\n\n\"Leader McConnell made a promise not just to Democrats but to Republicans as well. We expect him to keep his word to the body,\" Schumer said, adding later that the motto was \"trust but verify.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are no closer to resolving the issues that triggered the shutdown. They have no consensus on a budget and have yet to settle on an immigration compromise that could pass both chambers and win support from a White House in which immigration hardliners have the president's ear.\n\nTrump praised one of those hardliners, his chief of staff, on Tuesday, tweeting: \"Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!\"\n\nThe path to a bipartisan immigration solution that satisfies Democrats' desire for Dreamer protections, Republicans' requirement for increased border security, and Trump's demand for a wall seemed as distant as ever on Tuesday. An inchoate effort to restart negotiations was underway in the Senate without clear direction or leadership. Several senators on Tuesday said the current state of negotiations was unmoored from an earlier bipartisan effort that paired increased border security and tighter controls on immigration with a Dream Act, legislation that would offer a conditional path to citizenship for certain undocumented people.\n\n\"There is not even an agreement on a starting point,\" said Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, who has been at the center of negotiations over Dreamers. \"But I will tell you, there is only one bipartisan bill that has been brought before the Senate. That should be the starting point.\"\n\nBut Trump rejected the plan drafted by the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Durbin. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, on Tuesday called the plan \"unacceptable\" and said the legislation should be \"declared dead on arrival\" because it failed to meet the administration's demands on border security.\n\nFlake said negotiators had abandoned that legislation as talks resumed to find a compromise solution on immigration. \"This is a new effort entirely,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Schumer has rescinded his offer to allow funding for the construction on a border wall, which he had extended to Trump in a last-ditch effort to stave off a shutdown. Since the White House rejected that offer, Schumer said he had taken the wall offer \"off the table.\"\n\nLeft uncertain is the status of the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants, after Trump rescinded DACA in September and gave Congress a six-month grace period to resolve the issue legislatively. The path to a bipartisan immigration solution that satisfies Democrats' desire for Dreamer protections, Republicans' requirement for increased border security, and Trump's demand for a wall seemed as distant as ever on Tuesday.",
    " Title: California Schools Brace for Potential Coronavirus Outbreak, Review Emergency Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nEducation officials in California are reviewing and updating emergency plans in response to the potential spread of the new coronavirus within the state. Federal officials have urged schools to start considering contingency plans for a local outbreak, as the virus has been detected in countries outside of China and is expected to eventually reach the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Solano County resident tested positive for the virus, marking the first case in the country from an unknown source. In response, the Fairfield-Suisin Unified School District, located in Solano County, has increased disinfection efforts, recommending daily cleaning of commonly shared surfaces to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nDr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stated that schools may need to consider closing, holding classes in smaller groups, or providing remote education via the internet as the virus spreads. \"I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe,\" she said. \"But these are things that people need to start thinking about now.\"\n\nIn the event of school closures, parents are encouraged to plan for childcare and consider the potential disruption to their daily lives. Many children in China are currently attending school remotely, but schools in the Bay Area and across the country may not have the necessary resources for online learning due to a lack of computer or internet access for many students.\n\nSchool districts are required to have emergency plans for earthquakes, fires, active shooters, and other critical events, and in recent years, pandemic flu plans have been added to address communicable diseases like the coronavirus. Tulare County, for example, has a plan that includes guidance to close a school if more than 30% of students are ill.\n\nState and county officials are providing guidance to California school districts on how to handle a potential outbreak. San Francisco schools spokeswoman Laura Dudnick stated, \"Although there are still zero confirmed cases in San Francisco residents, the global picture is changing rapidly, and we are working with the city to ensure we are prepared in the event that our schools are impacted.\"\n\nThe California Department of Education is monitoring the situation and working closely with agency partners to determine the best steps to prepare for the coronavirus. Any decisions to close schools would be made by individual county health agencies and school districts. In Contra Costa County, officials are in constant communication with county health officials and are preparing a plan to respond if any of their schools are at risk of becoming impacted.",
    " Title: Historic Gender Voting Gap Predicted in 2016 Election, Largest in Over 60 Years\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming 2016 election could witness a significant shift in voting patterns, with the potential for the largest gender voting gap in over 60 years. According to recent polls, the gender gap could reach a staggering 25 points, with women favoring Hillary Clinton by 13 points and men supporting Donald Trump by 12 points.\n\nWhile it may seem logical that this kind of gap is occurring in the first election in which a woman is a major-party presidential candidate, it's not necessarily due to women flocking to Clinton. Instead, research suggests that party identification plays a more significant role in voting decisions. In fact, Clinton may not win women by as large a margin as her husband did in 1996.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the gender gap is not so much Clinton pulling women into her camp as Trump pushing them out of his. Trump's overt sexism and comments about assaulting women have repulsed even some reliably conservative voters, such as white evangelical women. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign has adopted an overtly masculine tone, which may help explain his appeal to men.\n\nNeither gender is a monolithic voting bloc, with various fissures crossing either group. For instance, single women vote more Democratic than married women, and white-collar white men are less Republican than blue-collar white men. However, 2016 could be unusual among white women, as they swung Democratic only once in recent election history, in 1996. This year, polls suggest white women could swing Democratic for the first time in 20 years, though they are currently leaning slightly Republican.\n\nWhile whites make up nearly three-quarters of the electorate, their choices will help drive the broader gender gap. However, it appears that the white gender gap may not be as historic as the one seen nationwide, across all races. The 2016 election could mark a significant shift in voting patterns, with the potential for a record-breaking gender gap in the presidential race.",
    " Title: South Korean President Moon Jae-in Suggests President Trump for Nobel Peace Prize Following Historic Summit with North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in facilitating talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and potentially ending the decades-long war between North and South Korea.\n\nMoon's comments came after a congratulatory message from Lee Hee-ho, the widow of late South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who suggested Moon himself should win the prize for his work with North Korea. In response, Moon reportedly stated that Trump should be the one to receive the prize, saying, \"President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. What we need is only peace.\"\n\nThe comments were made just days after Moon and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un met for a summit at the Peace House in Panmunjom. Trump also continued to play an active role on Monday, floating the possibility of holding his expected summit with Kim at the same location.\n\nDuring the summit, the Korean leaders announced their commitment to achieving a \"nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\" and expressed hope to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War by the end of the year. However, it is not yet clear whether this will come to fruition.\n\nThe leaders also agreed to suspend all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment along the heavily-armed border, as well as to stop flying propaganda leaflets across the border. Kim also promised Moon that he \"won't interrupt\" his \"early morning sleep anymore,\" referring to missile tests.\n\nDuring the summit, the Korean leaders also agreed to jointly push for talks with the United States and potentially China to officially end the war. They also agreed to stop all hostile acts over \"land, sea, and air\" that cause military clashes and tensions.\n\nThe date for Trump's expected summit with Kim has not yet been scheduled. Last week, Trump criticized media reports that he was making concessions to secure the meeting with the North Korean dictator as inaccurate. Newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea earlier this month to lay the foundation for the meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nTrump has imposed what his administration describes as \"the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country\" on North Korea, crippling the DPRK's economy. Under the sanctions, the Treasury Department aimed to cut off sources of revenue and fuel used to boost the country's nuclear program and military.\n\nU.S. officials have stated that the sanctions were also aimed at hindering the regime's ability to transport coal and fuel in international waters, in an effort to further isolate the rogue regime and advance the U.S. pressure campaign.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Request Explanation on Potential Conflicts of Interest Involving Whitaker and Benczkowski at the Justice Department\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - A group of Senate Democrats, led by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), has sent a letter to the Justice Department, expressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest involving Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski.\n\nThe letter, which also includes signatories Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), focuses on more than $1.2 million in compensation Whitaker received as executive director of an organization that has sued Democratic lawmakers in the past, and Benczkowski's history working on behalf of a Russian bank.\n\nThe senators argue that these ties create ethical concerns, particularly in relation to the ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. They claim that previous Department of Justice responses to information requests on these officials have been heavily redacted, with some requests being renewed due to the DOJ's failure to respond or provide incomplete responses to prior Congressional requests.\n\n\"To maintain the public's trust in an impartial DOJ, we urge you to provide prompt, complete, and public responses to the issues we raise,\" the senators wrote.\n\nWhitaker took over the top job at the Justice Department after President Donald Trump pushed out Attorney General Jeff Sessions in early November. Trump had been critical of Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation. Whitaker has not recused himself from the investigation, though he promised House Democrats that he would not tamper with its integrity.\n\nAs a private lawyer, Benczkowski represented Alfa Bank, whose owners have been identified by the Treasury Department as oligarchs with close ties to the Russian government, according to the letter. Senate Democrats criticized Benczkowski's nomination and his confirmation in July, though he said at the time he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the bank.",
    " Title: St. Louis Police Officer's Association Calls for NFL Discipline Over Rams Players' \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" Gesture\n\nArticle:\n\nThe St. Louis Police Officer's Association has requested the National Football League (NFL) to take disciplinary action against St. Louis Rams players who participated in \"hands up, don't shoot\" displays during Sunday's game. The association finds the gestures tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory, citing their connection to the controversial Ferguson case.\n\nIn a statement, the association stated that five Rams players, including Jared Cook, Kenny Britt, Stedman Bailey, Chris Givens, and Tavon Austin from the team's receiving corps, as well as rookie running back Tre Mason, made the gesture during pregame introductions and after scoring a touchdown, respectively.\n\nThe Rams secured a decisive victory over the Oakland Raiders 52-0 at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis on Sunday. The team has denied any prior knowledge of the on-field demonstrations.\n\nLast week, a grand jury declined to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for the killing of Michael Brown, a teenager involved in a convenience-store robbery prior to his death. The decision sparked riots, looting, and violence in Ferguson, Missouri. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force over the weekend.\n\nJeff Roorda, a spokesperson for the St. Louis Police Officer's Association, expressed concern about the timing and location of the demonstrations. \"Our officers have been working 12-hour shifts for over a week,\" Roorda said. \"They had days off including Thanksgiving cancelled so that they could defend this community from those on the streets that perpetuate this myth that Michael Brown was executed by a brother police officer. And then, as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer. That is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance.\"",
    " Title: \"Border Residents Question Effectiveness of Proposed Wall Between U.S. and Mexico\"\n\nArticle:\n\nBROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2014 As the U.S. presidential election approaches, the prospect of a Donald Trump victory has raised concerns among residents in this southernmost U.S. city about the potential impact on their efforts to build trade ties with Mexico.\n\nBonnie Elbert, a conservative resident whose family has tended citrus farms in the area since the 1920s, expressed skepticism about Trump's proposal to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, citing the ineffectiveness of the existing 18-foot-tall iron fence that cuts through her property.\n\n\"The one we have doesn't really work,\" Elbert said, driving through Loop Farms, more than 700 acres of orange and grapefruit orchards. \"What makes them think a new one will?\"\n\nTrump's proposal to build a 40-foot-high wall across the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it has sparked a Twitter clash between the Republican candidate and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The current fence, erected in 2009 and stretching from Brownsville to the California coast, has been largely ineffective in stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs, according to residents, community leaders, and border patrol officials.\n\nBrownsville Mayor Tony Martinez called the idea of a newer, bigger wall a waste of money and futile in preventing illegal crossings. \"It's gibberish,\" Martinez said. \"It doesn't prevent people from coming in or drugs from coming in. It's not a deterrent and it's not effective.\"\n\nBorder Patrol agent Chris Cabrera, who is based in McAllen and is the vice president of the local chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents' union, noted that the current fence has been bypassed by smugglers using ladders. He added that the Border Patrol union has endorsed Trump because of his focus on border security and immigration reform, but the concept of building a bigger wall without other measures, such as increased manpower and technology, is ill-informed.\n\nThe security fence project also ran into a litany of private property lawsuits and environmental opposition that ran up costs and led to delays, according to Denise Gilman, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas-Austin School of Law. Most of the land along the Texas border is privately owned, making it much harder for the federal government to acquire and build on. A new wall will face similar challenges.\n\nThe current wall snakes through the Rio Grande Valley, at times cutting right through residents' lawns and through old town Brownsville, where some of the city's most historic buildings sit. Mark Clark, who bought his two-story brick building a decade ago, lamented the view of the rust-colored fence from his second-story balcony. The fence has broken up the continuity and goodwill between Brownsville and Matamoros, its sister city across the river in Mexico, and created an eyesore that rankles most locals. Across the river, Mexicans call it \"El Berlin,\" alluding to the 27-mile concrete wall that once divided East and West Berlin during the Cold War.\n\n\"It's just embarrassing,\" Clark said. \"This has been a psychological disaster and a colossal waste of money. When's it going to end?\"",
    " Title: The Enduring Hostility Towards Hillary Clinton: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nA cloud of mistrust has long hung over Hillary Clinton's political career, but the origins of this antipathy run deeper than the current election cycle. There exists a significant group of individuals who may not personally know Clinton, yet harbor intense dislike for her. Whether they are part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" as Clinton described in 1998 or simply a large, conservative-leaning demographic, their existence and influence is undeniable.\n\nBeyond the more outlandish conspiracy theories (such as claims that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian, a member of the Illuminati, or an agent of the devil), an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has shaped public perception of Clinton. Her unfavorability rating may not match that of Donald Trump, but in this election year marked by name-calling, she has faced invective from both the left and the right. Polls have consistently shown that the public views her as untrustworthy, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the \"Crooked Hillary\" epithet.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton's links to Wall Street, her missing emails, and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate have fueled personal attacks. However, the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.\n\nCraig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, noted that when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington D.C. as First Lady, she came with a reputation already established as a \"militant feminist, difficult to deal with.\" Shirley pointed out that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, due to her keeping her maiden name. \"Here she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale, down to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with her,\" Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time.\n\nBy the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clinton's presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be \u2013 a potential liability to her husband's political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly. And, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative.\n\nFirst, there was her much-maligned \"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette\" comment in response to a reporter's assertion that she and her husband had \"some sort of understanding and arrangement\" about his infidelity. Then, her out-of-context \"I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies\" comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.\n\nAnd then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she'd invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she \u2013 contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president's staff \u2013 was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.\n\nThe key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out. The Starr investigation, which eventually resulted in Bill Clinton's impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton's administration, argued that people's dislike of Hillary Clinton is not her own fault. \"This business of people 'not liking' her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,\" she said. \"She is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,\" she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers, Kamarck noted that Clinton \"reminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn't like.\"\n\n\"I think there's some misogyny in that,\" said Kamarck, noting that it's exceedingly common for men who don't hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards. \"We will overcome this, but right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, they're strong, they're wise,\" she added. \"Old women, we're not so sure.\"",
    " Title: Grand Jury Convened in Russia Probe Signals Expansion of Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election has taken a significant turn, with the convening of a grand jury in Washington, D.C. This development indicates that the probe, initially focused on potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, is now expanding to potentially charge individuals with criminal offenses.\n\nThe grand jury's role is to subpoena documents, ensure witnesses testify under oath, and formally charge someone with a crime if deemed necessary. The move to involve a grand jury suggests that Mueller has found substantial grounds for further investigation.\n\nAccording to CNN, the special counsel has been particularly interested in the financial ties between Trump associates and Russia. This aligns with the hiring of 16 lawyers by Mueller's team, who have expertise in areas such as cybercrime, white-collar crime, and financial crime.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the Wall Street Journal, \"This is yet a further sign that there is a long-term, large-scale series of prosecutions being contemplated and being pursued by the special counsel.\" He added, \"This suggests that the investigation is bigger and wider than Flynn, perhaps substantially so.\"\n\nThe growing inquiry poses a challenge for President Trump, as it becomes increasingly difficult for him to dismiss Mueller without a compelling reason. If Trump were to attempt to remove Mueller now, it could be perceived as a reaction to the intensifying investigation, with no evidence of Mueller's incompetence in his role.\n\nRepublicans have cautioned Trump against dismissing Mueller, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) telling NBC News, \"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency, unless Mueller did something wrong.\"\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how President Trump will respond to the expanding probe into his finances, associates, and family.",
    " Title: Economic Uncertainty Looms as President Obama Faces Job Growth Challenges Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 presidential election approaches, President Barack Obama is grappling with an underperforming economy, particularly in terms of job creation. Four months before Election Day, the economy is not meeting job-growth forecasts, a trend that has created a political stalemate.\n\nThe Labor Department's monthly job reports have become a source of political spin, with Republicans using disappointing numbers to criticize Obama's economic policies, while White House officials and Democrats emphasize the net job creation, albeit not enough to significantly reduce the jobless rate.\n\nThe latest jobs report, released on Friday, showed more than 80,000 jobs created in June, a figure that President Obama described as a \"step in the right direction.\" Republican nominee Mitt Romney, meanwhile, called the June numbers a \"kick in the gut.\"\n\nThe jobs reports, however, do not provide a clear picture of the economy's health. Economists suggest that the economy is not in recession, but it is not creating jobs at a pace that would significantly lower the unemployment rate, which has been above 8 percent for 41 consecutive months.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute, wrote that the U.S. economy has a deficit of 10 million jobs. She stated, \"We are not in \u2014 nor are we slipping into \u2014 another recession, but neither are we getting the kind of job growth that will bring down the unemployment rate.\"\n\nHistorically, high unemployment rates have been associated with incumbents losing their re-election bids. Since 1960, there have been four presidential elections featuring incumbents with unemployment rates above 7 percent, and only one, Ronald Reagan in 1984, managed to secure a second term.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider other factors that may have played significant roles in past elections. For instance, President Gerald Ford was hurt by his pardon of Richard Nixon, while President Jimmy Carter was damaged by a primary challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy. In 1992, H. Ross Perot's third-party bid pulled votes away from President George H.W. Bush, allowing Bill Clinton to win with just 43 percent of the popular vote.\n\nDespite the challenging economic conditions, the lackluster growth and job creation are significant factors propelling Romney's candidacy. Romney has made the economy's underwhelming performance, which he blames on Obama, the cornerstone of his argument for a change in the White House.\n\nRomney's strategy does not seem to be shifting anytime soon, as the slowdown of economies in Europe and China suggests the situation may worsen before improving. While Obama cannot control the global economy's impact on the U.S., he can direct voters' attention to his achievements on the jobs front, as he has done during his recent Ohio bus tour.\n\nIn Ohio, a critical battleground state with many companies that supply the auto industry, Obama has emphasized his actions to save the U.S. auto companies and reminded audiences of Romney's opposition to such moves. Obama has also demonstrated a resilience and political acumen that has often left his opponents questioning his political prowess.\n\nWhether Obama can defy political gravity and secure a second term remains to be seen. However, history has shown that betting against Obama is no sure thing.",
    " Title: Obamacare's Third Open Enrollment Faces Challenges as Premiums Rise and Choices Narrow\n\nArticle:\n\nThe third year of Obamacare's open enrollment began on Sunday, with a revamped website and new features, but the reality of the president's signature healthcare law has worsened for many. As people log on to the government exchanges, they will encounter rising costs, cancellations, and diminishing choices.\n\nPremiums are increasing significantly in many states, with Alaska seeing a nearly 40% increase in premiums next year, and Minnesota residents facing a 14-49% increase. Out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-pays, are also on the rise.\n\nPresident Obama's mantra of \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" has been replaced with \"If you have an Obamacare plan, you better shop around.\" The administration's advice for people seeking to avoid brutal rate increases is to switch insurance plans annually.\n\nSome people, however, will find that their old plan is no longer available, including over half a million people insured by the health co-ops that have shut down in 11 states and those whose insurer has decided to stop offering Obamacare coverage. In Wyoming, for example, the company WINHealth is dropping out of the exchange entirely.\n\nIn some states, plans are changing significantly, even if the company remains. A patient may find that her longtime doctor is no longer part of her plan's network, or that her nearest hospital is no longer included by her insurance. These changes can result in very different coverage compared to what was previously available.\n\nThe number of options on the exchanges is also shrinking. In 14 of Nevada's 16 counties, people will have only one or two companies to choose from. In Wyoming, with the failure of WINHealth, residents will have only one option.\n\nInsurance through Obamacare is increasingly becoming a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, with more and more Americans choosing the latter. The only people consistently signing up are those who receive subsidies from Washington. According to the IRS, 90% of people who received government insurance subsidies last year got the wrong amount.\n\nTo avoid an all-out panic over low enrollment, the administration has lowered the bar for success to around 10 million people enrolled for 2016, half of the 21 million people the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says should be covered next year. It's also essentially flat compared to the 9.9 million who were enrolled in June.\n\nSenator John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and a physician, warns that Obamacare's collapse may be imminent as costs continue to rise, cancellations mount, and the exchanges offer fewer choices. The only people who are consistently signing up are those who get subsidies from Washington. For so many people, Obamacare doesn't have much to offer.",
    " Title: Far-Left Groups at the Forefront of Political Violence in America: An Examination of their Involvement in Charlottesville and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the violent clashes at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, a closer examination of the self-described \"anti-fascists\" (or \"antifa\") at the rally has revealed their significant role in the escalating political violence in the United States. While many establishment political figures have compared these far-left actors to American soldiers on D-Day, their own statements suggest a very different narrative.\n\nFar from protecting America's system of government, these \"anti-fascists\" have declared their intention to disrupt the political process as much as possible, as evidenced by their actions at events such as the violent, politically motivated riots in Berkeley and the Charlottesville rally.\n\nOne of the far-left groups at the forefront of these disruptions is Refuse Fascism, a group that was a driving force behind the riots in Berkeley and the Charlottesville rally. Refuse Fascism urged confrontation with white nationalists, declaring, \"Drive them OUT of Charlottesville and out of power!\"\n\nRefuse Fascism was not the only far-left fringe group at Charlottesville. Another group, CrimethInc, holds that anarchism is necessary to destroy white supremacy, which the group says cannot be fully extinguished in a democracy. The group's statements call for the dismantling of the existing political and economic structures, including the state, capitalism, and the police.\n\nAnother far-left group at Charlottesville was the Workers World Party, a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group that has declared its support for the murderous dictatorships in North Korea and Venezuela. Workers World took credit for organizing the vandals who toppled a city-owned Confederate statue in Durham, North Carolina this week.\n\nThe Workers World Party's stated goals are classic Marxism, including igniting an international socialist revolution and \"the shutdown of the Pentagon and the use of the war budget\" to improve the lives of the working class. The group is opposed to all in the \"ruling establishment\" who they explain hide \"behind a veil of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'\"\n\nWhile Workers World is currently fighting (literally) with white nationalists, the group is opposed to all in the \"ruling establishment\" who they explain hide \"behind a veil of 'democracy' and 'human rights.'\"\n\nThese far-left groups' actions and statements raise questions about their true intentions and the extent to which they are willing to disrupt the political process in the United States. As the nation grapples with the aftermath of Charlottesville and the ongoing political divide, it is crucial to understand the role these groups are playing in the escalating violence and disruption.",

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has called on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to publicly address the ongoing controversy surrounding her use of a personal email server for government business. Feinstein expressed her concern that Clinton's silence on the matter could potentially harm her political standing.\n\nDuring the interview, Feinstein stated, \"I want to see Secretary Clinton come forward and tell the public just what the situation is.\" She emphasized Clinton's current status as the \"pre-eminent political figure\" in the political landscape, outpolling other potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2016 and also leading most Republicans in polls.\n\nFeinstein continued, \"Secretary Clinton should step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is.\" Clinton's handling of government business through a private email server set up in her Chappaqua, New York home has led to criticism and speculation about the security of the information transmitted.\n\nClinton has so far only addressed the issue through a late-night tweet on March 4, calling for the Justice Department to release her emails \"as soon as possible.\" However, Clinton did not address the issue during an event in Coral Gables, Florida, for the Clinton Global Initiative University over the weekend.\n\nIn a separate development, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who also used a personal email account during his tenure at the department in the first George W. Bush administration, stated that he has retained none of the emails sent from his personal account. Powell explained, \"I do not have any to turn over. I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off.\"\n\nPowell added, \"A lot of the emails that came out of my personal account went into the State Department system. They were addressed to State Department employees and the State.gov domain. But I do not know if the servers (for) the State Department captured those or not.\"\n\nPowell further stated that all the emails from his account were unclassified and most were \"pretty benign,\" so he is not overly concerned if they were recovered. This development comes as the email controversy surrounding Clinton continues to unfold, with the former Secretary of State turning over all relevant emails\u2014totaling 55,000 pages\u2014to the State Department for review.",
    " Title: UN Warns of Imminent Humanitarian Crisis in Syrian City of Kobani as Islamic State Nears Takeover\n\nArticle:\n\nA UN official has issued a dire warning of impending humanitarian tragedies in the Syrian city of Kobani, located near the Turkish border, as Islamic State (IS) fighters stand on the brink of taking it. Kurdish refugees from villages across northern Syria have fled to Kobani for a final stand, as the terrorist group has rampaged across vast territories, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake.\n\nFor three weeks, the city has been under siege, with IS militants raising their flag over neighborhoods. UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stated that the city is on the verge of falling. \"The world has seen with its own eyes the images of what happens when a city in Syria or in Iraq is overtaken by ISIS or Da'esh: massacres, humanitarian tragedies, rapes, horrific violence,\" De Mistura said. \"The international community cannot sustain another city falling under ISIS.\"\n\nWith fighting taking place in view of the Turkish border, international pressure has increased on Ankara to intervene militarily. Turkey, which has already taken in an estimated 200,000 refugees, has called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition, which is fighting both extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nThe capture of Kobani would give IS control of a large swath of land bordering Turkey and eliminate a vital pocket of Kurdish resistance. It would also provide a link between the group's territory near the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo and its largest operations base at Raqqa in northeastern Syria.\n\nWarplanes, believed to be part of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, have struck militant positions in Kobani, with occasional gunfire and explosions heard in the city. Despite U.S. pressure to become a full-fledged member of the coalition, Turkey has largely stayed on the sidelines, focusing on controlling the flow of Kurdish refugees and dealing with their protests.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Kobani is dire, with an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 people having fled into Turkey since the IS advance began. Thousands of Syrian Kurds, including women and children, have been evacuated from the city amidst the fighting. The UN, the U.S., and other international organizations are urging the world to act now to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Kobani.",
    " Title: Venezuela's Political Stalemate: Juan Guaido's Call for Change Meets Resistance Amidst Global Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of South America, the political landscape of Venezuela remains unchanged as opposition leader Juan Guaido's call for mass protests to oust President Nicolas Maduro has resulted in a significant display of public discontent, but with little tangible progress towards regime change. Guaido, who is recognized as the legitimate interim head of state by several nations, including the United States, the European Union, and others, urged millions of Venezuelans to take to the streets in what he termed the \"largest march\" in the country's history.\n\nHowever, by late afternoon on Wednesday, many protesters in the capital, Caracas, had returned home. National Guards fired tear gas at a hardcore group of demonstrators who remained, and one injured demonstrator was carried by others to a first aid truck, according to footage obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588. A young woman was reported dead after being shot in the head during a protest in Caracas, and Guaido confirmed via Twitter that a woman had died after being shot.\n\nThe standoff in Venezuela has escalated tensions between the United States and Russia, with each accusing the other of interference in the OPEC-member nation's affairs. Despite Guaido's calls for the military to support him, the armed forces leadership has remained loyal to Maduro, who has been in power since the death of his mentor, the late President Hugo Chavez, in 2013.\n\n\"If the regime thought we had reached maximum pressure, they can not even imagine,\" Guaido told thousands of cheering supporters. \"We have to remain in the streets.\"\n\nAs the crisis in Venezuela continues, the opposition's strategy of staging massive street protests against Maduro has failed to dislodge him despite a deep economic recession and hyperinflation. Demonstrators remain hopeful, with many prepared for the process of ousting Maduro to be a long-term endeavor.\n\n\"We need to keep going,\" said Laila Amezquita, a 52-year-old nurse from Caracas' downtown Candelaria district. \"In three months, Guaido's been able to do what they have not done in 20 years, and one has to be patient.\"\n\nOthers are frustrated that nothing has changed more than three months after Guaido, head of the opposition-run National Assembly, invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\nThe political impasse in Venezuela has put the country at the center of global geopolitical tensions, with the United States imposing sanctions on the Maduro government and refusing to rule out military intervention, although it prefers a peaceful transition. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox Business Network that military action is possible, but the Pentagon has downplayed any active preparations to directly intervene in Venezuela.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Pompeo on Wednesday that further \"aggressive steps\" in Venezuela would have grave consequences, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry. In response, the United States has accused Moscow of interfering in Venezuela, an ally of Russia since the time of Chavez.\n\nAs the political crisis deepens, living standards in Venezuela have declined even further, with blackouts, water shortages, and chronic shortages of food and medicine prompting millions to emigrate. Triple the usual daily number of Venezuelans fled across the border to Brazil on Tuesday, according to Brazilian government data.\n\nMaduro, who accuses Guaido of being a puppet of the United States seeking to orchestrate a coup, also called a march on Wednesday. In a speech to supporters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro said he recognized the need for \"big changes within the Bolivarian revolution.\" He did not provide details.\n\nAs the political stalemate persists, the people of Venezuela continue to grapple with the consequences of their country's political and economic crisis.",
    " Title: Urgency Mounts as Ebola Cases Rise in Guinea, Aid Workers Step Up Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the West African nation of Guinea, aid workers are intensifying their efforts to combat a resurgence of the deadly Ebola virus. The disease, which has been largely contained in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia, has seen a worrying increase in cases, prompting concerns that the upcoming rainy season could hinder access to remote villages where the virus continues to spread.\n\n\"I'm nervous but optimistic that Guinea will follow the same trajectory as Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the disease has declined,\" said Jordan Tappero, director of the division of global health protection for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He added that the number of personnel on the ground in Guinea has been tripled, and many other organizations are taking similar steps.\n\nSince the Ebola outbreak began in Guinea's jungles in December 2013, nearly 25,000 people across West Africa have been infected, with more than 10,000 deaths. The latest weekly total of new cases, reported during the week of March 15, was the highest for the nation so far this year, at 95. However, this week, only 45 new cases were reported, a figure that still concerns World Health Organization (WHO) workers due to the emergence of new infections in unexpected areas.\n\nMany of the outbreaks are in distant villages, and only 38% of new infections in Guinea last week were among people being tracked. This is a concerning figure because it indicates that healthcare workers are not effectively establishing a chain of infection, a crucial element in defeating the virus. The process of contact tracing, or tracking all those who have been exposed, is essential to breaking the chain of infection and halting the disease.\n\nTracing contacts in new infections will become increasingly difficult during the rainy season, which is expected to begin in June and bring daily downpours by July. \"That's why we have to get down to as close to zero with contact tracing all known, laboratory-confirmed cases by then,\" said Tappero. \"I'll be honest with you, people are fatigued.\"\n\nIn nearby Sierra Leone, where over 3,700 have died and almost 12,000 were infected, the nation's 6 million residents have been ordered to stay home for three days beginning Friday, except for religious services, in an effort to curb the spread of the disease, according to the Associated Press.\n\nEarlier this month, an American health worker, who is currently in critical condition at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, was evacuated from Sierra Leone after falling ill with Ebola. The worker was one of 12 new Ebola infections involving caregivers in Sierra Leone and Guinea in the past few weeks. Nearly 500 healthcare workers across West Africa have died of the disease since the outbreak began. In Guinea, the workers affected are often the only nurse or doctor in a remote village.\n\n\"We really need the rate of healthcare infections to be zero,\" said Ian Norton, a physician with the World Health Organization.\n\nNew infections in Sierra Leone are slowly diminishing, WHO reported. Last week, 84% of the 33 new cases were among people health officials were tracking\u2014good news, WHO said, because it shows health workers are successfully identifying and isolating those who might become infected.\n\nIn Liberia, infections fell dramatically, dropping to zero for three straight weeks this month. Beaches and schools re-opened, and students showed up to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands before entering class. More than 4,200 of those killed by the virus were in Liberia, where President Obama deployed about 3,000 troops to build clinics and train health care workers late last year. About 300 troops remain there.\n\nThere has been at least one setback. A ban on sporting activities was lifted, and the first soccer match was underway in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, on March 20, with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in attendance when word of a new Ebola case broke. A 44-year-old mother of six who worked as a food server at a school fell ill. She rode on a motorbike-taxi to the hospital, a common means of transportation in Monrovia. One small school where she worked has been temporarily closed. Eighty-six people who were in contact with her have been quarantined. The woman died on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is investigating whether the disease might have been transmitted through sexual contact with an Ebola survivor. Although the man she was dating was released from care more than three months before, research has found that the virus can survive in male sexual organs for an extended period of time.\n\n\"We were getting close to the finishing line when this sad event occurred,\" said Liberian government spokesman Isaac Jackson. \"We are all saddened by this development. But we are consoled because we have in place the best system, surveillance, contact tracers, so we are still committed to beating this virus.\"",
    " Title: \"Federal Election Commission Receives Complaint Against Rep. Ilhan Omar Over Campaign Funds Use\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN), alleging that she and her campaign violated the prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by reimbursing political consultant Tim Mynett for his travel in 2019. The complaint also alleges that Omar and her campaign failed to itemize the travel reimbursements, as required.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Mynett's formal relationship with Rep. Omar's campaign began in July 2018, with the payment of $7000 directly to Mynett. However, the reimbursements for Mynett's travel did not commence until April 2019, the same month that Dr. Mynett's divorce filing alleges her husband told her of the affair and made a'shocking declaration of love' for Rep. Omar.\n\nThe complaint states that Mynett's \"more recent travel and long work hours now appear to be more related to his affair with Rep. Omar than his actual work commitments.\" It also notes an oddity in the timing of Omar's funds spent on Mynett's firm, The E Street Group. The majority of these funds were paid after Omar won the contested primary and during the noncompetitive general election in her D+26 district. Contrary to FEC rules, Omar's filings did not designate whether her E Street Group disbursements (or any of her disbursements) were for the primary election or the general election.\n\nRep. Omar has refused to discuss her \"personal life\" and has not commented on the issue of campaign funds being improperly used. In June, Omar was ordered to pay back thousands of dollars to her campaign after breaking campaign finance laws.\n\nThis is a developing story and further details are expected to emerge in the coming days. The FEC will review the complaint and determine if an investigation is warranted.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Prioritize Political Bases Over Policy Initiatives in 2014\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, both President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have opted to shelve high-profile initiatives in 2014, prioritizing the needs of their respective political bases.\n\nFor the Republican speaker, a long-standing commitment to significant immigration changes, including a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers, was abandoned after it became clear that a conservative backlash was imminent. The conservative argument was that turning out conservatives is crucial for the 2014 midterm success, and big immigration changes would antagonize the base.\n\nSimilarly, President Obama has dropped a proposal from his new budget that he emphasized as essential just a year ago - a more modest calculation of inflation adjustments for Social Security. This change was a critical piece of entitlement reform and deficit reduction last year. However, in 2014, the calculation is simple: liberals oppose the idea, and pushing it could anger a base that the Democrats need in November.\n\nWhen Boehner retreated on immigration, it was the White House and its allies who criticized him for being shortsighted and prioritizing politics over the national interest. Now, the flipside, from Boehner's office, is that the President has no interest in addressing the looming debt crisis, and is already giving up for the remainder of his term.\n\nBoth leaders' decisions have been met with criticism from organizations focused on deficit reduction and structural budget reforms. The Campaign to Fix the Debt, for instance, stated that Obama's decision to abandon the Social Security change this year is a dangerous trend, reflecting a shift away from focusing on the nation's medium and long-term fiscal challenges.\n\nAs the battle for control of the Senate is the significant 2014 struggle, and the President has made clear that protecting the fragile Democratic majority there is his top priority, it seems that leadership in both parties is moving away from any environment of major policy compromise and toward full-scale election positioning.\n\nIn an effort to protect Democratic seats, President Obama will attend a 2014 Organizing for Action summit on Tuesday. The organization is the grassroots offshoot of the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaign, with the summit's goal being to defy the midterm historical odds and protect Democratic seats. The so-called \"chained CPI\" shift for Social Security will likely return as a debating point next year, but Obama could face even more choices anathema to liberals if the GOP manages to take control of the Senate.",
    " Title: Michael Bloomberg's Late Entry into the 2020 Democratic Primary Race: Opportunity or Obstacle?\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is reportedly considering a late entry into the 2020 Democratic primary race, capitalizing on the perceived struggles of frontrunner Joe Biden. The billionaire businessman, known for his centrist policy-making, is seen as an establishment favorite, potentially challenging Biden's position and offering an alternative to the more progressive candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBiden, who has expressed his desire to be president multiple times over the past decade, has been facing challenges in the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. His polling numbers have been slipping, with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders gaining ground, and Pete Buttigieg also posing a threat. This decline in support is particularly concerning for Biden, given his long political career, including eight years as Barack Obama's vice president and over 30 years in the Senate.\n\nCompounding Biden's financial struggles, he has been unable to match the war chests of Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg. The trio ended September with over $20 million each, while Biden had less than $9 million. This significant cash deficit means Biden will likely be outspent by his rivals in terms of television advertising and organizational efforts once the race moves beyond the first four states.\n\nThe perceived weakness of Biden's campaign has opened up an opportunity for Buttigieg, who has positioned himself in the same pragmatic lane as the former vice president. There are signs that Buttigieg is gaining momentum, particularly in Iowa, where he is starting to move upward in the polls. However, there are doubts about whether the Democratic establishment is ready to back a 37-year-old whose most significant political experience to date has been as mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nEnter Michael Bloomberg, an establishment darling with a net worth estimated at over $50 billion. Bloomberg's potential entry into the race is largely driven by the perceived weakness of Biden's campaign and the fear of a rising Elizabeth Warren, who is seen as the most liberal candidate in the field. Bloomberg believes this creates a realistic opportunity for him to become the nominee or at least have a strong chance at winning.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bloomberg's candidacy is not without its challenges. On paper, Biden is stronger, particularly among working-class and minority voters, groups that Bloomberg may struggle to appeal to initially. It remains to be seen whether Bloomberg can turn this window of opportunity into a successful campaign. The question for Bloomberg is whether he has enough time to build a strong organization, secure enough support, and overcome the challenges posed by the more established candidates in the race.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Agreement in Sight as Government Shutdown Threat Recedes; Immigration Remains Stalemate\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A bipartisan budget agreement appears to be within reach, as lawmakers work to avoid a repeat of last month's government shutdown. However, President Donald Trump's unexpected comments about the possibility of another shutdown if he cannot secure his immigration policy preferences have created uncertainty.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump stated, \"I'd love to see a shutdown if we can't get this stuff taken care of.\" This statement contrasted with the progress being made on Capitol Hill, where the House passed a short-term spending measure on Tuesday night, and Senate leaders were closing in on a broader, long-term pact before a Thursday deadline.\n\nThe broader agreement, if finalized, would provide significant spending increases for both the Pentagon and domestic federal programs, as well as approve overdue disaster relief money and potentially crucial legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit and prevent a possible default.\n\nDemocratic leaders have abandoned their strategy of using the funding fight to secure concessions on immigration, particularly regarding the extension of protections for \"Dreamer\" immigrants who have lived in the country illegally since they were children. Instead, Democrats are preparing to strike a deal that would allocate substantial funds for other priorities, such as combating opioid abuse, while taking their chances on resolving the immigration impasse later.\n\nThe House's 245-182 vote on Tuesday, largely along party lines, set the stage for the machinery to move forward. The six-week stopgap spending bill includes increases for the military that have long been demanded by Trump and his Republican allies. However, the measure is increasingly likely to be rewritten by the Senate to include legislation implementing the emerging broader budget agreement.\n\nHouse Democrats canceled a scheduled three-day retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore to develop a strategy for the midterm elections. A spokeswoman attributed the cancellation to \"the pressing issues Congress will likely vote on over the next three days.\"\n\nBudget negotiations, led primarily by Senate leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), have intensified in recent days, with the looming government shutdown at midnight Thursday adding urgency to the talks. In addition to the military and domestic spending, the deal in the works would also approve overdue disaster relief money and potentially crucial legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit and prevent a possible default.\n\n\"I think we're on the way to getting an agreement and getting it very soon,\" said McConnell.\n\nHowever, prospects for addressing immigration remain unclear. The Senate is scheduled to begin a debate next week to address the plight of immigrants left vulnerable by the impending expiration of former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nWeeks of negotiations have left the two parties divided over how to extend protections for such Dreamer immigrants and a court ruling has blurred the March 5 deadline.\n\nMcConnell stated on Tuesday that while he hopes \"we will end up having something,\" he was unsure if any proposed measure would garner the 60 votes needed for approval.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly fueled the immigration dispute as he defended Trump's proposed solution. The retired general noted that the White House proposal would expand protection for some 1.8 million immigrants. This group includes both the 690,000 currently shielded and also \"the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn't sign up,\" he said.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), his party's chief immigration negotiator, bristled at the comment.\n\n\"I'm sorry for that characterization. It doesn't surprise me from Gen. Kelly,\" he said.\n\nGOP defense hawks are prevailing over the party's depleted ranks of deficit hawks, championing significant new spending on military programs. Meanwhile, Democrats are leveraging their influence to increase spending for domestic priorities such as combating opioid misuse.\n\nThe result could be the return of trillion-dollar deficits for the first time since Obama's first term.\n\nThe stopgap spending bill would keep the government open through March 23 to allow time to write and pass detailed follow-up \"omnibus\" legislation to fund the government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe prospective longer-term budget agreement would provide relief from a budget freeze for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies, which lawmakers say threatens military readiness and training as well as domestic priorities such as combating opioid abuse and repairing the government's troubled health care system for veterans.\n\nThe temporary funding measure would also reauthorize funding for community health centers, which enjoy widespread bipartisan support.\n\nAides in both parties said the budget measure may also contain a provision to raise the government's $20.5 trillion borrowing limit. Legislation to increase the debt ceiling is always a headache, especially for House GOP leaders whose rank and file have, in the past, used the votes to register an objection to deficit spending.\n\nAnother likely addition is more than $80 billion in long-overdue hurricane relief for Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, a top priority for lawmakers in both parties.\n\nUnder Congress's arcane ways, a broad-brush agreement to increase legally binding spending \"caps\"\u2014which would otherwise keep the budgets for the military and domestic agencies essentially frozen\u2014would be approved, followed by a far more detailed catchall spending bill that would take weeks to negotiate.\n\nIt's clear that Senate Democrats have no appetite for another government shutdown. Their unity splintered during last month's three-day closure.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had linked progress on the budget with action to address the immigration program, but other Democrats are beginning to agitate for delinking the two, lest the opportunity for a budget pact is lost. And having tried and failed to link progress on the budget to DACA during last month's government shutdown battle, many Democrats aren't eager for a repeat.\n\n\"It's hard. If we can get a good deal that funds disaster relief, funds domestic priorities, funds the opioid crisis, it would be a difficult call,\" said Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA). \"DACA's important and it ought to get done. But what's the path?\"\n\nSchumer said he and Pelosi are \"working from the same page,\" appearing to discount speculation that she might oppose the coming pact.",
    " Title: Military Leaders Express Concern Over Trump's Sudden Decision to Ban Transgender Personnel\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by the announcement. Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military.\n\nThe U.S. President's decision has drawn criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday. \"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either,\" one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible.\"\n\nRights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands. The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.\n\nDunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders, and senior enlisted leaders. \"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President,\" Dunford wrote. \"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,\" Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.\n\nDunford's message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford, in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was \"unexpected.\" The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people. His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans. The White House said Trump had \"extensive discussions with his national security team,\" and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.\n\nTrump cited \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference. The Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army. \"I will be candid. This is a complex issue, and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with, but this is not clean-cut either way,\" he said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out. Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took. Trump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue. Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join. But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say. \"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,\" said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists. Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status. \"I try to be tough about it,\" he said, but added: \"It breaks your spirit down.\" One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted. \"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from,\" the officer said by phone. \"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today's military. Our service personnel today don't give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts.\"",
    " Title: The Impact of Marijuana Legalization on the Media Landscape: A New Era of Pot-Fueled Advertising and Content\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impending legalization of marijuana, as advocated by The New York Times in a historic editorial last week, is set to create a consumer product as sought-after as cigarettes and alcohol. This development, with its potential to generate substantial tax revenue and fill gaps in state budgets, could prove to be a gold mine for the media industry.\n\nAs the marijuana industry emerges, it could become as prolific an advertiser as the cigarette industry was in its heyday. With the legalization of marijuana, at least on some level, implies the legalization of its marketing. It would seem counterproductive to forbid marijuana manufacturers from advertising, especially once it starts generating significant tax revenue.\n\nOn Sunday, The New York Times ran a full-page ad for Leafly, a company that bills itself as \"the world's largest information resource about cannabis\" and \"the Yelp of cannabis.\" This move signifies the potential for a burgeoning marijuana market and the advertising opportunities it presents.\n\nThe legalization of marijuana could transform the media business, with the nascent marijuana industry likely to argue for the right to advertise, an argument that, if successful, could revitalize the media industry. In fact, a shrewd investment strategy might be to go long on media stocks in anticipation of the end of the marijuana prohibition.\n\nHowever, even if the federal government, lagging behind state governments like those in Colorado and Washington, accepts the premise that marijuana's \"casual use by adults poses little or no risk for healthy people,\" there might still be a public policy argument about age-appropriate marketing. Strict regulators and politicians trying to save face will likely take this view.\n\nThis presents another media opportunity. Restricting marijuana advertising to print media, and hence to adults (mature adults!), might not only be a way to protect the young, but a compromise with positive social implications as well.\n\nThe legalization of marijuana, no matter how logical, timely, and righteous, also involves a set of trade-offs. By accepting the realities of science and consumer demand, we might end up with a vaguer, less intellectually stimulating nation.\n\nLimiting marijuana advertising to print media performs a public policy balancing act. The potential loss of intellectual focus could coincide with a pot-financed renaissance in print media, a resurgence of reading, and even linear thought.\n\nAt the same time, such targeted advertising might lead to a growth industry in media focused on marijuana. There are broader content implications and opportunities related to marijuana. An ever-growing media problem is the difficulty of reaching the rich market of young men who are distracted by video games and, arguably, marijuana itself.\n\nVice Media, the video content company that specializes in these otherwise inattentive young men, has recently been valued at $2 billion\u2014so the opportunity is vast. Seeing pot culture and behavior more openly expressed by traditional media\u2014in the way, for instance, that it is expressed in so many YouTube videos\u2014might reestablish that lost connection between mainstream media and the young.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, in addition to cigarettes being commonplace on television, there was also a general acceptance, if not celebration, of being drunk. Many variety shows featured hosts with ties askew holding an old-fashioned glass with clinking ice. The rat pack, or rat pack style, dominated television for a decade, and was mostly about singing and clowning around when drunk. Arguably, the media have never had such a connection to their audience as when they embraced and acted out drunkenness.\n\nPot, or pot style, could become part of what is now called content marketing\u2014i.e., using your content to create a symbiotic marketing environment. The closer you can come to representing pot sensibility, the closer you might be to a sweet spot demographic and to attracting the range of products that are willing to pay a premium to reach this group of people, perhaps easier to appeal to and influence precisely because they are high\u2014a double marketing wallop. By this logic, most media might become pot-partial.\n\nOne of the problems with contemporary media is not only the enormous number of outlets competing for the attention of American consumers, but also the fact that, beyond sports, there is no central focus, no common experience, that reliably brings us all together. We each pursue our own varied interests, styles, and politics, creating enormous chaos and costs for marketers.\n\nPot, as the great leveler and unifying cultural principle, could change that.",
    " Title: American and Somali-American Teenagers Arrested Upon Return from Attempted Journey to Syria to Join ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that have raised concerns about the attractiveness of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to Western youth, three teenage girls, two of Somali descent and one of Sudanese descent, were arrested upon their return to the United States after attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS.\n\nThe first indication that something was amiss was a phone call from the Denver area school to Assad Ibrahim, the father of one of the girls, informing him that she had not come to class. Ibrahim dialed her cell, but she did not tell him that she was on her way to Syria. Instead, she claimed she was late for class. According to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, which filed a runaway report, the girl also kept quiet about her two friends, Americans of Somali descent, who were flying with her to Turkey by way of Germany. Those two had told their father, Ali Farah, that they were going to the library.\n\nWhen Farah returned home from work, a visitor came calling, according to the documents. It was Ibrahim. Farah was advised to check to see if his daughters' passports were missing, just like his daughter's passport was. Sure enough, they were gone, along with $2,000 in cash. The two families called the FBI, stating they thought the girls were on their way to Turkey.\n\nGerman authorities intercepted the trio, ages 15, 16, and 17, at Frankfurt airport and put them on a plane back to the United States, where they were greeted by FBI agents. The three girls were questioned and released. Two U.S. officials say they had planned to join militants with ISIS.\n\nThe girls' parents claim they had no idea their children planned to travel. None of them had ever run away before. Their disappearance hit them out of the blue, much like other ISIS-related incidents popping up in the Western world. Two more such incidents occurred in tandem with the girls' runaway attempt.\n\nOn Monday, a radical convert to Islam in Canada ran down two soldiers in his car, killing one of them. Martin Rouleau Couture, 25, then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in the town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, southeast of Montreal. Back in July, Couture, too, had tried to join foreign jihad, and Canadian police arrested him on his way to Turkey. However, they could not charge him and had to let him go.\n\nThis week, a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders, including President Obama, then fly the ISIS flag over the White House.\n\nISIS has, for an anti-Western organization, been surprisingly attractive to young recruits from the West, as well as to some young women. More than 100 of the foreign fighters have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates; hundreds more from Europe, which is geographically closer to the fight. Every week, five more people from the UK alone join ISIS, a British police commissioner said Tuesday.\n\nThe investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges, especially because the girls are minors, the two U.S. officials said. On Monday, Sheriff's Deputy Evan Driscoll visited the two girls of Somali descent in their home and had a conversation with them. \"The girls explained that they stole the $2,000 and their passports from their mother,\" he wrote in the runaway report. The deputy called dispatchers and had the girls' runaway listing removed.\n\nInvestigators are also not sure the girls had even worked out the final goal for their travel. As was the case with the Canadian, Couture, the investigation into the travel will probably not lead to charges, especially because the girls are minors, the two U.S. officials said.",
    " Title: President Obama's Approval Rating Hits Record Low in New Poll, Healthcare Overhaul Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's approval rating has plummeted to a record low of 37 percent in a new poll released Wednesday by CBS News, marking the lowest approval rating of his presidency. Simultaneously, the disapproval rating reached a high of 57 percent.\n\nThe president's approval of his healthcare overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, has hit an all-time low of 31 percent, with 61 percent disapproving. The administration is currently grappling with the fallout from a rocky rollout of major parts of the law on October 1. Forty-six percent of respondents strongly disapprove of the law.\n\nThe poll indicates a significant drop in approval among independents, falling from 38 percent to 27 percent, and among Democrats, dropping from 74 percent to 58 percent. Conversely, 88 percent of Republicans disapprove of the law, with little change from last month's 87 percent figure.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans surveyed believe the signup process for insurance on government health care exchanges is not going well, and nearly two-thirds are not confident that the federal HealthCare.gov website will be mostly fixed by December 1. White House press secretary Jay Carney stated that a goal of 80 percent recruitment among all users of the website would be nearly the best result possible.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney explained, \"I think the way to look at that figure is that of, say, 10 who go on the system, roughly two won't get through the system.\" He added that the 20 percent who can't enroll includes people who aren't \"comfortable\" signing up online or have personal circumstances that are too \"complex\" to use the website.\n\nDespite the negative sentiment towards Obamacare, a majority of Americans do not favor outright repeal of the law. Seven percent think it's working well and should be kept as is, 48 percent think some changes are needed, and 43 percent think it should be repealed.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign last fall, 60 percent of voters thought of Mr. Obama as honest and trustworthy, compared to 49 percent of Americans in the poll released Wednesday.\n\nAmericans hold dim views of both parties in Congress; just 26 percent approve of how congressional Democrats are doing their job, and 21 percent say the same for congressional Republicans. The mark for Democrats is down slightly from last month's 31 percent, and Republicans ticked up from 18 percent. Disapproval of Democrats increased from 65 percent to 68 percent, and disapproval of Republicans declined from 78 percent to 73 percent.\n\nThe CBS News poll of 1,010 adults was conducted from November 15-18 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",
    " Title: Analysis: Bergdahl's Release and the Political Fallout: A Look at the Controversy Surrounding the U.S. Army Sergeant's Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's release from Taliban captivity, the political landscape has become a battleground, with the Republican party facing criticism for their response to the event. The controversy revolves around the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture, his time in captivity, and the five Taliban prisoners released in exchange for his freedom.\n\nThe release of Bergdahl, a prisoner of war since 2009, has sparked a heated debate, with Republicans criticizing President Obama's decision to negotiate with the Taliban. If President George W. Bush, President McCain, or President Romney had secured Bergdahl's release, Republicans would likely be defending the move, according to some analysts. However, the Obama administration's actions are being met with harsh criticism, with some Republicans questioning the price paid for Bergdahl's freedom and the message it sends to other terrorist groups.\n\nOne of the main criticisms leveled against the administration is that the release of five Taliban prisoners could embolden other terrorist groups. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers stated on Sunday that the deal sends a message to every al-Qaeda group in the world that there is value in taking an American hostage. However, this argument has been met with skepticism, as guerrilla forces have been taking hostages for centuries, and prisoner exchanges have occurred in Afghanistan in the past.\n\nAnother point of contention is the character of Bergdahl himself. A long profile of Bergdahl in Rolling Stone in 2012 by the late combat journalist Mike Hastings sheds light on Bergdahl's disillusionment with the military and his experiences in Afghanistan. Bergdahl's emails to his parents, which expressed disdain for the U.S. military and its actions in Afghanistan, have been used by some to question his patriotism and loyalty.\n\nAs the political fallout from Bergdahl's release continues, it remains to be seen how the controversy will play out in the coming months. Some analysts believe that the issue could become a central point in the 2016 election, with Republicans using it to attack President Obama and the administration's foreign policy. However, others argue that the American public values the return of a captured soldier and will view the event as a positive development, regardless of the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's capture and the price paid for his release.",
    " Title: \"Job Market Boom: A Look at the Current Employment Landscape and the Proposed Guaranteed Jobs Program\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a 26-year-old software developer, David Casarez, found himself in the limelight after he stood at an intersection in Mountain View, California, with a homemade cardboard sign reading \"Homeless \u2013 Hungry 4 Success \u2013 Take a Resume.\" Within a day, Casarez received over 200 job offers, highlighting the current robust job market.\n\nThe job market is currently experiencing a boom, with more job openings than job seekers. Employers who once demanded a college degree or experience are now dropping these requirements. Unemployment is near a fifty-year low, and unemployment among blacks and Hispanics is at a nearly all-time low.\n\nHowever, some Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), are campaigning for a \"guaranteed jobs\" program, seemingly disregarding the current economic conditions. This proposal is also being championed by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is running for Congress this fall. House Democrats introduced guaranteed job legislation last week.\n\nThese Democrats propose that the federal government should guarantee a job and a paycheck for anyone who isn't working, funded by taxpayers. To finance these make-work jobs and other programs, some Democrats, such as Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren, are advocating for undoing the Trump tax cuts, effectively sabotaging the policy credited for the economic boom.\n\nThe hiring surge is a direct result of a significant increase in business investment, up 9.4% during the first half of 2018. Investors are pouring money into private sector companies to buy more vehicles and equipment and increase commercial construction. This increased investment leads to more job opportunities in the private sector.\n\nThe proposed guaranteed jobs program, however, is not the solution to boost the nation's low labor participation rate. The U.S. already has 41 federal jobs programs costing a whopping $17 billion a year to push the long-term unemployed into the workforce, with little success to show for it.\n\nMake-work programs, like the ones proposed by Booker, Gillibrand, and other Democrats, have an abysmal record of getting people into lasting private sector jobs, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research survey by David Card of University of California Berkeley and co-authors.\n\nThe Democrats pushing for a federal job guarantee are not genuinely interested in ensuring people work, as evidenced by their opposition to work or work-readiness requirements for public benefits. Their job guarantee campaign is, in essence, a thinly disguised effort at radical income redistribution.\n\nIn conclusion, the current job market is booming, and the proposed guaranteed jobs program may not be the best solution for those seeking employment. Instead, the focus should be on maintaining policies that encourage business investment and job creation, such as the Trump tax cuts. For determined individuals like David Casarez, it's crucial to be aware of the potential consequences of the Democrats' tax hikes and redistributionist schemes, which could jeopardize the ongoing jobs boom.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Negotiations Intensify as Fiscal Cliff Looms: Democrats Press for Tax Increases, Republicans Push for Spending Cuts and Structural Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for avoiding the fiscal cliff approaches, top Democrats and Republicans are intensifying negotiations, with Democrats pressing for tax increases on the wealthy as part of a broader agreement, while Republicans are advocating for deeper, more permanent changes to the federal government's fiscal policies and structural changes such as a balanced-budget amendment and limits on government spending.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, stated unequivocally that she would not accept a deal without tax increases on the wealthy. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and other Republicans continue to reject outright tax increases but remain open to modifying the tax code and possibly eliminating some deductions, particularly those that benefit the rich.\n\nPresident Obama has softened his rhetoric in recent days, emphasizing the need for more revenue from the wealthy through closing loopholes or other means, rather than raising tax rates. Finding a middle ground that allows both parties to claim victory is crucial to reaching an agreement before the end of the year.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, described the ongoing discussions between the two sides as a window of opportunity, stating, \"You have to be careful. If you talk about taxes, [Republicans] run for the hills. But if you talk about revenue and tax reform, they sit still for that conversation.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans are also under pressure to address the root causes of the nation's fiscal problems, with young leaders in the party, such as new Republican Governors Association Chairman Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, urging the party to pursue structural changes such as a balanced-budget amendment and limits on government spending.\n\nThe back-and-forth between the two sides comes just two days after a meeting at the White House between President Obama and leaders from both parties. President Obama has called for any deal to include tax increases on families earning more than $250,000 per year, while insisting that tax cuts be preserved for families below that income level.\n\nSeveral Republicans have reiterated their preference for deep spending cuts over revenue increases, with Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho stating, \"What happens in Washington, D.C., is... we do an increase in taxes today, and we promise that there's going to be spending cuts 10 years from now. And it never happens.\"\n\nBoth parties are using similar arguments to attack the other's plan, with Democrats arguing that closing loopholes is insufficient to generate the necessary revenue, while Republicans argue that tax increases will not have a significant impact on deficit reduction.\n\nThe public is expecting \"tough compromises\" to be made, according to President Obama, who stated, \"What folks are looking for, and I think all of us agree on this, is action. They want to see that we are focused on them, not focused on our politics here in Washington.\" The challenge for both parties is to find common ground and build consensus to address the nation's fiscal challenges.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Accuses Attorney General Barr of Lying to Congress, Threatens Contempt Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi intensified her criticism of Attorney General William Barr on Thursday, accusing him of lying to lawmakers and threatening to hold him in contempt of Congress. The top Democrat in Congress also accused Barr of obstructing justice by refusing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe White House showed no sign of backing down, with White House legal counsel Emmet Flood stating that President Donald Trump had the right to tell advisers not to testify to congressional panels on the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nThe dueling statements marked a sharp escalation in the conflict between the White House and Democrats who control the House of Representatives. With Trump seeking re-election next year, Democrats are weighing whether to use the impeachment process to remove the Republican president from office while pressing forward with demands for information on his taxes, businesses, and other topics.\n\nPelosi's accusation came after Barr refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, citing a dispute over the hearing's format. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler threatened to hold Barr in contempt of Congress if he does not provide a full, unredacted copy of Mueller's report and the underlying evidence, as the panel has requested by a subpoena that had a Wednesday deadline.\n\nPelosi accused Barr of lying to lawmakers about interactions with Mueller after the special counsel ended a 22-month investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy.\n\n\"That's a crime,\" Pelosi told reporters, referring to Barr's congressional testimony.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Pelosi's allegation \"reckless, irresponsible, and false.\"\n\nDemocrats have accused Barr of misleading Congress by testifying in April that he was unaware of any concern by the special counsel's team about Barr's initial March 24 characterization of the report, an account that led Trump to claim full exoneration. Barr failed to mention a March 27 letter he received from Mueller complaining that Barr's March 24 account did not \"fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office's work.\"\n\nNadler has issued a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify in the investigation of possible obstruction of justice by the president. Trump told Fox News in an interview on Thursday he was not inclined to let McGahn testify before congressional committees.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks at her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 2, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nThe report detailed extensive contacts between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign's expectation that it would benefit from Russia's actions, which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The report also detailed a series of actions Trump took to try to impede the investigation.\n\nMueller, a former FBI director, concluded there was insufficient evidence to show a criminal conspiracy and opted not to make a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice, but pointedly did not exonerate him. Barr has said he and Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department's No. 2 official, then determined there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan and Sarah N.

    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Releases Final Report on 2016 Election, Finds No Collusion Between Trump Campaign and Russia\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has released its final report on the 2016 presidential election, concluding that there is no evidence of ties between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. The report, written by Republicans on the committee, does criticize \"poor judgment and ill-considered actions\" by Trump's campaign, as well as the campaign run by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe report states, \"While the Committee found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government, the investigation did find poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns.\" The committee had previously revealed in a one-page summary of the report's findings that it had found no evidence of collusion.\n\nThe report also notes that Russia did carry out a \"multi-faceted\" active measures campaign against the U.S. in an effort to \"sow fear and division in American society.\" The committee voted along party lines in March to release its controversial, Republican-authored report, wrapping up a yearlong investigation that was filled with contentious panel infighting.\n\nDemocrats were outraged by the unilateral GOP decision to end the investigation last month, calling the move premature and an attempt to shield the White House from scrutiny. In a statement, Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican who led the investigation, said, \"Today, [the House Intelligence Committee] is able to release a declassified version of our report on the Russia Investigation. With the public release of this report, the American people will have the opportunity to access the information used to draw the conclusions found in last month's findings and recommendations.\"\n\nHowever, Conaway expressed disappointment with the redactions made by the intelligence community, stating that many of the redactions include information that is publicly available, such as witness names and information previously declassified. He added that he would challenge the redactions going forward in the hope of releasing more information.\n\n\"When we started this investigation, we set out to give the American people the answers to the questions they've been asking and we promised to be as transparent as possible in our final report,\" Conaway said. \"I don't believe the information we're releasing today meets that standard, which is why my team and I will continue to challenge the [intelligence community's] many unnecessary redactions with the hopes of releasing more of the report in the coming months.\"",
    " Title: Republicans Propose Permanent Individual Income Tax Cuts, Amidst Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - In the lead-up to the upcoming congressional elections, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have proposed a new round of deficit-expanding tax cuts, a move that some tax experts view as a political strategy rather than a legislative certainty.\n\nThe proposed measures, dubbed \"Tax Reform 2.0,\" aim to make permanent the individual income tax cuts temporarily approved in December 2017 by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. The package also includes the elimination of the maximum age for some retirement account contributions and the allowance for new businesses to write off more start-up costs.\n\nHouse Tax Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the main author of the \"Tax Reform 2.0\" package, plans to put it to a committee-level vote on Thursday, with a full House vote expected by October 1.\n\nThe tax cuts passed in December are projected to add an estimated $1.5 trillion over a decade to the federal deficit, the difference between Washington's spending and the taxes it collects. The new round being proposed by Republicans would add a further $576 billion to the deficit, even taking possibly higher economic growth into account, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank in Washington.\n\nDemocrats, who argue that the previous cuts mainly benefited the wealthy and corporations, have criticized the new proposal. In a statement on Monday, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said, \"With version 2.0 of the GOP tax scam for the rich, Republicans want to add even more to the deficit, and even more to the bank accounts of the wealthiest 1 percent.\"\n\nThe political implications of the proposal are significant, as it could potentially place Democrats in a position of opposing the new tax-cut plan on the House floor, a move that Republicans could use to their advantage in the November 6 elections where control of Congress will be at stake.\n\nHowever, the proposal's passage is uncertain, with some analysts viewing it as a political maneuver rather than a legislative certainty. The investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods stated in a Monday note to clients, \"Regardless of the merits of the House GOP plan, we view it as a political move ahead of the midterm elections that has no chance of passing Congress in the short term.\"\n\nEven so, Republican lawmakers and strategists hope a new tax debate will amplify the party's upbeat economic message. They point to a report by the Tax Foundation that forecasts the creation of 1.5 million jobs and wage increases if the temporary individual tax cuts are made permanent.\n\nHowever, some Republicans from Democratic-leaning states express concern about the cap on the federal deduction for state and local tax payments, known as SALT. A dozen House Republicans opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December. All but one were from high-tax Democratic states such as New York, New Jersey, and California. The new package would make the capped SALT deduction permanent.\n\nUnder Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the federal deficit has begun growing rapidly again and is expected to exceed $1 trillion in 2019. If that happens, it would be the first time since 2012 that the U.S. economy would have to support such a large deficit, highlighting a significant shift for the Republican Party, which once prided itself on fiscal conservatism.",
    " Title: Iran Threatens to Abandon Nuclear Agreement Amid Missile Test and U.S.-Iran Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between Iran and global powers are escalating as Iran has threatened to abandon the nuclear agreement reached last year, following a series of provocative actions by the Islamic Republic. According to a report by the Free Beacon's Adam Kredo, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, warned on Tuesday that Iran may walk away from the deal if its national interests are not met by the United States and other global powers.\n\nThe latest development comes after Iran breached international agreements by test-firing ballistic missiles on Monday, a move that violates current U.N. Security Council resolutions. The test follows the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) disclosure that it is prohibited by the nuclear agreement from publicly reporting on potential violations by Iran.\n\nIranian leaders have made it clear that they are prepared to walk away from the deal if the United States and other global powers fail to advance the Islamic Republic's interests. \"If our interests are not met under the nuclear deal, there will be no reason for us to continue,\" Araqchi stated during remarks delivered to a group of Iranian officials in Tehran.\n\nThe Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was in Europe in January, shoring up billions of dollars in new business deals following the lifting of sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal. If Iran were to walk away from the agreement, it would be challenging for Europe to cut ties entirely should new sanctions be imposed.\n\nHowever, the White House has stated that Iran's most recent missile test, the third since the Iran deal was announced, does not violate the nuclear agreement. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during the daily briefing that the United Nations is looking into whether Iran can be punished for violating other sanctions or agreements.\n\nThe escalating tensions between Iran and global powers highlight the delicate nature of the nuclear agreement and the potential for further conflict in the region. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Iran will follow through on its threat to abandon the deal and the potential consequences that may ensue.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Troubled Start: Navigating the Legacy of the Iraq War and the Bush Family Name\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early stages of his potential presidential campaign, Jeb Bush's biggest challenge has come to the forefront: distancing himself from his last name and the emotional ties to his brother, former President George W. Bush, particularly regarding the Iraq War.\n\nThis week, after three days of stumbling responses to a simple question, Bush finally admitted what many expected him to say from the outset. During a campaign stop in Tempe, Ariz., Bush stated that, given the current knowledge, he would not have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion, according to The Washington Post.\n\nBush explained that he had struggled with the question, as he didn't want to seem ungrateful for the sacrifices made by Americans during the war. However, the episode leaves lingering questions about Bush's willingness to distance himself from his brother in his expected 2016 bid for the presidency.\n\nRepublican candidates, including Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Hillary Clinton (Democratic candidate) have all stated they wouldn't have invaded. The Iraq War remains deeply unpopular with the American public, with 75% of respondents in a June 2014 CBS News/New York Times poll stating that the Iraq War was not worth the costs.\n\nOn Thursday, Bush walked back his comment, stating, \"I interpreted the question wrong, I guess.\" But when asked again, he demurred, saying, \"I don't know what that decision would have been. That's a hypothetical.\"\n\n\"'That's a hypothetical' is the all-purpose dodge any politician can deploy when they don't want to answer a question,\" says Ford O'Connell, author of \"Hail Mary: The 10-Step Playbook for Republican Recovery.\" \"He used one of them up.\"\n\nThe Iraq War is not the only issue that poses a challenge for Bush. The economic crisis at the end of his brother's tenure also looms large. Jeb Bush seems unwilling to throw his brother under the bus, even referring to his brother recently as an adviser on the Middle East, a comment he didn't disown in his interview with Megyn Kelly.\n\nThe real story, in fact, may be that Bush seemed to go out of his way to defend his brother on Iraq. George W. Bush seems acutely aware of the liability he poses to his brother. Last month, at an event in Chicago, he practically gave Jeb permission to disown his record.\n\n\"He does not need to defend me,\" the second President Bush said, according to Politico. He also acknowledged his mother's famous comment from 2013 \u2013 \"Haven't we had enough Bushes?\" \u2013 and said, \"That's why you won't see me out there\" on the campaign trail.\n\nJeb Bush's challenge is to present himself as a Republican of the future, not a man burdened by his family's past. With fresh faces like his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI) gaining positive notice in the early going, the battle is joined. But so far, Bush is still stumbling over the past.\n\nSome analysts suggest that Bush may be playing a different game \u2013 that he is just going to say what he thinks, stay true to his family, and let the chips fall where they may. Perhaps this is his way of running \"joyfully,\" as he described his possible campaign in early 2014. \"Let Jeb be Jeb\" is how Bush adviser Mike Murphy described the philosophy to The New York Times last December.\n\nWhether this brand of political authenticity will catch hold among Republican voters \u2013 and along with it, some of the Bush views that don't fit standard Republican orthodoxy at the moment \u2013 remains to be seen. If Bush somehow manages to bend the GOP in his direction, he could represent the party's future. But that's a big \"if.\"",
    " Title: Historians to Ponder Unprecedented Republican Presidential Race: Businessman Donald Trump Nears Major Party Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historical turn of events, American politics have witnessed an unprecedented shift in the Republican presidential race of 2016, with businessman Donald Trump coming close to capturing the nomination of a major national party for the first time in 75 years. This development, according to senior political analyst David Gergen, will be a topic of interest for historians as it marks a significant departure from traditional political trajectories.\n\nThe last time a businessman with no prior political experience won a major party's nomination was in 1940 when Wendell Willkie, head of a utilities holding company, stormed the GOP convention, winning on the sixth ballot. Willkie, a popular figure, ran a strong race against Franklin Roosevelt but ultimately lost by 10 points.\n\nHowever, the significance of Trump's rise to power transcends his business background. As an unconventional figure, Trump is poised to become the most unconventional candidate either party has put forward in modern times. Despite entering the general election as an underdog, there is a possibility that he could win the White House, a position of immense power and influence in a fractured world.\n\nIn the coming months, American voters, as well as media personnel, need to assess Trump's strengths and weaknesses more thoroughly, according to Gergen. While Trump has dominated the airwaves, the media and the public still do not know him as well as they should.\n\nWhat is evident so far is that millions of voters see in Trump a strong leader who can reverse the national direction, akin to a turnaround CEO. Voters often turn to candidates whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the sitting president. Thus, they elected Jimmy Carter due to his honesty, a sharp contrast to the Nixon years. They turned to Ronald Reagan as an antidote to Carter's vacillation. After eight years of George W. Bush's plain talk, voters were inspired by Barack Obama's soaring calls. Now, after the Obama years and a string of broken promises by their own leaders, many Republicans believe Trump understands their frustrations and will act decisively to address them. That he is unconventional and outrageous, to them, signifies realness, not phoniness.",
    " Title: Arizona Witnesses Increase in Measles Cases, Health Officials Warn of Potential Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo additional cases of measles were confirmed in Arizona on Tuesday, with public health officials warning that hundreds more people in the state may have been exposed this month. The outbreak, which has been linked to a family of four who recently visited Disneyland in California, has reached a critical point, according to Will Humble, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe two cases confirmed Tuesday, a man in Pinal County and a woman in Phoenix, were linked to the family whose measles cases were confirmed last week. Health officials believe the Phoenix-area woman, who was recently diagnosed with measles, may have exposed as many as 195 children to the disease at the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center on Jan. 20 and 21.\n\nMaricopa County officials are currently contacting the children's families, while a hospital official told 12 News that the woman was not an employee and it was not known why she was at the facility.\n\nHumble said that although officials have a list of people who were at the hospital, the problem is not knowing whether those exposed to the measles have had contact with other people in large gatherings or traveled outside their county.\n\n\"You spread it (the measles) before you feel bad,\" he said, adding that symptoms usually appear about a week after exposure.\n\nIn response to the confirmed case, Maricopa County health officials have recommended that all exposed children who have not had at least one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine stay home from school or daycare for the 21-day incubation period. Exposed adults who were born after 1957, have not had measles, or have had only one MMR vaccine, should not go to work or public places for the same 21-day period.\n\nHealth officials say two doses of the MMR vaccine provide full protection against measles.\n\nThe Pinal County case also raises the possibility of exposure for other residents or visitors in the area, as the man who is now recovering visited various public locations while still infectious. Officials have compiled a list of businesses where the man visited Thursday and Friday, including a Kearny, Ariz. gas station and post office.\n\nHumble said the state has been in contact with health workers across Arizona, alerting them to measles symptoms.\n\n\"For many clinicians, it's an illness they've never seen,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Pinal County health officials, measles begins with a fever, red and watery eyes, a cough, and a runny nose, followed by a red, raised, and blotchy rash that begins on the head at the hairline and moves to the lower extremities. Symptoms typically appear seven to 12 days after exposure to measles but may take up to 21 days.\n\nThe recent outbreak is thought to have originated at Disneyland before Christmas. The California Department of Public Health reported last week that the state has 59 confirmed cases, with 42 linked to Disneyland or California Adventure in Anaheim. The outbreak has spread to Washington, Utah, Colorado, Oregon, and Arizona.\n\nLast week, Maricopa County officials reported that a woman in her 50s tested positive for measles, which they believe she contracted at Disneyland.",
    " Title: Andrew Pollack Discusses Daughter's Death and School Safety in New Book, \"Why Meadow Died\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a candid interview with Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, Andrew Pollack, father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack, discussed his new book, \"Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America's Students.\" The book details Pollack's investigation into the events leading up to the massacre and his views on gun control, Democratic policies, and school safety.\n\nPollack expressed his desire to uncover the truth behind his daughter's death, stating, \"I wanted to know the facts. I didn't just listen to mainstream media, I didn't jump on that bandwagon -- and I found out that there was a multitude of failures and policies that led up to my daughter getting murdered, that the mainstream media didn't want to cover.\"\n\nIn the book, Pollack discusses his belief that new gun control laws are ineffective in addressing the school shooting epidemic. He argues that current laws are not being enforced, citing the Parkland shooter's violent record and his ability to obtain a weapon legally despite this.\n\n\"To me, gun control would\u2019ve been if they arrested him for punching his mother\u2019s teeth out and he got a background,\" explained Pollack. \"Democrats put these policies in place that don't believe in holding kids accountable or arresting them while they're juveniles...so if they do not arrest them and they do not get a background, then they're able to purchase weapons legally, and a background check is useless.\"\n\nPollack also criticized the lack of attention given to mental health and the failure to arrest individuals who make threats as underlying causes of school shootings. He expressed his disapproval of recent videos featuring 2020 Democratic candidates promoting tighter gun control as a safety precaution in schools, stating, \"My daughter paid the ultimate sacrifice because of those Democratic policies, and I've been hurt by the Democrats more than anybody in this country -- and I hold them responsible.\"\n\nPollack has met with President Trump five times and applauded the President's initiation of a federal school safety commission to investigate what steps need to be taken to ensure safety in schools across the country. In his book, Pollack aims to create a guide for parents to spot warning signs of potential shooters and to explain that Meadow's death was avoidable.\n\nFox News personality Neil Cavuto described the book as \"stunning and raw\" and dared viewers to \"read this book without a box of tissues.\" Pollack is committed to educating parents across the country on being alert and responsive to potential dangers surrounding their children.\n\n\"Every time that there\u2019s a mass shooting,\" he explained, \"I think about these victims...and I picture my daughter being a victim.\"\n\nTo watch the full interview with Tomi Lahren and Andrew Pollack, visit Fox Nation.

    " Title: Trump Faces Over 50 Lawsuits in First Two Weeks of Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first two weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump is facing more than 50 lawsuits over White House policies and personal business dealings. This is significantly more than his predecessors faced during their initial days in office. The lawsuits began on Inauguration Day and have not abated since.\n\nMost of the lawsuits, numbering over 50, are related to the travel ban on refugees and nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries that Trump implemented on January 27. The lawsuits have been filed in 17 different states by doctors, professors, students, individuals fleeing violence, and Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. military. Some were detained in American airports for hours over the weekend, while others were prevented from boarding planes bound for the U.S. Two Syrian brothers with visas to enter the country were turned away at Philadelphia International Airport and sent back to Damascus.\n\nHuman rights organizations and attorneys general in five states have joined some of the lawsuits, and their list of legal grievances is extensive. They allege violations of the First, Fifth, and 14th Amendments, which guarantee religious equality, due process, and equal protection under the law, as well as denials of asylum and discriminatory visa processing.\n\nSan Francisco is suing over Trump's directive to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities. Lawyers representing the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington are suing over Trump's alleged conflicts of interest. Deepak Gupta told NPR last week that the lawsuit could have broad implications.\n\n\"This is about testing the proposition that the framers really meant it when they said the president has to have undivided loyalty to the American people and should not have financial entanglements with foreign governments,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe White House is contesting all the lawsuits. Trump describes the ethics suit as \"without merit\" and argues that the immigration orders are necessary to ensure the country's safety.\n\nThis flurry of litigation far surpasses what other administrations faced at the same point. At the same point in Obama's presidency, his administration had been sued just five times. The George W. Bush White House faced only four.\n\n\"The Trump administration may set records in terms of the number of lawsuits filed against the administration, or against President Trump personally,\" says Jonathan Turley, who teaches at the George Washington University Law School.\n\nTurley, who was lead counsel in a case brought by Congress that successfully challenged part of the Affordable Care Act, knows firsthand about suing the president. Legal challenges like that one have become standard procedure in Washington.\n\nPrinceton University political history professor Julian Zelizer says that in an era of heightened partisanship, executive orders are an increasingly popular way to make policy. The Obama administration used them, and now the Trump administration is doing the same. According to Zelizer, Democrats and their allies are pushing back the only way they can: in court. Just like Republicans did.\n\n\"When a president releases an executive order, one of the instant responses is to try to tie it up legally,\" Zelizer says. \"Opponents of President Trump are looking to what the Republicans did in the last few years as a roadmap forward. Conservatives know this can be an incredibly effective tool to stop presidents from doing things that you don't want them to do.\"\n\nTrump is no stranger to litigation. He has been a defendant and a plaintiff in thousands of lawsuits as a real estate developer and reality TV star. His general legal strategy? Fight back.\n\n\"When I get sued, I take it right \u2014 just take it all the way,\" Trump said during the campaign. \"You know what happens? If you settle suits, you get sued more.\"\n\nIn November, however, the then-president-elect did settle lawsuits related to Trump University. Some of the lawsuits from Trump's business career will follow him into office. Turley of George Washington University said that, too, is novel\u2014and could be a distraction for the White House.\n\n\"Those lawsuits that are found to have merit and are based on President Trump's personal conduct are likely to be something of a nuisance,\" Turley said.\n\nThe lawsuits over Trump's executive orders could be significant obstacles to his agenda for years to come. Court hearings on the challenges over his travel ban are already underway across the country.",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Chicago Rally, Blames Protesters; Arrests Made at University of Illinois Event\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chaotic turn of events, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump canceled a rally in Chicago on Friday, blaming \"thugs\" for the decision, while supporters of his Democratic rivals, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, were accused of causing disruptions.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Saturday, stating, \"It is (Clinton) and (Sanders) people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!\"\n\nHowever, both Clinton and Sanders denied any involvement in the protests. In a statement, Sanders said, \"What caused the violence at Trump\u2019s rally is a campaign whose words and actions have encouraged it on the part of his supporters.\"\n\nThe Chicago Police Department reported that four men and a woman were arrested at the rally after brief scuffles broke out at the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion. Four of the individuals were still in police custody on Saturday morning but had not yet been charged, said Officer Jose Estrada, a department spokesman. One individual was given an ordinance citation and released.\n\nCBS News reporter Sopan Deb was also reportedly detained by law enforcement while covering the scene.\n\nActivist William Calloway was arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing. Calloway said police told him they arrested him because he failed to immediately exit the arena after the rally was canceled and guests were ordered to exit. The police department, however, said he was not among the five they had taken into custody. Calloway said that he was arrested by UIC campus police.\n\nCalloway played a prominent role in the court-ordered release of a police video of a white officer fatally shooting a black teenager, which triggered months of protests in the city. Calloway said he believes that his role in the McDonald case may have factored into police detaining him. He was released about three hours after being taken into custody.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a police department spokesman, said the Trump campaign did not consult the police department before canceling. \"The decision was made by the campaign on its own,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nTrump held a rally in the Dayton suburb of Vandalia on Saturday afternoon and planned an event in Cleveland ahead of primary voting in Ohio on Tuesday. Trump denied some media reports that a rally in Cincinnati on Sunday had been canceled.\n\nAt the Dayton rally, Trump said some of the people taunting and harassing his supporters in Chicago \"represented Bernie, our communist friend.\"\n\nChaos ensued after organizers announced at 6:30 p.m. that Trump, who never arrived at the pavilion, had scrubbed the event. Some protesters rushed the arena floor in celebration, many shouting, \"Bernie, Bernie\" and \"We stopped Trump!\"\n\nPolice ejected at least a half dozen anti-Trump demonstrators, including one man who got onto the stage and approached the podium.\n\nJoe Fritz, 20, who came to hear Trump speak, said a woman punched him outside the arena after the rally was canceled. He said the woman, who was with a girl about 10 years old, landed a glancing blow to his chin after he questioned her for yelling epithets toward police and about Trump. \"I told her, 'What kind of example are you setting?'\" Fritz said.\n\nFritz said he and his friend were then surrounded by other anti-Trump protesters who screamed at them before police pulled them out of the crowd.\n\nStill, the pushing and shoving was brief, and some protesters said security concerns were overstated.\n\n\"(Trump) felt us tonight and felt our power tonight,\" said Angelica Salazar, 30, of West Chicago, Ill. Salazar, who went to speak out against Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, said she did not feel unsafe.\n\nMatthew Ross, a Chicago activist, said suggestions from Trump that protesters presented a security risk do not hold up.\n\n\"Have you seen what his supporters have incited at their rallies?\" asked Ross, who said a Trump supporter threw water on him after it was announced that the rally was canceled. \"I think what [Trump] is doing is inciting violence.\"\n\nAfterward, Trump spoke by phone with several news networks and described many anti-Trump protesters, including those at previous rallies, as violent. \"I just don't want people hurt,\" he told MSNBC.\n\nTrump has been criticized about violent comments he and his supporters have made on the campaign trail. When attendees at an event in November kicked a Black Lives Matter activist, Trump said, \"Maybe he should have been roughed up.\"\n\nAnother supporter, John McGraw, sucker-punched a protester at a rally Wednesday in North Carolina. McGraw later told Inside Edition that \"we might have to kill him\" next time the protester shows up.\n\nTrump insisted that anti-Trump protesters were instigating incidents at his events. \u201c I certainly don\u2019t incite violence,\" he said.\n\n\u201c If a protester is swinging a fist at a man or a group of men, and if they end up going back,\" he said, \"I\u2019m not looking to do him any favors.\"\n\nTrump's rivals for the GOP nomination quickly weighed in on the uproar.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, speaking Saturday in Florida, blamed the rhetoric of the front-runner for the violence, and the media for ignoring his \"offensive\" statements for too long.\n\n\"This is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of anger and bitterness and frustration,\" Rubio said.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest rival in the race, noted that \"in any campaign, responsibility starts at the top.\"\n\n\"When the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates,\" Cruz told reporters in Illinois. \"Today is unlikely to be the last such incidence.\"\n\nFellow GOP candidate John Kasich blamed Friday's events on Trump sowing \"seeds of division.\"\n\n\"Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen,\" the Ohio governor said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the \"divisive rhetoric\" of the Trump campaign should be of \"grave concern.\"\n\n\"We all have our differences, and we know many people across the country feel angry,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"We need to address that anger together.\"",
    " Title: \"Eric Holder and the Resurgence of Polarizing Politics in the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a time where bipartisanship and unity are often called for, the focus of political discourse has been on Eric Holder, a former Attorney General, who has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. His actions and statements have sparked controversy and raised questions about the direction of the party.\n\nThe article highlights various instances where Holder has been involved in controversial matters, such as commuting the sentences of hard-left terrorists, defending a jihadist involved in a second wave of 9/11 attacks, and defying congressional committees investigating his Justice Department's actions. The article also touches upon Holder's history of political corruption, including helping a Democratic president circumvent the Justice Department in carrying out a pay-to-play pardon.\n\nThe piece also discusses the broader implications of Holder's actions, suggesting that they illustrate two significant points. First, it argues that the high-minded ideals put forth by the hard left are a dangerous fraud. The article points to the Obama administration's history of associating with radical figures and using militant tactics as evidence of this.\n\nSecond, the article suggests that the recent regression to 1970s-style politics, as seen in the confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, was not about Kavanaugh himself but about power. The article argues that the character assassination of Kavanaugh was a message to any conservative who seeks high public office, warning of the tactics Democrats are willing to use to maintain power.\n\nThe article concludes by urging Democrats who love America and strive to improve it, but not radically alter it, to take their party back. The piece suggests that the country needs these Democrats to reclaim the party and move away from the polarizing tactics and ideologies that have been associated with figures like Eric Holder.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Reach Agreement for Return of Seized Underwater Drone\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday via Twitter that China has agreed to return a U.S. drone that was seized by its navy from international waters. Military officials from both nations confirmed the deal.\n\nThe Pentagon reached an agreement with the Chinese to return the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) that a Chinese crew removed from the South China Sea on Thursday. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook stated, \"Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the [UUV] to the United States.\"\n\nChinese military leaders expressed regret over the incident but criticized American leaders for overreacting to the drone's capture. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Sr. Col. Yang Yujun stated early Saturday, \"China and the United States have been communicating about this issue. It is inappropriate and unhelpful for a resolution that the U.S. has unilaterally hyped up the issue.\"\n\nU.S. military officials did not disclose when or how the drone would be returned, but they objected to China's \"unlawful seizure\" of their equipment. Negotiations over the transfer of the drone came as President-elect Trump accused China of stealing the research device.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy (D-CT) tweeted that Trump's \"escalation of a diplomatic crisis with China\" was \"madness.\" However, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) called the incident a \"flagrant violation of the freedom of the seas\" and said the country \"must not stand for such outrageous conduct.\"\n\nA U.S. Navy oceanographic research vessel had deployed the drone about 100 miles from the U.S. Navy base at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Pentagon officials said the drone was merely measuring ocean conditions in the region. However, Chinese officials accused the U.S. of conducting \"surveillance and military surveys\" with the equipment.\n\nTensions between the global powers were already rising when the president-elect received a post-election congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's president last month. Some criticized Trump for breaking diplomatic protocol surrounding the longstanding U.S. \"one China\" policy, while others applauded Trump's boldness.\n\nSome experts speculated that China targeted the drone in response to Trump's increasingly confrontational rhetoric. Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interests, told The Hill, \"Knowing Chinese military officials for many years and how orders are communicated from the highest power centers in Beijing down to commanders on the ground or water, this was very likely a highly planned and escalatory move to show China will not take [these] matters lightly.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Rules Against Federal Intervention in Partisan Gerrymandering Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts have no jurisdiction to intervene in political partisan gerrymandering cases, a decision that underscores the ideological divide among the justices and is expected to have lasting implications.\n\nThe ruling was met with immediate outcry from Democrats and anti-gerrymandering activists, and is a significant setback for those who sought to challenge politically-drawn district maps that they believed to be unconstitutional.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's majority opinion that federal courts cannot consider partisan gerrymandering cases. Roberts argued that federal judges have no authority to reallocate political power between the two major political parties, and no legal standards to limit and direct their decisions.\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and John Roberts joined Roberts' majority opinion.\n\nJustices Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor \u2013 the court's liberal members \u2013 dissented. In a stinging dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote, \"For the first time ever, this court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities.\"\n\nThe ruling opens the door for instances of partisan gerrymandering in district maps to be upheld across the country. The justices made the ruling in a pair of cases presented over district maps in Maryland and North Carolina, alleged to be instances of unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders.\n\nDemocrats in North Carolina had challenged congressional districts drawn by Republicans, claiming that the state GOP crafted the map to favor their party. And Republicans in Maryland had claimed that the state's map was drawn in such a way that it intentionally eliminated a GOP congressional seat.\n\nThursday's ruling also means pending litigation challenging other states' congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders are all but certain to fail. The justices were weighing district maps in Ohio and Michigan that were also challenged as instances of partisan gerrymandering, but this ruling signals that the cases will also be dismissed.\n\nDemocrats quickly came out against the decision, as did voting rights groups, claiming that it sets a dangerous precedent and allows state maps to be restructured at the will of whichever political party controls the state legislature. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has focused on fighting partisan gerrymandering since leaving office, decried the ruling. \"This decision tears at the fabric of our democracy and puts the interests of the established few above the many,\" he said Thursday. \"History will not be kind in its assessment.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Imposes New Sanctions on Iran over Missile Tests and Yemen Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Friday new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Iranian government's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, do not address the Iranian nuclear deal, but rather focus on Iran's ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups.\n\nJohn E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that \"Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, to our partners worldwide, and to the United States.\"\n\nPresident Trump, when asked about Iran by reporters, responded simply, \"They're not behaving.\" The sanctions affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing any property or funds they may have under U.S. jurisdiction. The Treasury Department also stated that \"U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions\" with those on the sanctions list.\n\nTrump signaled the sanctions with an early morning tweet, stating, \"Iran is playing with fire \u2014 they don't appreciate how 'kind' President Obama was to them. Not me!\" In announcing earlier this week that the administration had put Iran \"on notice,\" Trump and his aides cited a recent ballistic missile test as well as supporting a rebel group in Yemen known as the Houthis.\n\nThe Treasury Department stated that \"this action reflects the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region.\" Iran has denied that its missile tests violate United Nations regulations and has generally mocked the president over his criticism.\n\nThe financial restrictions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement in which the United States and allies drew down sanctions on Iran as it agreed to give up the means to make nuclear weapons. While Trump has questioned whether the agreement can be verified, the Treasury Department stated that these new sanctions deal with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups.\n\nThe agreement dealt only with nuclear-related sanctions; other restrictions involving Iranian financial transactions remain. The sanctioned individuals and companies have been linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity, such as the Houthis, officials said. They have been identified through an ongoing review of Iranian activity that goes back to the Obama administration.\n\nThe Treasury Department is being led by Acting Secretary Adam J. Szubin, a holdover from the Obama administration who has been involved in sanction activity. Trump's nominee to lead the department, Steve Mnuchin, is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\n\"These kinds of sanctions do not happen quickly,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, but were triggered by an Iranian missile test and terrorist activities. Officials declined to say whether Trump plans to kill the Iranian nuclear deal\u2014or somehow force Iran to walk away from it\u2014but pledged to keep their eye on the regime.\n\nCalling Iran \"the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,\" national security adviser Michael Flynn stated that \"the international community has been too tolerant of Iran's bad behavior... The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations that threaten our interests.\"\n\nLawmakers generally applauded the sanctions, but questioned some of the administration's saber-rattling toward Iran. \"I urge the Administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran,\" said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), \"and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric\u2014or provocative tweets\u2014that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges.\"",
    " Title: Trump Signs Bill Establishing U.S. Space Force as New Military Service\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which includes the creation of the U.S. Space Force, marking the first new military service in over 70 years. The signing ceremony took place at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump emphasized the importance of American superiority in space, stating, \"Space is the world's new war-fighting domain. Among grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital.\"\n\nThe Space Force is part of a $1.4 trillion government spending package, which includes the Pentagon's budget and provides funding for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border fence, as well as reversing unpopular and unworkable automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper stated, \"Our reliance on space-based capabilities has grown dramatically, and today outer space has evolved into a warfighting domain of its own. Maintaining dominance in space will now be Space Force's mission.\"\n\nSpace Force, a topic that has been a reliable applause line at Trump's political rallies, is seen more soberly by the military as an affirmation of the need to more effectively organize for the defense of U.S. interests in space, particularly satellites used for navigation and communication. Space Force is not designed or intended to put combat troops in space.\n\nThe creation of Space Force has been a contentious issue, with many Democrats opposing it. Unlike the Navy, Army, and Air Force, Space Force will be administered by the Secretary of the Air Force. The law requires the four-star general who will lead Space Force, with the title of Chief of Space Operations, will be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but not in Space Force's first year. Trump said its leader will be Air Force Gen. John W. Raymond, the commander of U.S. Space Command.\n\nSpace Force will be the provider of forces to U.S. Space Command, a separate organization established earlier this year as the overseer of the military's space operations. The division of responsibilities and assets between Space Force and Space Command has not been fully worked out.\n\nSpace Force will be small compared to its sister services. It will initially have about 200 people and a first-year budget of $40 million. The military's largest service, the Army, has about 480,000 active-duty soldiers and a budget of about $181 billion. The Pentagon spends about $14 billion a year on space operations, most of which is in the Air Force budget.\n\nKaitlyn Johnson, a space policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees the creation of Space Force as an important move but doubts it will prove as momentous as Trump administration officials suggest. Vice President Mike Pence has touted Space Force as \"the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces.\" And Esper earlier this week called this an \"epic moment\" in recent American military history.\n\nJohnson says Democrats' opposition to making Space Force a separate branch of the military means it could be curtailed or even dissolved if a Democrat wins the White House next November. \"I think that's a legitimate concern\" for Space Force advocates, she said. \"Just because it's written into law doesn't mean it can't be unwritten,\" she said, adding, \"Because of the politics that have started to surround the Space Force, I worry that that could damage its impact before it even has time to sort itself out\" within the wider military bureaucracy.\n\nSome in Congress had been advocating for a Space Force before Trump entered the White House, but his push for legislation gave the proposal greater momentum. Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was initially cool to the idea, arguing against adding new layers of potentially expensive bureaucracy. Mattis' successor, Esper, has been supportive of Space Force. In September, he said it will \"allow us to develop a cadre of warriors who are appropriately organized, trained, and equipped to deter aggression and, if necessary, to fight and win in space.\" He added, \"The next big fight may very well start in space, and the United States military must be ready.\"",
    " Title: Romney Kicks Off \" Every Town Counts \" Bus Tour in Six Swing States\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is embarking on a five-day bus tour that will take him to six battleground states, including Michigan, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. The tour, named \"Every Town Counts,\" will span over five days, starting on Friday in New Hampshire.\n\nThe tour's itinerary includes stops in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan. These states are crucial to the November election, given their competitive nature in the electoral college.\n\nIn a statement, Romney criticized President Obama's administration, stating, \"For three and a half years, President Obama has paid little attention to the everyday concerns of the American people. President Obama has offered no hope for the future, and he has left American families to bear the burden of his failed policies.\"\n\nWhile specific city stops have not been fully disclosed, some media outlets have reported on potential locations. Romney is expected to begin the tour in Stratham, New Hampshire, where he announced his presidential bid last year, according to The Foster's Daily Democrat. He will also visit Davenport, Iowa, on Monday, as reported by the Des Moines Register, marking his third visit to Iowa since the caucuses. The Detroit News reported that Romney will conclude the tour in Michigan and attend fundraisers on June 20 in Grand Rapids and Troy.\n\nThe bus tour comes as polls indicate a competitive race in swing states, with significant ad spending from outside groups and substantial investments from both campaigns. A number of the states Romney will visit were identified by Romney pollster Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies as among the seven key states the campaign needs to win to reach the 270 electoral votes required for the presidency.\n\nA recent poll by Purple Strategies showed Romney and Obama winning two states each in the four most competitive swing states. Romney is currently leading in Ohio by three points and in Florida by four points, while Obama is ahead in Virginia by three points and in Colorado by two points.\n\nAn EPIC-MRA poll of Michigan voters released last week showed Romney leading Obama by one point, 46 percent to 45 percent. In April, Obama was ahead in that state by four points, 47 percent to 43 percent.\n\nThe Romney campaign has not yet provided specific details about the tour's schedule, but the bus tour is expected to offer Romney an opportunity to connect with voters in small towns and emphasize his campaign's focus on the economy and job creation.",
    " Title: Celebrities Urge Fans to Register to Vote Ahead of US Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of social media posts, several high-profile celebrities have been urging their followers to register to vote in the upcoming US midterm elections. Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Chance the Rapper, John Legend, and others have taken to their platforms to encourage voter registration, emphasizing the importance of political participation.\n\nRihanna, with her 65 million followers, posted a message on Instagram, urging her followers to register to vote. She wrote, \"Good Morning America. Who is awake this morning? And who's woke? You have one job today, and that is to properly register to vote.\" She accompanied the post with a picture of the voter registration deadlines in various states.\n\nTaylor Swift, who surprised many with her political stance, posted on Sunday, endorsing candidates Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the House of Representatives in her home state of Tennessee. She also encouraged her 112 million followers to register to vote, writing, \"So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count.\"\n\nSwift's post had a significant impact, with more than 166,000 people registering to vote within 24 hours of the deadline, according to officials. Swift, 28, also spoke out during the American Music Awards, urging the audience to vote.\n\nPolitics seems to be a hot topic for the Kardashian-West family, as it was confirmed earlier in the week that Kanye West would meet President Donald Trump for lunch on Thursday. Kim Kardashian-West has been vocal about using her vote in the past and has urged her Twitter followers to do the same ahead of the registration deadline.\n\nChance the Rapper is also dedicated to spreading the message about registering to vote. He teamed up with the NAACP two years ago on his US tour to encourage more black people to vote by giving out voter registration forms. This time around, he has been active on Twitter, retweeting activists from his native Chicago who have been explaining the process.\n\nJohn Legend has been active on social media to promote voter registration as well. He shared the same graphic as Rihanna, writing, \"make sure you're registered. Then vote like our future depends on it!\" Along with endorsing Democrat Stacey Abrams for Governor of Georgia, he has also been campaigning for reinstating voter rights to a number of citizens with criminal convictions in Florida.\n\nA number of other celebrities, including actors Eva Longoria and Tom Hanks and singers Janelle Monae and Panic at the Disco's Brendan Urie, have also joined the call to action. The amendment in Florida, if passed, would see 1.5 million people given the vote in the state.\n\nThe celebrities' messages emphasize the importance of political participation and the power of the vote. As the midterm elections approach, the focus on voter registration and political engagement is growing, with celebrities using their platforms to encourage their followers to make their voices heard.",
    " Title: \"The Plight of the 1.6 Billion: The Unseen Victims of the COVID-19 Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an unprecedented global economic crisis, with millions of jobs lost and billions more at risk. However, a report from the International Labor Organization (ILO) last week has shed light on a critical and often overlooked aspect of this crisis: the 1.6 billion workers on the margins of the world economy, who are in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods.\n\nThese workers, which include migrant workers, gig workers, and service industry staff, make up half the world's workforce. The ILO found that COVID-19 has left almost all of them finding it precariously hard to make ends meet.\n\nThe economic fallout from the pandemic has been felt across the globe. In the United States, over 30 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, representing over 15% of the workforce. In Western Europe, joblessness is also increasing. Only government wage-support subsidies have staved off a U.S.-scale spike, by keeping idle or furloughed workers notionally employed. In China, official statistics have reported only a slight uptick in unemployment, but this figure excludes a migrant workforce of nearly 300 million people.\n\nThe 1.6 billion figure refers to the so-called informal economy, encompassing migrant workers, agricultural workers, and shift workers in the developing world, as well as gig workers and service-industry staff increasingly predominant in wealthier economies. The ILO found that COVID-19 had left almost all of them finding it precariously hard to make ends meet.\n\nThe immediate challenge for governments involves budgeting or printing more money for multitrillion-dollar stimulus programs, like those in the U.S., or salary-support schemes favored in Europe and elsewhere. However, the sums needed for such schemes will likely grow further.\n\nThe long-term challenge, though, may prove to be even tougher. The best-case scenario envisages a fairly early exit from COVID-19, through a combination of treatment or inoculation advances and a staged reboot of the world economy. But the question remains: How many of the jobs lost to COVID-19 will be lost for good, or at least for a long time after the economic reopenings?\n\nThe service economy, including restaurants, leisure businesses, and small retail shops, and the ILO's 1.6 billion strugglers in the informal economy worldwide, are particularly at risk. Much will depend on the longer-term effects of the blow COVID-19 has dealt to the world economy, through major slowdowns in the world's two leading economies, the U.S. and China, and huge disruptions to international trade.\n\nThe human cost of long-term mass joblessness could pose major social and political challenges. Work, especially for those living payday to payday, is essential to economic survival. But it's also central to people's identity, their sense of self-definition, even self-worth. The human cost of the Great Depression, a period that, like many of great suffering, also produced great insights and works of art, is perhaps chronicled nowhere as searingly as in the pages of John Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath.\"\n\nWhile work can form a core part of a person's identity, worklessness can depress and embitter. A more recent example - the political fallout from the 2008 world financial crisis - is a reminder that one result can be a growth in the kind of anger and resentment on which populist strongmen often feed.\n\nThe good news, or so organizations like the ILO are emphasizing, is that the employment crisis caused by COVID-19 is not limited to one country or region. Their hope is that, rather than focus only on the domestic imperative of getting each national economy back on its feet, governments will take shared, international action to address the needs of the \"1.6 billion\" in a post-pandemic world.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Leaders Assure Bipartisan Approach in Russia Investigation, Distancing from House Chaos\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a marked contrast to the ongoing turmoil in the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee emphasized their commitment to a bipartisan approach during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nRepublican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee's ranking member, underscored the bipartisan nature of their investigation during the press conference.\n\nWhen asked about his past support for President Trump, including his past role as an adviser to his campaign, Sen. Burr, who described the investigation as \"one of the biggest\" Congress has seen in his 20-plus-year tenure on Capitol Hill, joked that he would \"do something I've never done.\"\n\n\"I'll admit that I voted for him,\" he said. \"But I've got a job in the United States Senate. And I take that job extremely seriously.\"\n\n\"It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties I might have,\" he continued. \"Mark and I might look at politics differently \u2014 we do not look at the responsibilities we have on the committee differently. And that's to earn the trust and respect of the intelligence community so they feel open and good about sharing information with us, because that enables us to do our oversight... that much better.\"\n\nSen. Warner added that he has \"confidence\" that the Burr-led committee will \"get to the bottom of this.\"\n\n\"And... if you get nothing else from today, take that statement to the bank,\" he said.\n\nAs Sen. Burr and Sen. Warner answered questions about their committee's investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes continued his defense of meeting on the White House grounds with a source to get information pertaining to potential surveillance of President Trump and his team.\n\nThe investigation in the House has been marred by partisanship, with Nunes and committee Democrats disputing assertions regarding their investigation's process. Prominent Democrats, and now even a Republican congressman, have called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation, which he has insisted he would not do.\n\nFor the two senators, Wednesday's press conference could not have stood in starker contrast to the investigation taking place in the House.\n\n\"We will get to the bottom of this,\" Warner said. \"Richard and I have known each other a long time. And the chairman and I have serious concern about what the Russians have done and continue to do around the world.\"\n\n\"The mission of the Senate committee is to look at all activities that Russia might have taken to alter or influence the 2016 elections in the United States,\" Burr continued. \"In addition to that, the mission of the committee is to look at any contacts [either campaign had] with Russian government, Russian government officials, that might have influenced in any way shape or form the election process.\"\n\n\"We take that very seriously,\" he added. \"It's not something that can be done quickly.\"\n\nSen. Burr promised his committee would look \"anywhere intelligence suggest there might have been any type of relationship or effort to influence US elections.\"\n\nAsked about whether he could definitively rule out any collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials, Burr said it was \"crazy to try to draw conclusions\" at this stage of the investigation, adding that it is unwise to share updates on a \"minute-by-minute\" basis because those bits and pieces are \"not always accurate\" once further intelligence is uncovered.\n\nThe House investigation, for the past week, has seemingly been operating in a way where such \"minute-by-minute\" revelations are being made, starting with Nunes' first briefing with reporters last week. Burr said his committee would not be asking the House to play \"any role in our investigation\" and \"we do not plan to play any role in their investigation.\"\n\nSen. Warner insisted that a bipartisan approach is a must for an investigation that has, in many respects, become infected with partisanship elsewhere.\n\n\"If we do not come to some joint conclusion... I think we will not have fulfilled our duty,\" he said, later adding, \"We're going to get it right.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Defense of Russia's Actions in Helsinki Summit Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a news conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018, President Donald Trump's comments regarding the United States and Russia's shared responsibility for the strained relations between the two countries have sparked controversy.\n\nTrump's defense of Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and his statements blaming both the United States and Russia for poor relations have been met with criticism from both political sides. The left-wing publication, The Nation magazine, has criticized Trump for sounding like a Moscow correspondent, extending sympathetic understanding to Russia and blaming the United States for its adversaries' actions.\n\nTrump's comments in Helsinki were particularly concerning, as he stood next to the foreign perpetrator of the crime he was discussing. More startling were Trump's statements blaming both countries for poor relations, stating, \"I hold both countries responsible.\"\n\nThe argument that the West has provoked Russia by pushing NATO up to its borders has been rebutted by experts, such as James Kirchick of the Brookings Institution. James Baker assured Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand \"one inch eastward,\" but this was spoken when East Germany still existed, and there was never any formal agreement that NATO wouldn't expand.\n\nTrump's comments in Helsinki have been criticized for not denouncing and distinguishing the United States' behavior from Russia's. Putin, on the other hand, has always been in control and never said anything to undercut his own country. In this sense, if no other, Trump should take notes from the man he refuses to criticize.",
    " Title: US Job Market Rebounds in March, but Signs Point to Gradual Economic Slowdown\n\nThe US economy added 196,000 jobs in March, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, marking a rebound after an unusually weak job market in February. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8%, near historic lows.\n\nWhile March hiring was robust, it brings the first-quarter average to 180,000 jobs created per month, down from 223,000 per month on average in 2018. Economists have been expecting a slowdown, and the latest report suggests a gradual slowdown in trend employment growth, another sign that the economy may be weakening.\n\nThe report did have one disappointing number, though: wages, which economists had expected to grow at 3.4% over the year, instead came in at 3.2%. Sustained periods of low unemployment are supposed to fuel fatter paychecks as employers struggle to fill positions, but this average hourly earnings number suggests the tight labor market is not accelerating that effect.\n\nAnother anemic month of job growth may have prompted the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut later this year, after years of trying to raise rates back to a \"neutral\" level. The report is unlikely to push them in that direction.\n\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans dropped back to 6.7%, after rising to 7% from its lowest point ever back in May 2018. However, manufacturing hiring slowed again after having been on a tear for the last year and a half. The sector lost 6,000 jobs in March, concentrated largely in the auto and auto parts sector. Retail also dropped another 12,000 jobs in March.\n\nAccording to the household survey, the unemployment rate only remained steady because the labor force shrank slightly more than the number of jobs. If this trend continues, it may show that those who remain on the sidelines of the labor market have structural barriers to joining it, such as care responsibilities or transportation challenges.\n\nAnother sign that hiring is cooling off is the median number of weeks that people remain unemployed, at 9.6 weeks, has been ticking up in recent months, suggesting that people are not finding jobs as quickly as they used to after a layoff.",
    " Title: Senate Democrat Questions Cost-Effectiveness and Conflict of Interest in Vice President Pence's Ireland Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the ranking member of the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence, requesting information regarding the costs of Pence's stay at Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg, Ireland, and comparing the costs to hotels in Dublin and other locations in the U.S.\n\nIn the letter, obtained by various media outlets, Peters expressed concern over the apparent conflict of interest in Pence's decision to stay at a property owned by President Donald Trump, potentially using taxpayer funds to profit the President.\n\nPeters wrote, \"I find it hard to believe that your office was unable to identify lodgings that could accommodate the security and logistical needs of your trip in the capital of Ireland.\"\n\nPence, who was accompanied by his family during the official trip, defended his visit to his family's Irish hometown and staying at President Donald Trump's property there at taxpayer expense, arguing that the resort was a \"logical\" choice that allowed him to highlight Irish-American ties.\n\nThe vice president held official meetings with Irish leaders in Dublin but flew back and forth across the country to spend nights in the small village of Doonbeg, where his cousin runs a bar and his great-grandmother grew up.\n\nPeters also requested information on Pence's relatives' expenditures and his reimbursements.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, requesting more information about the trip, which she called \"another example of what appears to be open corruption\" in the Trump administration.\n\nWarren asked Pompeo to provide information about Pence's Doonbeg visit and the State Department's approval of the plans. House Democrats are also planning to investigate the matter as part of their probe into violations of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits American office-holders from personally profiting from foreign governments.\n\nAttorney General William Barr is hosting a holiday party at the Trump Hotel in December, but a Justice Department official told various media outlets that he is paying for the $30,000 holiday party himself, and the purpose of the party is not to curry favor with the president.\n\nWhen asked if the president asked Pence to stay at his property, Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, said Tuesday that it was not a \"request, like a command\" but rather \"a suggestion.\"\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, the vice president's office issued a statement saying that the decision to stay at the resort was solely a decision by the Office of the Vice President and was based on the requirement to find accommodations near the Vice President\u2019s ancestral hometown that could satisfy official meetings on both coasts of the Emerald Isle.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he had \"no involvement\" in Pence's decision to stay at his resort. \"From what I understood, he was going there,\" Trump said. \"Then I heard he was going there, but I didn't -- it wasn't my idea for Mike to go there. Mike went there because his family is there. That's my -- that's my understanding of it.\"\n\nThe president also denied ever speaking to Barr about using his hotel in Washington. \"With Mike Pence, we never spoke about it, and with Bill, I never spoke about -- Attorney General Barr, we never spoke about it,\" Trump said. \"But, that's what they choose.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Deal Faces Tough Sell in Senate Amidst Political Angst\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the usual partisan gridlock that has come to characterize Washington, a bipartisan two-year budget deal crafted by the heads of the House and Senate Budget Committees, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), may face a challenging path in the Senate. The agreement, which aims to end the cycle of short-term spending bills and sequestration, is expected to undergo a procedural vote on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, predicted that Democrats will need \"about eight\" Republicans to vote in favor of the deal. This is because Democrats control 55 votes in the Senate, including two independents who usually vote with them. Durbin's prediction suggests that a few Democratic senators may vote against the deal, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) requiring 60 yes votes to overcome the procedural hurdle.\n\nThe political landscape in the Senate, traditionally less averse to compromise, may present a significant challenge for the budget deal. Many Republicans have come out against the deal, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is up for reelection in 2014. Additionally, potential presidential candidates such as Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have also expressed opposition.\n\nHowever, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is one of the few Republican senators who has publicly stated his support for the deal. McCain, who appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" cited the agreement's undoing of some of the budget cuts for defense spending mandated by the sequester as his reason for support.\n\nWhile many Republicans have expressed reservations, a handful of senators, including Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), have said they will vote to end debate on the bill and move to a final vote, but are undecided on their final position.\n\nOutside conservative groups have been vocal in their opposition to the deal, but were unable to derail its passage in the House, where it received a solid bipartisan majority that included more than half of the Republican conference. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) publicly criticized these groups last week, stating they had \"lost all credibility\" and were using Republican lawmakers and the American people.\n\nHouse GOP leaders voiced their support for the deal before the House vote, and are reportedly reaching out to some of their Senate colleagues to persuade them to support the deal. If the deal passes both chambers, it will mark a significant step for Congress, which has spent years budgeting by emergency legislation rather than normal order.\n\nFor her part, Sen. Murray stated that both parties will need to learn to trust each other enough to compromise. This, she believes, is the only way for Democrats and Republicans to have any hope of striking future budget deals or confronting tough fights ahead, such as the impending debate over raising the nation's debt limit. The deal, however, seems to have provided some hope that bipartisan cooperation is possible. Ryan stated that the House Ways and Means Committee was planning to advance tax reform legislation in the first quarter of next year, a long-elusive prospect in Washington.",
    " Title: FDA's Lackadaisical Regulation of Dietary Supplements Containing BMPEA Raises Concerns Over Industry Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) slow regulation of dietary supplements containing the potentially dangerous stimulant BMPEA, as reported in The Times, highlights a classic instance of industry influence on the agency responsible for regulating them. The concerning ingredient, BMPEA, is a chemical that is chemically similar to amphetamine and is added to weight-loss and workout supplements to enhance their effects. However, the effectiveness and safety of BMPEA in humans have not been tested due to the lack of such tests.\n\nAs reported in The Times, the FDA was the first to suspect that BMPEA had been improperly added to supplements that listed the little-known plant, acacia rigidula, among their ingredients. Experts suggest that such listings are often indicative of a manufacturer trying to disguise a chemical additive as a natural botanical extract. The FDA tested 21 popular supplements that listed acacia rigidula on their labels and found that nine of them contained BMPEA.\n\nDespite these findings, the FDA did not recall the products, issue a health alert, or name them. In contrast, Canadian health authorities deemed the chemical a \"serious health risk\" in December, issued a public health alert, and forced a recall of JetFuel Superburn, which they found to contain BMPEA and another amphetamine-like stimulant.\n\nA significant portion of the FDA's slow response can be attributed to Dr. Daniel Fabricant, who left a senior position at the Natural Products Association, a trade group for supplement manufacturers and sellers, to head the FDA's division of dietary supplement programs in early 2011. He returned to the trade association as its chief executive in the spring of 2014. Dr. Fabricant has been succeeded by several acting directors, with Cara Welch, also from the same trade group, currently holding the position. Both Dr. Fabricant and Ms. Welch have been criticized for their slow response to the BMPEA issue.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Offers Temporary Exemption for Individuals Losing Health Plans Due to Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of Democratic senators have received assurance from the Obama administration that individuals who have lost their existing health plans due to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will be eligible for a temporary hardship exemption, allowing them to purchase catastrophic health plans.\n\nIn a letter to six senators, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated, \"I agree with you that these consumers should qualify for this temporary hardship exemption, and I can assure you that the exemption will be available to them.\" The details of how the exemption will function are yet to be clarified.\n\nThe senators' concerns addressed fears that people who lost coverage due to Obamacare would be left uninsured if they did not find an alternative on state-based markets by Monday, the deadline to have coverage by the new year. The cancellation of many policies was due to Obamacare's requirements that all health plans provide a range of services.\n\nThe initial concerns were raised by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Each of the senators represents a state served by HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange system that experienced widespread web glitches upon its Oct. 1 debut.\n\nThe Obama administration has stated that the website is functioning much better as of the start of this month. The senators responded, \"We are pleased that the Administration appears to have responded to the concerns we've raised. As a result, this clarifies an option that will help those consumers who have had their plans cancelled this year transition more smoothly into the marketplace.\" They added, \"We will closely monitor how the Administration implements this option, and we remain committed to proposing responsible solutions.\"",
    " Title: The Rise of Intersectionality and the Perceived Loss of Ingroup Status: A Study on White Nationalism and Psychological Well-being\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study published in the Political Psychology journal has shed light on the growing \"white backlash\" or \"whitelash\" in white-majority countries, and the underlying psychological reasons for the rise of nationalistic views. The study, which surveyed over 15,000 New Zealand registered voters, found that perceptions of group-based deprivation were associated with increased feelings of nationalism, and that nationalistic beliefs increased the psychological well-being of those who felt that they were being deprived.\n\nThe study's results seem intuitive: If a particular group (of any skin color) is constantly being lectured that they are less worthy than others, and also that complaining about such lectures is itself a symptom of privilege and racism, what other outcome might we realistically expect?\n\nThe term \"intersectionality\" does not appear in the paper, but the study's findings align with the theory of intersectionality, which maintains that non-whites, women, and LGBT individuals face systemic oppression whose scope increases according to the number of minority statuses a person holds. The fewer boxes one checks (straight white men don't check any), the more \"privilege\" one is deemed to possess. This privilege, which now serves as a sort of intersectional mark of Cain, is invoked to justify reverse racism.\n\nThe study's authors write, \"What our model shows, for the first time, is that it is possible for a group to feel unfairly treated within a larger political entity (in this case, the nation) and simultaneously identify strongly with that entity.\" They suggest that nationalism buffers well-being against the negative psychological consequences of perceiving one's group to be deprived.\n\nThe rise of nationalism in white-majority countries might be, in part, a reaction to a perceived loss of ingroup status, the study implies. This perceived loss of status is driven, in part, by the theory of intersectionality and similar doctrines that openly devalue white people by presenting their accomplishments as the product of bigotry instead of hard work or talent.\n\nThe study's findings challenge the notion that ending discrimination against minorities requires promoting intolerance against the majority. Defending individuals of the majority group from unequal treatment is not tantamount to \"complicity\" in the oppression of others.\n\nThe study's results also highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of race and privilege. It is crucial to recognize that not all individuals who are categorized under labels such as \"white nationalist\" or \"alt-right\" hold extremist views. Some may be motivated by a desire to support a group (their own) that they believe has been demoted to the bottom of society's status totem pole. To the extent that these nationalistic activists argue there should be no totem pole whatsoever, they are at least nominally basing their appeal in the liberal notion of individual equality.\n\nThe study's findings also underscore the importance of fostering open and constructive dialogue rather than resorting to name-calling and shaming. Denouncing individuals as Nazis or white supremacists without understanding their motivations and experiences only serves to alienate potential allies who oppose racism and reverse racism alike.\n\nDebra W.

    " Title: Obama and Romney Differ in Approach to Disaster Relief as Sandy Recovery Efforts Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have offered differing perspectives on the role of the federal government in disaster relief efforts.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama expressed his sympathies for those affected by the storm and pledged the full support of the federal government. \"The most important message I have for them is that America's with you,\" he said. \"We are standing behind you, and we are going to do everything we can to help you get back on your feet.\"\n\nIn contrast, Mitt Romney, during a canned food drive for storm victims in Ohio, emphasized the importance of individual action and local initiatives. \"If everybody cleans their lane, we'll be able to get the job done,\" he said. \"And so today we're cleaning one lane. We're able to gather some goods for some people that are in our lane. We're going to help them.\"\n\nWhile Romney did not suggest that voluntary efforts alone could replace government aid, he has previously argued for a more decentralized approach to disaster relief. During a Republican primary debate last year, he stated, \"Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction.\"\n\nThe federal government's response to Hurricane Sandy has been praised by some state officials, including Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, who commended the administration and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate for their efforts. However, the relationship between state disaster officials and the federal government has not always been smooth, and the federal government's role in disaster relief remains a contentious issue, particularly among Republicans who advocate for reduced federal spending.\n\nPresident Obama has promised to keep red tape to a minimum in the recovery process and has made a point of being accessible to state and local officials. \"I told the mayors and the governors if they're getting 'no' for an answer somewhere in the federal government, they can call me personally at the White House,\" the president said.\n\nAs the recovery efforts continue, the debate over the role of the federal government in disaster relief will likely persist, with both candidates emphasizing their respective approaches to addressing the needs of those affected by natural disasters. President Obama will tour hard-hit New Jersey on Wednesday, while Mitt Romney has yet to comment further on the issue.",
    " Title: Rubio Vows to Block Spending Bill Unless Obamacare is Defunded\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio has declared that he will not support a short-term spending bill to maintain government operations unless it includes the defunding of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The senator made this statement during a breakfast event hosted by The Weekly Standard and Concerned Veterans for America on Thursday.\n\nRubio, a Republican from Florida, urged his fellow senators to follow suit, stating, \"I will not vote for a continuing resolution unless that continuing resolution defunds Obamacare.\" He predicted that the debate over the ACA will coincide with the start of enrollment in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges in October.\n\nIn his speech, Rubio criticized the ACA as \"un-implementable,\" citing potential issues such as delays in the readiness of insurance exchanges and the government's inability to verify individuals' income to ensure they are not receiving excessive insurance subsidies.\n\nRubio anticipates a critical moment when members of Congress realize they will lose their federal health insurance plans and be forced to enroll in the federal exchanges in January, a requirement in the law that has not been fully addressed.\n\n\"I'll tell you when it's going to come to a head is when members of Congress realize that they, too, will lose their health insurance, and they, too, will be thrown into a federal exchange,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio positioned the ACA as a significant example of the deep philosophical differences between the two major political parties, also highlighting disagreements over budget, environmental, and gun control issues. The senator did not mention immigration, a topic currently under discussion in the House, where he was a key player in the bipartisan Senate bill.",
    " Title: White House Faces Urgent Concerns Over ObamaCare Website's Functionality and Financial Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the public assurances of the Obama administration regarding the smooth functioning of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, internal documents have revealed that the administration privately fears a critical flaw in the system could potentially bankrupt insurance companies and jeopardize the entire health care reform program.\n\nJohn Goodman, of the National Center for Policy Analysis, stated, \"Week after week, month after month, the Obama administration kept telling us everything's working fine, there's no problem, and then they turn on a dime and fire their contractor.\" The administration's decision to terminate CGI as the lead contractor and award a no-bid contract to Accenture was followed by the release of documents from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These documents offered a rare insight into the administration's worst fears, stating that the problems with the website could put \"the entire health insurance industry at risk,\" potentially leading to their default and disrupting services and coverage for consumers.\n\nThe documents further warned that if the problems were not fixed by mid-March, they would result in financial harm to the government. The administration went as far as to say that without the necessary fixes, \"the entire health care reform program is jeopardized.\"\n\nDespite the \"urgent\" need officials cited to prevent the system from collapsing, White House spokesman Jay Carney claimed ignorance of the statements. \"I didn't see the article. I'm not aware of those statements,\" Carney said.\n\nThe dangers were known in early December, but later, shortly before CGI was fired, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius gave a positive account of the situation. \"I\u2019m thrilled that we\u2019re going to have millions of people for the first time that have health security,\" she said.\n\nShortly after the website went live, it was revealed that a critical part of the system, known as the \"back end,\" had not even been built yet. Doug Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, explained, \"The back end -- that information is supposed to be transmitted to an insurance company, the insurance company knows who you are, they know what policy you've picked.\"\n\nHowever, the back end is still not built, causing massive confusion for insurance companies due to missing information on who has signed up and what subsidies they are entitled to. Sebelius insisted once again on Wednesday that everything would come together, and insurance companies would receive their payments. \"I mean we will get them paid,\" she said. \"There is no question about that, so we are on track.\"\n\nFor now, officials concede they're relying on estimates from the insurers. \"Here's who we think we have, and here's the subsidy we think they're owed,\" explains Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Please send us a check from the treasury,\" he says, chuckling. \"The honor system again.\"\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin further noted, \"And on top of that, you can't match policies, people, to the federal subsidies, and that's a big problem in terms of just the mechanics of making payments.\"\n\nThe administration emphasizes that fixing the site by mid-March is urgent to prevent the system from descending into chaos and threatening the future of ObamaCare. Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac poll gives the president poor grades for his management of health care, with 59 percent disapproving while 36 percent approve.",
    " Title: CMS Proposes Changes to Obamacare's Risk Adjustment System in Bid to Bolster Exchanges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the struggles faced by health insurance companies participating in the Obamacare exchanges, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has released new proposed rules for the Affordable Care Act. The 294-page rule, known as the Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018, includes changes to the law's risk adjustment system, a mechanism designed to distribute risk among participating insurers.\n\nThe proposed changes aim to factor in data about prescription drug usage and account for beneficiaries who only enroll for part of the year. The goal is to mitigate the high cost of very sick individuals who rely on expensive drugs and people who are gaming the system by paying for insurance only when they need it.\n\nWhile the specifics of the rules, particularly the prescription drug changes, have raised concerns among experts, who worry about potential increases in overall healthcare spending due to unnecessary prescriptions, the broader picture is one of acknowledgment by the federal government of the problems with the exchanges.\n\nInsurers have been dropping out of Obamacare's exchanges, dramatically raising premiums, and suggesting they might pull out of even more of the health law marketplaces if their premium hikes are blocked. The new rules are CMS's way of signaling to insurers that they have heard their complaints and are trying to respond.\n\nThe timing of the release of the rules is significant, with CMS taking the unusual step of releasing the proposal now, presumably in an attempt to calm insurers amid significant moves by carriers like Aetna to scale back their exchange business.\n\nWhile the new rules may quell some of the grumbling from insurers, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the fundamental issues facing Obamacare's exchanges. The problem is not the specific rules by which the exchanges operate; it's the health mix and number of customers inside the exchanges. The new rules are best viewed as small tweaks designed to reassure insurers that the federal government still cares about their business, but the challenges facing Obamacare are too large to be solved by such adjustments.",
    " Title: President Obama Discusses Terrorism, NSA, and Sochi Olympics on 'The Tonight Show'\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a light-hearted yet serious interview on 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno' Tuesday night, President Barack Obama addressed a range of topics, including terrorism, the NSA, and the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nThe President acknowledged the recent temporary closure of U.S. embassies in the Middle East and Africa as a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism. He stated, \"This radical, violent extremism is still out there, and we've got to stay on top of it.\"\n\nRegarding the embassy closures, Obama advised, \"If people are paying attention, checking with the State Department or embassy, going on the website before you travel, finding out what kind of precautions you should be taking, then I think it still makes sense for people to take vacations.\"\n\nOn the issue of domestic spying, Obama clarified, \"We do not have a domestic spying program. What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track a phone number or an email address that we know is connected to some sort of terrorist threat. And that information is useful.\"\n\nThe President also addressed the George Zimmerman trial, stating, \"We do not know yet exactly what he did, other than what he's said on the Internet, and it's important for me not to prejudge something.\"\n\nRussia's threat to enforce anti-gay laws at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was another topic of discussion. Obama expressed confidence that Russia would ensure the Olympics run smoothly, stating, \"I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we would not tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently.\"\n\nThe interview also touched on political differences with Senator John McCain, with Obama praising McCain's integrity. The President also shared personal moments, such as his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case and the \"post-administration glow\" his wife, Michelle, exhibited after leaving the White House.\n\nOverall, the interview provided a glimpse into the President's thoughts on a variety of pressing issues, offering insight into his perspective on terrorism, the NSA, and the upcoming Olympics in Sochi.",
    " Title: Media's Dilemma: Balancing Objectivity and Normalization in Covering President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, President Donald Trump's rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday evening was marked by an unusual and disjointed speech, where the president spoke about lightbulbs, toilets, war crimes, and joked about a former president being in hell, among other topics. This event, in many ways, presents a challenge for the media, as capturing the president's unconventional behavior can be perceived as an attempt to make him look foolish or anti-Trump.\n\nHowever, for media outlets that strive for neutrality, the pursuit of a sober, balanced portrayal of presidential speeches often results in normalizing actions that are far from normal. A case in point is a brief report about Trump's Milwaukee speech that aired Wednesday morning on NPR. The report, originating from member station WUWM Milwaukee Public Radio, framed Trump's speech as a typical political address that \"ranged widely,\" and characterized his delivery as one in which he \"snapped back at Democrats for bringing impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nDon Moynihan, a public affairs professor at Georgetown University, noted on Twitter that NPR's report about the rally \"mentioned specific topics like Iran and impeachment but carefully omitted the insane stuff. This is one way the media strives to present Trump as a normal president.\"\n\nThe struggle to cover Trump is not unique to NPR. In a previous rally in Wisconsin last April, outlets such as CBS, USA Today, the Associated Press, and the Hill failed to mention in their reporting that Trump pushed dozens of lies and incendiary smears during his speech.\n\nThe irony lies in the fact that Trump is one of the media's foremost targets of abuse, yet the very outlets he demeans regularly bend over backward to cover him in the most favorable possible light. This disconnect between the real Trump and the whitewashed version that emerges from mainstream reporting was captured nicely by Lenore Taylor, editor of The Guardian Australia, in a piece she wrote last September titled, \"As a foreign reporter visiting the US I was stunned by Trump's press conference.\"\n\nTaylor wrote, \"I've read so many stories about his bluster and boasting and ill-founded attacks, I've listened to speeches and hours of analysis, and yet I was still taken back by just how disjointed and meandering the unedited president could sound.\"\n\nThe media's role is to provide fair and balanced coverage, but it is crucial to acknowledge the stark contrast between the unfiltered Trump and the sanitized version that often emerges in mainstream media reporting.

    " Title: California Imposes Statewide Stay-at-Home Order to Combat Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, California Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered all of the state's nearly 40 million residents to stay at home, except for essential activities, until further notice. The order, which was announced late Thursday, follows similar measures implemented in Los Angeles County and the Bay Area earlier this week.\n\nThe state's confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, stand at 675 with 16 deaths as of Wednesday evening. This places California behind Washington state and New York, where over 5,000 cases have been confirmed.\n\nThe statewide order, which takes effect immediately, is indefinite, with Governor Newsom stating that officials \"could not give a deadline that we really could believe in.\" The Los Angeles order, which will remain in effect until at least April 19, requires all businesses, including museums, malls, retail stores, and workplaces, to stop operations. Residents are only allowed to leave their homes for essential activities such as picking up food, going to the doctor, or taking a walk in the neighborhood. Businesses will have an additional day to prepare to close.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, during a press briefing, acknowledged the significant impact the new measures will have on the city. \"We \u2019 ve already radically changed how we live in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"We need to be painfully honest tonight that we're about to enter into a new way of living here.\"\n\nThe journalists at \u2588\u2588\u2588 are committed to providing trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus.

    " Title: Former U.S. National Security Officials Reject Trump's National Emergency Declaration, Citing Lack of Factual Basis\n\nAn 11-page letter signed by nearly 60 former senior U.S. national security officials has rejected President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to fund the construction of his long-promised border wall. The officials, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and John Kerry, former Republican Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and others, argue that there is no documented emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn the letter, first reported by the Washington Post, the ex-officials stated that diverting funds to the project will \"undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\" The move comes after Congress rejected Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in construction money, prompting the President to redirect federal funds intended for other purposes.\n\nThe declaration already faces numerous challenges, including multiple lawsuits, and Democrats have launched a resolution to stop Trump's border emergency. On Tuesday, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the measure aimed at stopping it. The resolution's fate in the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, is less clear, though some Republicans have expressed concern about his declaration.\n\nIn a separate letter on Monday, 23 former Republican U.S. lawmakers also urged current members of Congress to pass the resolution, according to Politico. If it passes, Trump has said he would veto it, and Congress would need to muster two-thirds of lawmakers to override a veto.\n\nThe former security officials cited U.S. government statistics showing illegal border crossings at nearly 40-year lows. They also pointed to other government data on drug trafficking, stating that most opioids enter the country via legal entry points, something they argued a border wall would not stop.\n\n\"There is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars in funding to construct a wall at the southern border,\" they wrote.\n\nWhile the letter included both Republicans and Democrats, as well as career civil servants who served under presidents of both parties, the bulk of its most senior signatories rose to their top positions under Democratic presidents. Among these former officials were CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, CIA Director John Brennan, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Deputy CIA Director David Cohen, all of whom held those posts under Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, the list also included lower-level former officials such as John Bellinger, a former State Department legal adviser, and Eliot Cohen, a former State Department counselor, both of whom served under Republican President George W. Bush.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Request Criminal Investigation into Ex-MI6 Officer over Alleged False Statements in Trump-Russia Dossier\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo senior U.S. senators, Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, have called for a criminal investigation into former MI6 officer Christopher Steele over his handling of a dossier detailing President Trump's alleged Russian links. The senate judiciary committee found that Steele had shared details from the dossier with \"multiple U.S. news outlets,\" which could potentially indicate false statements made during FBI interviews.\n\nThe dossier, which was initially compiled in 2016, claimed that Mr. Trump had colluded with Russian officials during his election campaign and alleged that Kremlin spies filmed the President in compromising positions at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2013. These allegations, which have been denied by both Moscow and Mr. Trump, are currently under investigation by several official bodies, including a probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn a joint statement, Senators Grassley and Graham stated that they were not alleging any criminal activity by Steele, but were passing on the information for \"further investigation only.\" They emphasized that the decision to refer the case for criminal investigation was not taken lightly, and they hoped the U.S. Department of Justice would carefully review their letter and take appropriate action.\n\nThe Steele dossier, which became public in January 2017, was initially funded by Republicans aiming to block Mr. Trump from becoming the party's presidential candidate. However, Democrats took over funding the investigation after Mr. Trump was nominated. Steele, who founded and runs Orbis Business Intelligence in London, is said to have shared his findings with both U.S. and UK intelligence prior to the 2016 presidential election. He briefly went into hiding after being revealed as the dossier's author, but subsequently returned to work. The UK law firm representing Steele declined to comment.",
    " Title: Obama and Holder Call for Reform of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing for Nonviolent Drug Offenders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift towards criminal justice reform, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. have called for an end to mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders. The announcement made on Monday signifies a potential turning point in addressing one of the most contentious federal policies of our time.\n\nMr. Holder described the current system as \"broken,\" and his assessment is accurate. Congress is now urged to consider and pass bipartisan legislation, introduced by President Obama and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, to provide flexibility for federal judges in sentencing nonviolent offenders.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with nearly half of these inmates serving time for drug-related crimes. Many of these individuals find themselves incarcerated due to a misguided focus on harsh punishment that does little to enhance public safety. As Mr. Holder noted, incarceration rates have grown \"at an astonishing rate \u2014 by almost 800 percent\" since 1980.\n\nThe implementation of federal mandatory minimum laws during the 1970s, '80s, and '90s has forced judges to deliver sentences far lengthier than they would have if allowed to use their own discretion. The result has been decades of damage, particularly to young people.\n\nWe have all made mistakes in our youth, but we should not ruin people's entire lives for making youthful mistakes. By today's legal standards, the past two presidents could have been imprisoned for decades as punishment for alleged indiscretions in their youth.\n\nOne example of the unjust application of mandatory minimum sentencing is the case of a 19-year-old who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy for being in a car where drugs were found. This young man, who was on course to be the first person in his family to go to college, was instead sent to prison as he turned and screamed for his mother.\n\nMandatory minimum sentencing has disproportionately affected blacks, Hispanics, and others who often lack the financial means to fight back. In many of these cases, federal laws make it impossible for well-meaning judges, law enforcement, and families to do anything to reverse these unjust sentences.\n\nOne such victim of these laws is Timothy Tyler, who was sentenced to life in prison for selling LSD to a police informant in 1994. While Tyler should have been punished for selling drugs, he should not have to spend the rest of his life in prison for it. Today, Timothy is 45 and will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, not because a judge thought it was a proper punishment, but because an arbitrary federal law demanded it.\n\nThe president and founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Julie Stewart, stated, \"He was a kid. He was following the Grateful Dead. I'm not condoning it, but it was a pretty harmless lifestyle Timothy was leading.\" Ms. Stewart added, \"It always seemed really absurd to me that for this nonviolent guy who was 24 years old, the government could write off his life. Bingo. You're gone.\"\n\nNonviolent offenders do not always return to society as normal and productive citizens after serving hard time alongside rapists and murderers. Those who are released after decades of imprisonment often have trouble finding employment and suffer from a host of other problems related to their history.\n\nThis is not proper justice\u2014and it must end. President Obama and Attorney General Holder's call for reform is a step in the right direction. The Justice Safety Valve Act (S. 619), introduced by President Obama and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, aims to restore justice by preserving judicial discretion in federal cases.\n\nIt is now our responsibility to work together to protect the next generation from this madness. Bipartisan cooperation is essential to change these laws and end the damage that mandatory minimum sentencing has inflicted on countless Americans.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: Caravan, Kavanaugh Hearings, and Warren DNA Test: A Look at the Unintended Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the political landscape in the United States is marked by a series of events that have dominated headlines and sparked heated debates. From the ongoing migrant caravan from Central America to the contentious confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test results, these events have raised questions about the role of race, gender, and immigration in the political discourse.\n\nThe caravan of over 5,000 migrants, primarily from Honduras, has been making its way through Mexico, with plans to cross the U.S. border illegally and seek asylum. The timing of the caravan's arrival, just before the midterms, has raised suspicions that it is an attempt to create empathy and sway voters towards progressive candidates advocating for a more relaxed immigration policy.\n\nThe organized nature of the caravan, the apparent resources of the migrants, and the lack of immediate danger in their homeland have led many Americans to question the presumptuousness of the would-be refugees. The concept of a border, citizenship, sovereignty, and even a country itself, seem to be at stake, as many Americans view the caravan as a threat to the very fabric of the nation.\n\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, marked by dramatic protests and disruptions, have also raised questions about due process and Western jurisprudence. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh were met with a lack of corroborating evidence, and many Americans concluded that there was no reason to deny Kavanaugh's nomination. The chaotic demonstrations that followed the confirmation have further soured public opinion.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test results, intended to prove her Native American heritage, instead confirmed that she is likely less than 1% Native American and is not from a tribe in the continental U.S. The test has been criticized as a cynical attempt to game the system for careerist advantage.\n\nIn the midst of these events, the economy, unemployment rate, and energy production, which are typically key issues in midterm elections, have taken a backseat. Instead, the focus has shifted to race, gender, and immigration, with some progressives hoping that these issues will sway moderate voters.\n\nHowever, the caravan, the Kavanaugh hearings, and the Warren DNA test have had the opposite effect on many Americans. The ongoing chaos, the lack of corroborating evidence, and the perceived attempts to game the system have reminded voters of the importance of a border, due process, and the rule of law. The midterms are expected to be a referendum on the Trump administration, but these events may serve as a reminder of the very opposite of what was intended.",
    " Title: \"Trump's Presidential Campaign Struggles: A Look at the 2016 Election and the Challenges Faced by the Republican Nominee\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, there are often unique terms that may be unfamiliar to the uninitiated. One such term, often used in campaign circles, is \"Loser,\" referring to a candidate who spends a significant amount of time criticizing the media. This term was famously applied to Bob Dole during his presidential campaign, marking a turning point in his bid for the presidency.\n\nFast forward to the 2016 presidential election, and it appears that Donald Trump is on a similar path, facing an uphill battle against Hillary Rodham Clinton. While he may have a strong following in certain circles, his approach and rhetoric seem to be falling flat in the broader electorate.\n\nRecent events have highlighted this disconnect, such as Trump's controversial claim that President Obama is the founder of the Islamic State. In an attempt to clarify his statement, talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt explained, \"You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\" However, Trump insisted on his original interpretation, stating, \"I do.\"\n\nThis incident, among others, has led many to question Trump's fitness for the presidency. His comments have been met with criticism, and he has been labeled as unconventional, even bizarre, by some. This is particularly evident in the ratings of his nightly Trump-fest on Fox News, which trails behind the ratings for the popular sitcom, The Middle.\n\nTrump's approach to campaigning seems to be a departure from the advice of Benjamin Disraeli, who once said, \"Never complain, never explain.\" However, Trump's tendency to complain and explain has been a consistent aspect of his campaign, leading some to question his ability to connect with a broader audience.\n\nAs the election approaches, it remains to be seen how Trump will fare. His campaign has been criticized for its lack of ground game, with minimal staff and field offices in key states. This has led to concerns about his ability to organize the basics of a presidential campaign, and some predict that he may lose states like Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and Colorado.\n\nIn the end, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election will likely hinge on the ability of both candidates to connect with the American people. While Trump has a strong following, his approach and rhetoric seem to be alienating many potential voters. As the race heats up, it will be interesting to see how Trump adapts and whether he can close the gap with Clinton.\n\nA recent correction: The quote from Trump complaining to Hannity about media coverage is a fabrication from a satire columnist.",
    " Title: U.S. and Russia's Role in Syria's Escalating Conflict Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States and Russia are escalating as the Syrian conflict continues to intensify, with both nations playing significant roles in the ongoing crisis. According to activists, the U.S. has been consulted about weapons transfers to Syria, though officials in Washington maintain that the U.S. did not participate in arms shipments to the rebels. The U.S. emphasizes the importance of ensuring that weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton has been pushing for a \"managed transition\" in Syria, under which President Bashar al-Assad would step aside. However, Russia's role is viewed as critical, and Clinton's claims about helicopter shipments are likely to increase tensions with Moscow, less than a week before President Obama is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit meeting in Mexico.\n\nThe precise nature of the helicopters in question remains classified, but Pentagon sources suggest that Clinton may have been referring to Russian-made attack helicopters that Syria already owns but has not yet deployed against opposition forces. While these helicopters, known as Mi-24s, are flown by Syrian pilots, Russia supplies spare parts and provides maintenance for them.\n\nThe use of helicopters is contributing to a growing sense that the conflict in Syria could be characterized as a civil war. United Nations peacekeeping operations head Herv\u00e9 Ladsous stated that the Syrian government has lost significant territory to the opposition and is attempting to retake control, using tanks, artillery, and attack helicopters.\n\nOpposition leaders are wary of the term \"civil war\" because it suggests an even match. Samir Nachar, a member of the Syrian National Council, stated, \"Civil war will not come suddenly in one day or two or five, but you have to look how things are gradually changing on the ground.\"\n\nIn addition to the U.S. and Russia, Turkey has also been involved in the conflict, with reports of Turkish Army vehicles delivering antitank weaponry to the Syrian border, which is then smuggled into Syria. Turkey has denied providing anything other than humanitarian aid to the opposition.\n\nThe more powerful weapons have been delivered as far south as the suburbs of Damascus, but not into the city itself, according to sources in the Syrian National Council. The presence of antitank missiles seems to have made government forces hesitant to move their tanks around urban centers.\n\nDespite the delivery of weapons, the violence in Syria continues unabated. On Tuesday, a team of United Nations cease-fire monitors retreated before reaching Al Heffa in the northwest when hostile crowds attacked their vehicles with stones and metal rods.\n\nThe debate over Russia's rearming of Syria took an unusual turn on Tuesday when Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, criticized the U.S. military for buying attack helicopters for Afghan security forces from the same Russian weapons company supplying the Assad government. Pentagon press secretary George Little defended the purchases, stating that they were necessary to help Afghanistan create a credible self-defense force.",
    " Title: Political Science Professor Predicts High Chance of President Trump's Re-election Based on Historical Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nA political science professor from Stony Brook University, Helmut Norpoth, has predicted that President Donald Trump is likely to be re-elected in the upcoming presidential election. Norpoth's prediction is based on a model he developed that has accurately predicted 25 out of the last 27 presidential elections.\n\nIn 2016, Norpoth's model predicted Trump's victory, despite the polls indicating otherwise. The model gave Trump an 87-99% chance of beating Hillary Clinton a year before the election, a prediction that was met with skepticism from many pollsters and pundits.\n\nAccording to Norpoth's model, President Trump has a 91% chance of being reelected. The model also suggests that Trump could secure a larger Electoral College majority this time around compared to his 2016 victory.\n\nThe professor's model emphasizes the importance of a candidate's early enthusiasm in the nominating process, discounting the significance of opinion polls. Currently, polls show Joe Biden leading over Trump, but Norpoth cautions that many candidates have led in the polls in the spring but lost in the fall.\n\n\"The terrain of presidential contests is littered with nominees who saw a poll lead in the spring turn to dust in the fall,\" Norpoth said.\n\nWith the election still several months away, polls can change significantly, especially after the candidates hold their nominating conventions and participate in presidential debates. While the Biden campaign has stated that Biden will engage in three debates with Trump, there are concerns about whether these debates will actually take place, given Biden's perceived gaffes and questions about his mental abilities.\n\nRecently, a clip of Biden went viral on Twitter, raising questions about his mental abilities. The clip shows Biden struggling to answer a question during an interview.\n\nReaders are encouraged to engage in discussions about this material through the news outlet's Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram accounts.",
    " Title: Iranian Oil Tanker Suffers Explosions Off Saudi Coast, Iran Blames 'Terrorist Attack'\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Iranian oil tanker, the Sabiti, owned by The National Iran Oil Company, has been struck by two explosions approximately 60 miles from the port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian news agency ISNA. The incident occurred around 5am local time on Friday.\n\nThe explosions reportedly caused damage to two main storage tanks on board the vessel, resulting in oil leaks into the Red Sea. The Iranian tanker, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil, remains afloat and is currently heading back towards the Persian Gulf, according to tracking data.\n\nThe National Iranian Tanker Company stated that contrary to reports, there is no fire aboard the ship, and the vessel is completely stable. The crew of the Sabiti is reported to be safe, and the leak has been controlled, according to Iranian news agency Nour, which is close to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not commented on the reported attack, and U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, currently positioned near Iran, has declined to comment further on the incident. The attack follows a series of incidents targeting tankers and oil facilities in the region, which have been blamed on Iran.\n\nIran has not yet identified who it believes is responsible for the attack on the Sabiti. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi stated that the attack was carried out by those committing \"dangerous adventurism.\" Mousavi added that the Sabiti was struck twice in a half-hour span, and an investigation is underway.\n\nBefore Friday, the Sabiti had not activated its transmitter for 57 days, when it was in the port of Bandar Abbas. Data shows the tanker is now heading back to the Persian Gulf with a destination of Larak, an island in the Strait of Hormuz. It is unclear what the tanker's initial destination was.\n\nOil prices surged more than two percent following the attack, with Brent rising 2.3 percent to $60.46, and West Texas Intermediate jumping 2.1 percent to $54.69. The incident comes amidst months of tensions in the Arabian Peninsula, which has seen attacks on tankers, drones, and oil facilities.\n\nIn May, four tankers\u2014two belonging to Saudi Arabia, one to Norway, and one to the UAE\u2014were struck by explosions near the UAE in the Gulf of Oman. An investigation by the UAE, America, and France concluded that holes in the vessels were likely caused by explosive charges placed near the waterline. The US accused Iran of being responsible for the attacks, though may not have directly carried them out.\n\nThe attacks led to spiraling tensions around the Gulf, which saw Tehran shoot down an American Navy drone, almost leading to the US bombing Iran. Tensions rose further last month when a Saudi refinery and oil field were hit by drones and missiles, which the kingdom said were fired by Iran. The explosions shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production\u2014more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nThe ongoing instability in the region stems from President Trump's withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal, signed under Barack Obama. The deal, which was also backed by European powers including Russia, had promised the Iranian regime economic benefits in return for curtailing its nuclear program in a way that would stop it from developing weapons. Trump reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran last year, prompting Tehran to stop complying with the deal by accelerating its enrichment of uranium and rebuilding stockpiles. The President has said he wants to negotiate a new deal with Tehran, but Iran has refused to enter fresh talks, urging the US to return to the terms of the original deal.\n\nWhile European countries have tried to establish economic measures to skirt the American sanctions, these have been largely ineffective. The ongoing tensions and attacks in the region continue to pose a significant threat to global oil supplies and economic stability.",

He said he believes Beijing wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the election to ease the pressure Trump has placed on China over trade and other issues.\n\nIn Beijing, China's foreign ministry said it has no interest in interfering in the U.S. presidential election. Spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters during a daily briefing that the Nov. 3 election was the internal affair of the United States and that Beijing hoped Americans would not try to drag China into it.\n\nTrump said the Phase 1 trade deal that he concluded with Chinese President Xi Jinping aimed at reducing chronic U.S. trade deficits with China had been \"upset very badly\" by the economic fallout from the virus, which first surfaced in China late last year.\n\nA senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that an informal \"truce\" in the war of words that Trump and Xi essentially agreed to in a phone call in late March now appeared to be over.\n\nThe two leaders had promised their governments would do everything possible to cooperate to contain the coronavirus. In recent days, Washington and Beijing have traded increasingly bitter recriminations over the origin of the virus and the response to it.\n\nHowever, Trump and his top aides, while stepping up their anti-China rhetoric, have stopped short of directly criticizing Xi, who the U.S. president has repeatedly called his \"friend.\"\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- China says it has no interest in meddling in U.S. election\n\nTrump had initially praised Xi and his government for their response and \"transparency\" over the virus.\n\nTrump also said South Korea has agreed to pay the United States more money for a defense cooperation agreement, but he would not be drawn out on how much.\n\nThe United States stations roughly 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than with a peace treaty.\n\nTrump is leading a triage effort to try to keep the U.S. economy afloat through stimulus payments to individuals and companies while nudging state governors to carefully reopen their states as new infections decline.\n\nTrump sounded wistful about the strong economy that he had enjoyed compared with now, when millions of people have lost their jobs and gross domestic product is faltering.\n\n\"We were rocking before this happened. We had the greatest economy in history,\" he said.\n\nHe said he is happy with the way many governors are operating under the strain of the pandemic but said some needed to improve. He would not name them.\n\nTrump's handling of the virus has come under scrutiny. Forty-three percent of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from April 27-28.\n\nBut there was some good news in the coronavirus battle on Wednesday, as Gilead Sciences Inc said its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir was showing progress in treating virus victims.\n\nTrump has also sought an accelerated timetable on development of a vaccine. \"I think things are moving along very nicely,\" he said.\n\nAt the end of the half-hour interview, Trump offered lighthearted remarks about a newly released Navy video purportedly showing an unidentified flying object. \"I just wonder if it's real,\" he said. \"That's a hell of a video.\"",

Butina, who pleaded not guilty, later admitted to a single count of conspiracy in December.\n\nIn a court hearing in Washington DC on Friday, Butina, 30, expressed remorse for her actions, stating, \"I destroyed my own life. I came to the United States not under any orders, but with hope, and now nothing remains but penitence.\"\n\nButina's actions, according to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, \"jeopardized\" the country's national security. Despite Butina's apology, the judge fully complied with the government's sentencing recommendation.\n\nIn her plea agreement, Butina admitted to working with former Russian lawmaker Alexander Torshin to infiltrate the NRA and pursue backdoor channels of communication with American conservatives who could influence US politics. She failed to report her activities to US authorities, as required by law.\n\nButina had faced a maximum of five years in prison. The case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement read in court, one of the prosecutors said Butina had drafted a document called \"Diplomacy Project\" in March 2015, which called for unofficial communication lines between high-ranking US officials and Russia.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington described Butina as a \"political prisoner\" and demanded her immediate release, using the hashtag \"#FreeMariaButina\" on its Facebook page. The Russian government has previously described the case as \"fabricated.\"\n\nButina is expected to be credited with the nine months she has already served in jail and will face immediate deportation after her sentence is complete. Despite her plea for leniency, the judge wished Butina well, stating, \"You are a young woman, you are smart, you are hardworking.\"",
    " Title: Senior Republicans Break Ranks, Consider Tax Increases Amid Budget Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from their long-held stance, several senior Republicans are willing to consider raising revenue through taxes as part of a deal with Democrats to avoid a looming budget crisis. This change in position marks a departure from the party's traditional opposition to tax increases.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker, for instance, has stated that he will honor only his oath of office, distancing himself from the anti-tax pledge that conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist has long advocated. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, from Virginia, has downplayed the significance of the pledge in his home state, suggesting that it is not a topic of discussion among Washington's political leaders. Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss has expressed similar sentiments, stating that he cares more about his country than adhering to Norquist's pledge.\n\nThis shift in stance is particularly noteworthy given the Republican Party's historical resistance to tax increases. As Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama's White House engage in intense negotiations, they are seeking ways to reach an agreement on tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic, drastic changes take effect at the new year.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, while still supporting Norquist's goals, acknowledged the need to address the current crisis and the political reality of President Obama's victory. The questioning of Norquist's pledge has led to speculation about the diminishing influence of the little-known Republican within the GOP.\n\nNorquist, the head of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, has maintained a significant level of influence for years, despite not holding public office. His pledge, which does not allow any change to the tax code that adds a dollar to revenues, has been signed by 279 lawmakers, according to Americans for Tax Reform. However, with some lawmakers having second thoughts about the pledge, the number of those bound by the promise is expected to decrease when the new House is seated next year.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Peter King of New York are among those who have expressed a willingness to put additional tax revenues on the table as a bargaining chip for a deal with Democrats. They are seeking changes in Social Security and Medicare and reductions in federal deficits in return for tax increases.\n\nThe debate over the pledge and tax increases is a complex one, with historical precedents such as President George H.W. Bush's broken campaign promise not to raise taxes in 1992 serving as a reminder of the political risks associated with tax increases. However, the current economic situation and the pressing need to address the nation's debt crisis are compelling many Republicans to reconsider their stance on tax increases.",
    " Title: HHS Spends $2.7 Billion on Health Care Law Despite Conservative Calls for Pause Ahead of Supreme Court Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has distributed over $2.7 billion in grants and awards since oral arguments ended on March 28. This is more than double the amount distributed in the three-month period preceding the arguments, according to a review of funding announcements from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhile much of this funding was already in the pipeline before March, the timing for the distribution of specific funds is not rigid, allowing the agency some flexibility in the types of funds it disperses. The Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision this week.\n\nThe $2.7 billion includes grants and awards handed out since the Supreme Court arguments, including over $90 million in funds for health insurance cooperatives, which HHS announced on Friday. In contrast, the administration distributed approximately $1 billion in grants, loans, and other awards during the three months before the Supreme Court arguments.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson disputed the notion that there was any change in the timeline due to the court. \"This story is flat-out wrong. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act more than two years ago, we have worked continuously to implement the law and to educate the American people about the benefits,\" the spokesperson said. \"The premise of the story does not take into account the timeline of implementation.\"\n\nSome Republicans have advocated for a halt in the implementation of the law until the Supreme Court ruling is announced. Last year, for instance, a draft of the House Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which provides funding for health care agencies, would have frozen all spending on health reform until the court ruled. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) has been pushing a bill that would have blocked any further implementation of the law before the ruling.\n\nRep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies, who authored the appropriations bill that would have put implementation funding on hold, criticized the latest HHS spending in a statement provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\"It was irresponsible to spend a single dollar implementing the law before the Supreme Court rules, and I fought hard to prevent that money from being spent,\" Rehberg said.",
    " Title: Biden's Remarks Highlight the Role of Social Norms in Black Political Loyalty and the Implications for Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, President Joe Biden's comments about black Americans and their support for the Democratic Party have sparked controversy, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of racial politics and the role of social norms in maintaining party loyalty among black Americans.\n\nTwo political scientists, Ismail White and Chryl Laird, in their book \"Steadfast Democrats,\" offer insights into this issue. Their research suggests that black Americans enforce party loyalty as a social norm, prioritizing group solidarity in party politics to maintain their political strength as a minority group. This partisan loyalty is maintained through a process they call \"racialized social constraint,\" where support for the Democratic Party is seen as an expectation of political behavior that empowers the racial group.\n\nIn an experiment during the 2012 presidential election, White and Laird found that when black participants were in a room with a black norm enforcer, they donated more money to the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, than when they were alone or with a white norm enforcer. This research indicates that norm enforcement is most effective when the enforcer is black.\n\nHowever, Biden's comment, \"If you are for Trump, then you ain't black,\" has been met with criticism, as many black Americans do not believe that white Americans, even Democrats, have the standing to question any black person's \"blackness\" under any circumstances. The black norm of supporting the Democratic Party is aimed at empowering the group, and Biden's comment may have been perceived as suggesting that black Americans are obligated to support him, rather than the other way around.\n\nTo effectively convey his commitment to black Americans, Biden could signal his dedication to acting on the racial group's behalf. Political scientist Julian Wamble found that when candidates demonstrate their commitment to acting on behalf of the racial group, black voters are more likely to support them. This commitment can be signaled in various ways, such as showcasing social connections to prominent black individuals and organizations.\n\nBiden has often highlighted his relationship with former president Obama and regularly points to his record by saying, \"The NAACP has endorsed me every time I have run.\" Political scientist Andrea Benjamin's research suggests that such endorsements can influence black voters' decisions, particularly where race is concerned.\n\nPolitical scientists Christopher Stout and Keith Baker argue that selecting a black woman as his vice presidential nominee would go a long way in demonstrating his commitment. This move would be especially impactful given the fact that black women are a significant force within the Democratic Party.\n\nHowever, having knowledge of a group's norms does not mean that an outsider can enforce them. A more prudent course for a candidate would be to elevate into positions of power people who can enforce these norms. A black woman vice presidential nominee would be an effective signal only if black people themselves perceived her to be committed to the black community's interests.",
    " Title: Senate, White House Confident as Kavanaugh Confirmation Vote Nears Following FBI Investigation\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee and the White House have expressed confidence in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh following the completion of an FBI supplementary background investigation.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley stated that the committee had received a briefing on the FBI's supplement to Judge Kavanaugh's background investigation file. Grassley noted that there was no new information in the report that was not already known, and that neither the committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who could corroborate the allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley further stated that the investigation found no hint of misconduct, and that the same was true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Kavanaugh's 25 years of public service.\n\nThe White House also reviewed the report and issued a statement expressing confidence in Kavanaugh's confirmation. Raj Shah, the principal deputy press secretary for the White House, said that with Leader McConnell's cloture filing, senators have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation. Shah added that this is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record, and over a half million pages of documents.\n\nPresident Trump also weighed in on the confirmation battle, calling it a \"very important time in our country\" and tweeting, \"Due Process, Fairness and Common Sense are now on trial!\"\n\nWith the completion of the FBI investigation and the White House's confidence in Kavanaugh's confirmation, the Senate is expected to vote on the nomination in the coming days.",
    " Title: \"Kavanaugh Hearings: A Test of Belief and Women's Rights in America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have become a significant test of America's beliefs and a pivotal moment for women's rights. The hearings, which followed the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford, have sparked intense debate and division among Americans, particularly women.\n\nBefore the hearings, progressive women were already skeptical of Kavanaugh's social values due to his conservative stance on various issues. However, the emergence of sexual assault claims escalated their opposition. Julia Peters, a 33-year-old protester in Washington D.C., expressed her concerns, stating, \"He will be in there for a lifetime, and we know he does not stand for our values.\"\n\nGrace Perret, a college junior from New Orleans, Louisiana, is particularly concerned about the potential impact on women's rights, especially in states with \"trigger laws\" that could ban abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned. She commented, \"This would have devastating implications for poor women especially, who likely cannot afford to travel\" to other states for abortions.\n\nThe hearings have also become a platform for women to express their support for Dr. Ford. Julia Peters stated, \"We are here to let Christine Blasey Ford know we believe her.\" The hearings have sparked anger among progressive women over the dismissal of Dr. Ford's allegations by some on the right, with Ms. Perret commenting, \"The attempts by so many on the right to paint this as a coordinated political smear campaign is incredibly damaging to the anti-rape culture movement and to survivors everywhere.\"\n\nConservative women, on the other hand, are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process. Rachel Gill, a 22-year-old supporter of Kavanaugh, believes in the \"principle of innocent until proven guilty\" and wants to hear the truth. She stated, \"I'm here because I want to hear the truth, and if there is any truth to these accusations.\"\n\nSome conservative women fear the assault allegations are being weaponized by Democrats to prevent Kavanaugh's confirmation. Nancy Wilson, a grandmother of 11, traveled to Washington with two friends wearing \"I Stand With Brett\" T-shirts. They believe women are being misused and want Kavanaugh on the court because he is a \"constitutionalist judge.\"\n\nThe hearings have provided a platform for both Dr. Ford and Kavanaugh to testify, with their testimonies taking strikingly different tones. The hearings trended on social media, prompting survivors of sexual violence to share their stories. Lucy Melchor, a 36-year-old protester from Chicago, found Dr. Ford's testimony compelling and believable, while she felt Kavanaugh's testimony turned the focus away from the allegations to the political process.\n\nThe hearings have also become a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America. Democrat Ms. Melchor commented, \"If the cards fall onto the side of not believing her story, it's really detrimental for the women who have been assaulted and will be assaulted in the future.\" The hearings have highlighted the fear among progressive women that the landmark Roe v Wade decision could be overturned, potentially leading to a rollback of women's rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kavanaugh hearings have become a significant test of America's beliefs and a pivotal moment for women's rights. The hearings have sparked intense debate and division among Americans, particularly women, and have become a platform for survivors of sexual violence to share their stories. The outcome of the hearings will have significant implications for women's rights in America.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Health Care Law: A Closer Look at the Possible Outcomes\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to announce its decision on the landmark health care reform law, a range of possible outcomes has emerged, with experts focusing on a handful of the most plausible scenarios.\n\nThe court might strike down the fundamental overhaul of insurance that lies at the heart of the law, finding the individual mandate unconstitutional, and possibly dismissing the closely related requirements that insurers cover everyone who applies and not charge sick people more. Much or even all of the rest of the law might be left to stand, if it survives politically.\n\nAlternatively, the court might declare that without the insurance provisions, the rest of the statute would never have passed Congress in the first place, and that the whole bill should be rejected. This would be the most definitive possible outcome, but it seems less likely, given the speed at which these cases have moved through the courts.\n\nThe court might also essentially punt, accepting the argument that it is too soon to decide this case. This would keep the bitter partisan debate over the law going full tilt through the November elections and beyond.\n\nAnother possibility is that the court might assemble enough votes not to strike down the individual mandate, perhaps because most of the justices decide the commerce powers of Congress permit it, or because a few of them find other justifications or approaches. Reversing an Atlanta appeals court, this would leave the whole law standing, a significant victory for the Obama administration.\n\nBefore the oral arguments, many thought this outcome most likely; sharp questioning in the courtroom undermined that expectation, but did not put it completely to rest.\n\nThe court's decision on the health care law will have far-reaching implications, and it is important to bear in mind the arguments the court invited and heard on seemingly tangential questions. For example, if even one justice decided it was premature to vote for striking down the mandate because the Anti-Injunction Act says taxes can not be appealed until they are actually levied, that might tilt the balance on the main issue.\n\nThe question of expanding Medicaid also has little to do with the other arguments in the case, except that the financial burden gave the states standing to sue. However, with the individual mandate's guarantee of universal coverage hanging in the balance, the expansion of Medicaid to millions of additional people for whom private insurance is out of reach could help assure that if the law survives, insurance reaches as many people as possible.\n\nOnce the opinions are handed down and posted online, it will take experts just a few minutes to thumb through the thick documents and locate the gist of what the court has wrought. As the scope of their judgment starts to sink in, one or more justices will still be reading aloud from the bench, expounding on their own views and rationales in somewhat terser and maybe much more vivid words. As the logic of what they have done ripples through the body politic, a much larger public debate will ensue. And the words in the lengthy opinions will reverberate in case law for years to come.",
    " Title: Newt Gingrich Discusses Trump's Presidential Campaign, Potential VP Role, and Syrian Refugee Test\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed his support for Donald Trump as a \"necessary candidate\" reflecting a global anti-establishment sentiment. Gingrich also suggested a test to vet Syrian refugees based on Sharia law, stating it as a means to ensure the safety of Western civilization.\n\nGingrich, who is attending a gathering of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran outside Paris, expressed his belief that Trump's presidential candidacy is part of a worldwide movement against the establishment. He stated, \"Trump is part of that worldwide movement, a movement toward really being angry at the establishment, really feeling cheated by the establishment, really feeling that government has failed.\"\n\nRegarding his potential role as Trump's running mate, Gingrich stated that he has been vetted for the job but has yet to decide whether to partner with Trump if asked. He emphasized that his decision would not be an automatic yes, stating, \"I think we would want to talk it through and make sure we knew what the job was and what he had in mind because it's not an automatic yes.\"\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are other possible Trump running mates. Gingrich also commented on the British vote to leave the EU and electoral successes in Europe by populists, stating, \"It's a worldwide movement toward really being angry at the establishment, really feeling cheated by the establishment, really feeling that government has failed.\"\n\nGingrich also reiterated his remarks about racism in the United States, stating that white parents cannot know the fears of black parents. He said, \"It's an objective reality that if you are a white parent with teenagers you have dramatically less fear of the police walking up to them than if you're a black parent with black teenagers.\"\n\nGingrich also expressed his views on Syrian refugees, stating that the U.S. government lacks the ability to vet who these people are and that a test on whether or not a person believes in Sharia law would be revelatory because belief in Islamic law is incompatible with secular law. He did not elaborate on how such a test would be administered.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Primary: Marco Rubio's Debate Performance Sparks Controversy Among Republican Contenders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Marco Rubio's uneven debate performance has stirred a fervor among a trio of governors aiming to curb his momentum in the Republican race for the presidency. Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush are challenging Rubio's qualifications, with Christie launching a series of withering attacks during Saturday's debate.\n\nChristie's real-time critique of Rubio's reliance on rehearsed talking points has shifted the Republican contest's narrative, according to the New Jersey governor. \"There was a march amongst some in the chattering class to anoint Sen. Rubio,\" Christie said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I think after last night, that's over.\"\n\nThe governors' White House aspirations hinge on a strong showing in New Hampshire. Without a significant victory, each will face mounting pressure from Republican Party leaders eager to consolidate support behind a single candidate capable of challenging Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the top-two finishers in the lead-off Iowa caucuses.\n\nTrump has maintained a commanding lead in New Hampshire preference polls for months, while Cruz is in the mix with Rubio and the governors. Cruz's campaign, however, is more focused on the Southern states that follow later in the primary calendar.\n\nA Monmouth University survey released Sunday shows Trump with a commanding double-digit lead over his Republican rivals, with 30 percent of likely Republican primary voters saying they would vote for him. Rubio, Kasich, Bush, and Cruz are statistically tied for second place, with 13, 14, 13, and 12 percent support, respectively.\n\nWhile most candidates remained unchanged in their polling numbers from last month's Monmouth survey, Bush jumped nine points since January. The survey indicated that just 9 percent of N.H. Republican voters are undecided.\n\nRubio's debate stumble came when he was challenged about his qualifications, repeatedly falling back on a retort meant to distinguish himself from President Barack Obama, who also won the White House as a first-term senator.\n\nBarbara O'Brien, an undecided voter who had been considering voting for Rubio, was among those swayed by his debate performance. \"He kept saying the same thing over and over again,\" said O'Brien, a 67-year-old from Manchester who is one of New Hampshire's many registered independents. \"He did not look presidential.\"\n\nRubio's campaign reported raising $600,000 during the debate, three times more than it has brought in during previous debates. The fundraising numbers were unverifiable.\n\nRubio's crowds remained large and enthusiastic on Sunday, and some of the many undecided voters who attended his events said they were more bothered by Christie's aggressive demeanor.\n\n\"It was tiresome,\" said Katherine Bringhurst, a 66-year-old retired office manager. She's undecided heading into Tuesday's election, but leaning toward Rubio.\n\nMaria Tourlitis, an independent from Hudson, decided to vote for Rubio after hearing him speak in her hometown on Saturday. As she greeted the senator after the event, she leaned in and said: \"At the next debate, please stand up to Christie.\"\n\nIf Christie's aggressive attacks on Rubio result in his own standing tumbling, it could benefit Bush and Kasich. Both stepped back in the debate to allow Christie to take the lead in targeting Rubio, though they were happy to relish in the afterglow.\n\n\"He's a great speaker,\" Bush said of Rubio, his one-time political prot\u00e9g\u00e9, on Fox News Sunday. \"But he came across as totally scripted and kind of robotic.\"\n\nKasich has prided himself on avoiding direct criticism of his rivals during the campaign, and kept up that strategy both in the debate and as he campaigned Sunday.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be great if we could win being positive?\" Kasich said on Fox News.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Continued Restrictions on Immigrants Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump Administration has faced criticism for its continued restrictions on immigrants, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to implement measures that were previously unattainable.\n\nIn the latest instance, the CDC's recent Amendment and Extension, which \"suspends the introduction of certain 'covered aliens' into the United States for a period of 30 days,\" has been a point of contention. According to the CDC, the extension was made due to the increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nThe amendment allows the administration another means to deny entry to those attempting to seek refuge in the United States, fleeing violence and civil war. This policy echoes similar attacks against immigrant children and their parents in 2018, which included the caging of children, separation of families, detention of families, and a continued failure to reunite them.\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions orchestrated this new \"zero tolerance\" policy, and later prosecuted those caught entering the U.S. as part of the same policy. The administration's actions resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents, and the loss of nearly 6,000 unaccompanied immigrant children.\n\nIn June 2018, the Trump administration ended the policy of family separation but replaced it with a policy of family detention. The cessation of family separation practices only occurred after significant public pressure.\n\nLater that year, Trump directed Sessions to alter a 2015 court order titled Reno v. Flores, also known as the Flores Settlement. This settlement provided immigrant children with protection, ensuring they would not be detained for more than 20 days and would be released to a licensed care program within those 20 days. However, the administration has undermined both aspects of this protection by altering the rule that allows them to detain children for more than 20 days.\n\nThe CDC Amendment and Extension has enabled the administration to expedite the deportation of children during the ongoing pandemic. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrants' Rights Project, stated in an interview with CBS that \"this is the most extreme of the Trump administration's anti-children anti-asylum policies.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has also expressed concern, stating that \"the United States government should immediately impose a moratorium on deportations during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid contributing to the global spread of the virus.\" Despite this advice, the U.S. has continued to deport people, with HRW reporting that \"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out 232 deportation flights to Latin America and Caribbean countries between February 3 and April 24, 2020.\"\n\nSome of those deported tested positive for COVID-19 and were sent to Mexico, Haiti, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In March and April alone, nearly 21,000 removals were carried out, including 899 expulsions of unaccompanied children as young as 10.\n\nChildren being processed under the new CDC Amendment are not being allowed to apply for humanitarian protections they previously had. Instead, they are being deported to their home countries, disregarding due process.\n\nTo stay updated on news like this, subscribe to our newsletter here.",

This marks a significant increase in job openings, with the job openings rate rising to 3.9% in July, up from 3.6% in the prior three months.\n\nThe number of hires and separations, collectively known as turnover, also saw a slight decrease in July. Hires edged down to 5.0 million from 5.2 million in June, while total separations, which includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations, decreased to 4.7 million from 4.9 million in June.\n\nThe quits rate remained steady at 1.9% for the fourth consecutive month, indicating a consistent level of worker confidence and job market stability. The layoffs and discharges rate also decreased to 1.1%, signaling a decline in involuntary separations initiated by employers.\n\nSeveral industries experienced a rise in job openings in July, including professional and business services, accommodation and food services, retail trade, and nondurable goods manufacturing. The Northeast and South regions also saw an increase in job openings.\n\nOver the 12-month period ending in July, job openings increased for total nonfarm and total private, while the number of hires remained relatively stable. The number of hires increased in accommodation and food services and federal government, but decreased in construction and arts, entertainment, and recreation.\n\nTotal separations, or turnover, decreased over the year in several industries, with the largest decreases occurring in mining and logging and federal government. The number of hires increased over the year in accommodation and food services, while it decreased in construction and educational services.\n\nQuits increased over the year in several industries, with the largest increases occurring in accommodation and food services, state and local government, and educational services. Quits decreased over the year in finance and insurance and nondurable goods manufacturing.\n\nLayoffs and discharges decreased over the year in several industries, with the largest decreases occurring in construction and educational services. The number of layoffs and discharges increased over the year in mining and logging and federal government.\n\nOther separations, which include separations due to retirement, death, disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm, increased over the year in several industries, with the largest increases occurring in construction, health care and social assistance, and accommodation and food services.\n\nOverall, the July BLS report indicates a robust job market, with a record high in job openings and a steady level of worker confidence, as indicated by the quits rate. However, the slight decrease in hires and total separations suggests a potential slowdown in hiring and job turnover.",
    " Title: White House Seeks $14 Billion in Emergency Funding for Hurricane Harvey Recovery Efforts\n\nThe Trump administration has requested an initial $14 billion in emergency relief funding from Congress to aid in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Harvey, with $7.85 billion requested on Friday and an additional $6.7 billion expected to be requested in a stopgap spending measure by the end of September.\n\nAccording to a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan, the White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney is requesting $7.4 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund. The administration is also seeking the previously anticipated $450 billion for a Small Business Administration (SBA) program.\n\nThe request is more than previously anticipated, with earlier reports suggesting that the president was expected to ask for $5.5 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund and another $450 billion for the SBA program.\n\nThe money requested by the White House on Friday marks only a fraction of what relief efforts in Texas and Louisiana will eventually cost. Congress is already facing a jam-packed legislative agenda this month, with lawmakers under pressure to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29 and must also strike a spending deal to fund the government past the end of the month.\n\nPresident Trump is set to visit Texas for the second time in less than a week on Saturday to survey the damage from the storm, which left at least 46 people dead and caused billions of dollars in damage. He will also visit Louisiana. Trump met with local and state officials in the Corpus Christi area on Tuesday, as the storm moved north, hitting the Houston area with a torrent of rain and historic floodwaters.",
    " Title: Justice Department Initiates Process to Ban Bump Stocks Following President Trump's Executive Order\n\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated the process to ban bump stock devices, following President Donald Trump's executive order signed on Saturday. The move aims to regulate these devices, which accelerate the rate of gunfire and enable semi-automatic guns to mimic fully automatic firearms.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DOJ has submitted a notice to the Office of Management and Budget, aiming to clarify the definition of \"machinegun\" and include bump stocks in the list of banned devices. This is the first step in the process of banning bump stocks, with the DOJ aiming to publish the notice as expeditiously as possible after approval by the office.\n\nThe order, once implemented, will prohibit individuals from owning, selling, and manufacturing bump stocks. President Trump, in a statement, emphasized his commitment to ensuring the safety and security of every American.\n\nBump stocks were found among the weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting that took 58 lives in October 2017. These bump-fire devices utilize the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to rapidly pull the trigger, mimicking fully automatic firing. The Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest in recent U.S. history, rekindled the debate on the legality of these devices.\n\nCongress banned the sale and manufacture of machine guns for civilian use in 1986, and machine guns in circulation before then are tightly regulated, limited in number, and expensive. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has debated over the devices for years, issuing a series of opinions, determining that the devices were lawful.\n\nTrump took on the issue following the Valentine's Day high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Students and gun-control advocates have pressured him and other lawmakers to reevaluate current gun laws. He announced the order on bump stocks last month after meeting with survivors of the shooting.\n\n\"We must do more to protect our children,\" Trump said, reiterating that school safety is a top priority of his administration.",
    " Title: Conservative Response to President Obama's Inaugural Address: A Hardening Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing President Obama's second inaugural address, conservative voices have expressed a hardening stance towards the president, viewing his speech as a reaffirmation of his liberal ideology rather than an attempt to bridge political divides.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, spoke on the Laura Ingraham Show on Tuesday, echoing the sentiments of many conservatives. Ryan stated, \"That's what inaugural speeches are meant to be: campaign's over, bring everybody together and try to unify. That's not the speech we got.\"\n\nRyan criticized the president for misrepresenting the Republican position on entitlement beneficiaries, stating that GOP policymakers do not label those who receive \"earned entitlements\" like Social Security and Medicare as \"takers.\" Instead, Ryan argued, conservatives are discussing beneficiaries who receive entitlements like Medicaid, which they did not pay for through payroll taxes.\n\nSenate Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John Thune, also criticized the president's speech, viewing it as a return to a liberal agenda. McConnell stated, \"One thing that's pretty clear from the president's speech yesterday\u2014the era of liberalism is back.\" Thune added, \"We were reminded yesterday that this is a liberal president with a liberal agenda, which is why the words'spending' and 'debt' probably were not included in that speech.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS, a nonprofit linked to Karl Rove's American Crossroads political action committee, also released a video on Tuesday, criticizing Obama's liberal agenda. The video ends with the question, \"If the media is calling Obama's policies liberal, what can we expect in the next four years?\"\n\nNicholas Eberstadt, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, offered a conservative interpretation of the president's speech, suggesting that Obama's defiant tone may have contributed to Republican antagonism. Eberstadt stated, \"The president's argument is that we have finished discussing the welfare state. We are not in the 'if you have a better idea, let me hear it' portion of the show anymore.\"\n\nThe conservative response to President Obama's inaugural address suggests a hardening stance towards the president, with many viewing his speech as a reaffirmation of his liberal ideology rather than an attempt to bridge political divides.",

In a series of town halls, rallies, and interviews, the candidates are emphasizing their unique qualifications, policy proposals, and reasons why they are the best choice to take on President Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who hosted a tele-town hall from Washington D.C. earlier this week, argued that women are better positioned than men to win in competitive races. \"The data shows that women have been outperforming men as candidates in competitive races ever since Donald Trump got in,\" Warren told a precinct captain from Boone, Iowa, who joined the Tuesday call. \"Women have been doing really well since Donald Trump was inaugurated,\" she said, and \"2020 is not 2016.\"\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar made a last-minute trip to a bar in Council Bluffs on Tuesday, where she was met by around 100 supporters. She also did more than 20 TV and newspaper interviews in a span of five days last week to reach voters while participating in the impeachment trial.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders' closing argument leans on the consistency of his progressive record and his grassroots movement. \"I am here, but I'd rather be there,\" Sanders told a Wednesday night rally in Iowa City, calling in from D.C. during a break from the impeachment trial. Sanders ticked off his plans as president, including raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana, passing his Medicare for All bill, protecting women's reproductive rights, fighting climate change, restricting gun access, and overhauling immigration policy.\n\nJoe Biden has been arguing that he offers stability and will build on the Obama years, while itching for a fight with Trump over guns, health care, foreign policy, national security, morality, and personality. \"Trump and I have already gone one round with each other on health care,\" Biden said of his help for down-ballot Democrats in the 2018 midterms.\n\nChristie Vilsack, the wife of former Governor Tom Vilsack, who has endorsed Biden, said he is the \"rock solid\" choice for Iowans in 2020. Neither Biden nor Sanders mentioned any rival Democrat in events observed over the past two days.\n\nSome voters, volunteers, and campaign staffers said 2016 still haunts them. Michael Moore, a filmmaker and Sanders' national campaign co-chair, told a rally that Hillary Clinton \"refused\" to go to Wisconsin in 2016 and did not give people a reason to vote for her.\n\nVoters, volunteers, and campaign staffers said there is a hunger for policy, but also a burning desire to defeat Trump. \"I want to start hearing people really hammer on Trump because I think they've taken it too easy,\" said Stuart Howe, an undecided voter I met at a Biden campaign stop in Waukee. The Iowa caucus will take place on Monday, February 3.",
    " Title: Attorney General Holder's Threat to Dismantle Ferguson Police Department: A Closer Look at the Possibilities and Limitations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Attorney General Eric Holder stated on Friday that he was prepared to use all the powers at the federal government's disposal to bring the city of Ferguson, Missouri, into compliance with the Constitution. When asked if this included \"dismantling the police force,\" Holder responded, \"If that's what's necessary, we're prepared to do that.\" However, it is crucial to understand the limitations of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) power and the complexities involved in such a drastic measure.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to clarify that the DOJ does not have the power to dismantle local police departments at will. The way it is likely to \"work with\" the City of Ferguson, as Holder also hinted today, is by drawing up an agreement where Ferguson's police would still be independent, but would be monitored by the DOJ. This agreement would be enforced in federal court, and the feds would only take over if the city failed, and failed badly, to make the changes laid out in the agreement.\n\nThis nearly happened in Oakland in 2012; as a compromise, the federal government fired the police chief but left the department under the city's control. However, it took a full decade after the agreement was first signed. If dismantling happens, it will be something the city agrees to do itself\u2014or even suggests to begin with. That also means the city would be in charge of putting together whatever is going to replace the Ferguson PD.\n\nGetting rid of the police in Ferguson would only address half of the problems identified by the federal government. The Department of Justice also found massive discrimination and Constitutional violations in the municipal court system, including arresting people for showing up to court without being able to afford a court fee; suspending drivers' licenses of people who did not even know that they had a court date, let alone missed one; and setting jail bonds not based on what someone would be able to pay, but based on making the most money for the city.\n\nThere's no way the federal government's going to be satisfied if Ferguson reforms its police but leaves its courts the way they are. Disbanding the police department might allow the city to focus on reforming the courts, but it won't be enough on its own. More importantly, though, who would do police work in Ferguson after the Ferguson police force gets dismantled?\n\nTypically, a nearby police force is brought in to take over: either temporarily, while a new police department is hired from the chief down, or permanently, on a contract. And it's not at all clear whether other police departments in the St. Louis area are any better. After all, residents had plenty of experience with the St. Louis County police last summer during the protests after Michael Brown's death\u2014and they did not treat protesters any better than Ferguson police did.\n\nThe DOJ report certainly indicates that the problem in St. Louis is bigger than Ferguson. In fact, some of the things it faults the Ferguson police for doing are things they're being asked to do by other jurisdictions, like arresting people without warrants based on requests from police in other departments. By the same token, many of the unfair court practices the DOJ found appear to be pretty typical in municipal courts in the area.\n\nThe report even says: \"Individuals\u2019 experiences with other law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County, including with the police departments in surrounding municipalities and the County Police, in many instances have contributed to a general distrust of law enforcement that impacts interactions with the Ferguson police and municipal court.\"\n\nIf Eric Holder wants to dismantle the problems facing the criminal-justice system throughout the St. Louis area, he's welcome to try\u2014but it's going to take a lot more investigations and potential lawsuits than the one he has going right now.",
    " Title: Obama's Foreign Policy Legacy: A Blend of Wilsonian and Anti-Wilsonian Elements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his new residence at 2446 Belmont Road, Washington D.C., former President Barack Obama finds himself in close proximity to the home of Woodrow Wilson, who spent his post-presidential years at 2340 S Street. Wilson's foreign policy failure, the rejection of the U.S. participation in the League of Nations, serves as a stark contrast to Obama's foreign policy legacy, which he leaves with a sense of serenity, as he believes the world views America as stronger and more respected than it did eight years ago.\n\nHowever, two nations, Russia and China, have shown little regard for Obama's policies. Russia is dismembering Ukraine, and China is shredding international law by turning the South China Sea into a militarized territory. Obama's policies, a mix of Wilsonian and anti-Wilsonian elements, aimed to reorder the world in a way that would make it unnecessary for America to have grand ambitions.\n\nProgressives, who believe in humanity's natural sociability, view peace among nations as natural and spontaneous. They believe that if other nations would cleanse their minds of superstitions, they would recognize the universal validity and demonstrable utility of American principles. Wilson, who is considered a favorite philosopher by many progressives, believed that these principles are shared by \"forward-looking men and women everywhere\" and \"every modern nation.\"\n\nObama, however, seemed to doubt that America has much to teach the world, beyond post-Iraq modesty and the power of diplomacy's soft power to tame the world. Despite the failure of diplomacy in ending the Syrian civil war, Obama believed that the complex and sectarian society's civil war could be ended diplomatically. Russian President Vladimir Putin picked a side and helped it win.\n\nThe world today is more disorderly and less lawful than when Obama became president. This is less his fault than the fault of human nature, which is inherently desirous, competitive, and prone to conflict. This human nature, as Obama's foreign policy demonstrates, often causes progressives to furrow their brows in puzzlement.\n\nIn 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Secretary of State John Kerry was disappointed with Putin, saying, \"You just don't in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion.\" Obama's foreign policy presumed the existence of \"the community of nations,\" a concept that is oxymoronic, as different nations affirm different notions of justice, and a community consists of people made cohesive by a consensus about the nature of justice.\n\nOne of Obama's second-worst unforced errors, second to declaring and then abandoning a \"red line\" about Syrian chemical weapons, was involving the U.S. military in regime change in Libya. This venture, which seemed to appeal to Obama because it was untainted by any discernible connection with American national interest, was conducted by \"leading from behind.\"\n\nAs time passes, foreign policy will be conducted by a man who, although in 2010 he said WikiLeaks' Julian Assange deserves the death penalty, now seems to trust Assange on the subject of Russian hacking more than he trusts the consensus of the nation's $53 billion civilian intelligence institutions. The future remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the passage of time does not always bring progress, and human nature continues to prove that history does not have a mind of its own.",
    " Title: California Consumer Privacy Act: A Comprehensive Guide to the State's New Data Protection Law\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's landmark privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), is set to go into effect on January 1, 2020, giving residents unprecedented control over their online data. This legislation, considered the \"most comprehensive\" privacy law in the United States, empowers California residents with a range of tools to protect their personal information and holds businesses accountable for their data handling practices.\n\nThe CCPA grants California residents the right to demand companies disclose the information they collect on them, request a copy of that information, and have their data deleted upon request. Companies will also be prohibited from selling information if the consumer instructs them to via a mandatory \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" link on the company's website.\n\nConsumers will also have the right to receive equal service and pricing, regardless of whether they exercise their privacy rights. This means companies cannot treat a user differently because they have requested their data.\n\nThe law will be enforced by the California attorney general, with businesses facing fines of $2,500 to $7,500 per violation if the violation is deemed intentional. Companies will have a 30-day period to address a violation after receiving a consumer's request.\n\nBusinesses with an annual gross revenue in excess of $25 million, those deriving 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information, or businesses that annually buy, receive, sell, or share the personal information of more than 50,000 consumers, households, or devices for commercial purposes will be required to comply with the new regulations.\n\nWhile consumers in California will be most directly affected by the new law, the ripple effects may extend to non-residents as well. Peter Yared, the founder and CEO of data management company InCountry, noted that similar laws are emerging worldwide, and companies are setting up to handle data requests.\n\nTo obtain a copy of their data, consumers can send a \"verifiable consumer request\" to a business. The company is then required to comply with the request within 45 days of receipt, with a maximum extension of 90 days total. Consumers may only make a request for information twice a year, and only for a 12-month look-back period.\n\nThe CCPA has been compared to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with both laws aiming to protect consumer data. However, the GDPR's scope is broader, affecting all businesses that handle user data, while the CCPA applies only to businesses with a gross revenue over $25 million, more than 50,000 customers, or whose revenue is 50% or more based on user data.\n\nThe CCPA provides more explicit \"opt out\" options for users who do not want their personal data sold, while the GDPR does not necessarily require individual consent for data collection and use. The rules also differ in their approaches to the collection of children's data. Under GDPR, parents must provide consent for the processing of data of children under the age of 16, while the CCPA requires businesses to obtain consent from parents of children ages 13 and under, with kids older than 13 able to provide their own consent.\n\nSome advocates argue that the CCPA does not go far enough, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy advocates filing a request to strengthen the regulation before the comment period closed on December 6, 2019. Critics argue that the law does not do enough to address data collection and that California has few resources to enforce the law in 2020.\n\nCompanies that violate the law will also have the \"right to cure,\" meaning they can change their violating policies after they have been apprehended. This has been criticized as a \"get out of jail free card\" by privacy advocates.\n\nIn conclusion, the California Consumer Privacy Act represents a significant step forward in data protection for California residents. While the law is a step in the right direction, it remains to be seen whether it will be strong enough to effectively protect consumers' data in the face of increasing data breaches and privacy concerns.",
    " Title: Honoring the Legacy of the March on Washington: A Call for a New Voting Rights Act\n\nArticle:\n\nAs we mark the 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington, it is crucial to remember that the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and the Civil Rights Act in 1964 was not a foregone conclusion. The authors remind us that the march was a pivotal moment in building political will, but the fight for these landmark legislations was a brutal congressional battle that ended only when numerous senators and representatives, particularly Democrats, voted for what was right, despite the potential political cost to their party.\n\nFast-forward 50 years, the need for a new VRA may once again require a similar act of statesmanship, this time from Republicans, to prioritize the integrity of American democracy over partisan interests. Today, efforts to restrict voting rights are predominantly being pursued by Republicans, with a focus on suppressing African-American, Latino, and young votes in swing states that determine control of Congress and the White House.\n\nUnlike during the most vicious periods of racial segregation, these modern-day voting restrictions are not primarily motivated by overt racial animus, but rather to manipulate the electoral system. The Supreme Court's recent decision to gut the core provision of the VRA has left the task of guaranteeing the votes of minorities, young people, and the elderly in the hands of congressional Republicans.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court's conservative majority struck down the constitutionality of Section IV of the VRA, which designated the states and localities that must pre-clear changes to voting laws with the Department of Justice. In his explanation of the decision, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that \"nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically\" regarding race and voting in America.\n\nHowever, egregious attempts to restrict voting rights can still be found in states with a history of pernicious voting suppression. Within days of the Supreme Court decision, six states with a history of voting suppression moved swiftly to restrict voting rights, unchecked by the preclearance process, with Florida looking to resume its voter purge.",
    " Title: Judge's Ruling on NSA Surveillance Program Delays Obama's Surveillance Reform Decision, Amplifies Calls for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a federal judge's decision on Monday questioning the constitutionality of the National Security Agency's (NSA) massive call-tracking program has delayed President Barack Obama's planned announcement of surveillance reforms, providing more time for privacy advocates to pressure the administration for meaningful changes.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon's ruling, which found the NSA's metadata program appears to violate the Fourth Amendment, was issued just three days after a review group established by Obama delivered its report proposing over 40 changes to the federal government's surveillance programs. The White House, initially expected to finalize the reform proposals before Christmas, now plans to complete the process in January.\n\nThe delay offers Leon's decision time to resonate and gives surveillance skeptics more time to pressure Obama to endorse significant reforms in light of Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA surveillance practices. The ruling also underscores the political challenges Obama faces in defending the NSA's surveillance programs while maintaining his commitment to restoring civil liberties and ending the perceived permanent war on terror.\n\nLeon's decision will not take effect while it is being appealed, and with at least three other lawsuits related to the metadata program in the works, the issue seems likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. However, politically, Leon's ruling could create the impression that Obama is less concerned about privacy rights than a conservative judge appointed by a previous administration.\n\nMichelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pressing for an end to bulk data collection and for greater safeguards on surveillance, said, \"This is going to open up a whole new point in the debate... Hopefully, this will lead to more support for meaningful changes.\" Former NSA Director Michael Hayden, a supporter of the call-tracking program, also suggested the new court ruling could shift the balance in favor of more limits on the NSA's work.\n\nObama has signaled his plans to impose greater limits on the NSA, but the specifics of those changes have yet to be finalized. Among those who might now have more influence in shaping the reforms is John Podesta, who is set to begin work as a counselor to Obama next month. Podesta, a longtime privacy advocate, has expressed support for Leon's conclusion that a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent allowing police to trace a suspected criminal's phone calls without a warrant does not authorize bulk collection of data on virtually every phone call made to, from, or within the U.S.\n\nThe White House has yet to comment on the impact of Leon's ruling, referring questions to the Justice Department, which is reviewing the decision and citing numerous orders from other judges re-authorizing the program. The controversy surrounding the metadata program remains contentious in Congress, with prospects for significant reforms uncertain. The issue has been removed from a defense bill expected to pass this week, and the controversial nature of the program, combined with support from most Republicans and some powerful Democrats, makes major reforms in the Senate challenging at best.\n\nOther events could dampen the impact of Leon's decision, such as a contrary ruling from another court considering lawsuits challenging the metadata program. However, Leon's decision has already buoyed critics of the metadata program in Congress, and it underscores the importance of external judges reviewing these programs and providing a more balanced perspective on their constitutionality.",
    " Title: GOP Reconsiders Pursuit of Clinton Email Scandal as Benghazi Committee Interrogations Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of growing Democratic accusations of overreach, particularly concerning Hillary Clinton's emails, the House Benghazi Committee is reconsidering the aggressiveness of their investigation into the email scandal that has been a persistent issue for the Democratic front-runner. The committee is also undecided about whether to call Heather Samuelson, a former Clinton campaign staffer who helped screen Clinton's State Department emails.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, GOP members of the panel were eager to question Samuelson, as panel sources claim she was the lawyer who initially chose which of Clinton's emails were work-related and thus should be turned over to the State Department, and which would ultimately be deleted. However, Republicans are now debating whether to bring her in, with a GOP source stating, \"The question becomes: Is it worth the hassle and the drama?\"\n\nThe reevaluation follows a Thursday hearing that was widely seen as a success for Clinton, while Republicans failed to strike any decisive blows. Meanwhile, Democrats have amplified their claims that the entire investigation is a partisan witch hunt.\n\nThe panel's mandate was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of four Americans outside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. However, after the revelation that Clinton used a private email server for her State Department correspondence, Republicans on the panel began probing further into whether she had turned over all relevant emails.\n\nStill, GOP leaders maintain that they've never focused directly on Clinton's email setup, which is currently being investigated by the FBI, although a fired GOP committee staffer said they zeroed in on the issue after the server was discovered.\n\nFaced with a growing barrage of Democratic accusations that they're targeting Clinton for political reasons, Republicans on the panel are downplaying the email question\u2014at least for now. After their high-profile turn in the national spotlight with Clinton's Thursday testimony, the panel is headed back behind closed doors for purely Benghazi-related interviews with officials from the White House, the Department of Defense, and the CIA, sources said.\n\nCommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has long maintained he's only interested in the emails because he wants to assemble a complete record of Clinton's communications when she ran the State Department. During their investigation, Benghazi Republicans found about 15 Clinton emails that she never turned over\u2014raising GOP suspicions that more might be missing.\n\nHowever, the email issue only came up briefly at the tail end of her marathon Benghazi hearing. And Republicans spent the bulk of their time pressing Clinton over the security failures at the Libyan diplomatic mission, and attacking her leadership of the State Department.\n\nEven Gowdy admitted Clinton's 11-hour testimony failed to produce any major new revelations. \"I don't know that she testified that much different today than she has previous times,\" he told reporters after the hearing Thursday.\n\nRepublicans say Clinton's testimony wasn't about scoring points or catching her in a \"gotcha\" moment over the Benghazi attacks\u2014or the emails issue, for that matter. They said they were aiming to piece together a larger mosaic around the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack that left four Americans dead.\n\nHowever, after a lengthy day of tense, and sometimes confrontational testimony, Democrats aren't buying it. \"I think the American people are left wondering what prompted the select committee at all; there is not a single new ray of light shed on the tragedy that took place years ago,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a telephone call with reporters Friday. \"The committee Republicans badgered Hillary Clinton at every turn, they interrupted her and threw the kitchen sink at her. But despite all of the attacks, Hillary was rock solid.\"\n\nPanel Republicans and Democrats took to the TV cameras Friday to try to spin the hearing, with the left repeating their calls for the panel to disband, and the right insisting Clinton had been evasive. The email issue is likely to remain a contentious point of contention as the investigation continues.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Engage in Damage Control and Prepare for Unemployment Report Ahead of Debate Rematch\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a heated first presidential debate, both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney are in damage-control mode, as they prepare for the next potential game-changer \u2013 the monthly unemployment report set to be released by the Labor Department on Friday. The report will provide an update on the unemployment rate, which has been slowly edging down to 8.1 percent, but has reflected weak hiring month after month.\n\nObama, who claimed during Wednesday's debate that the economy is on the rebound, needs to show some positive statistics on the board, and Friday's report is the last of two monthly snapshots before the November election. Romney, at their first debate in Denver, had criticized the president over the state of the economy and declared, \"The status quo is not going to cut it.\"\n\nFollowing the debate, the Obama campaign said it would \"make adjustments\" going forward and tried to get back on the offensive. At a Denver rally Thursday afternoon, Obama criticized Romney, stating, \"When I got onto the stage I met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney, but it couldn't have been Mitt Romney, because the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country for the last year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy.\"\n\nThe president went on to tick off a string of complaints about Romney's on-stage claims before adding, \"The man on stage last night, he does not want to be held accountable to the real Mitt Romney's decisions.\" Obama's campaign complemented the rally with a conference call in which adviser David Axelrod said Romney was \"completely untethered from the truth.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign quickly fired back, accusing Obama of doubling down on \"false attacks.\" Spokesman Ryan Williams said, \"In full damage-control mode, President Obama today offered no defense of his record and no vision for the future. Rather than a plan to fix our economy, President Obama simply offered more false attacks and renewed his call for job-killing tax hikes.\"\n\nThe explanations from the Obama campaign about what went wrong came as observers from both sides of the political spectrum roundly judged Romney the winner. The Republican nominee was quick on his feet, polished, and feisty as he repeatedly cut off the moderator and challenged his opponent on the facts.\n\nRomney is heading next to the battleground of Virginia on Thursday, while Obama is heading to Wisconsin following his rally in Colorado. It remains to be seen whether Romney's performance will move the polls, but he was clearly looking for a race-shaking performance having slipped in recent weeks in several swing-state surveys. The race could be given a jolt again on Friday with the release of the Labor Department's monthly unemployment numbers.\n\nEach candidate strived throughout the 90-minute debate to appeal to the middle-class voters who likely will decide the election five weeks from now. While Romney accused Obama of pushing \"trickle-down government,\" Obama accused Romney of wanting to \"double down on the top-down policies\" that led to the financial crisis.\n\nThe debate, which focused exclusively on domestic matters, was one of three presidential debates set for October and marked Romney's first opportunity to go toe to toe with the president. The debate was tense at times, with the candidates often cutting off the moderator, PBS's Jim Lehrer. Romney appeared to take a consistently more aggressive tone on stage, though the overall tenor of the debate marked a step back from what has become a bitter and nasty campaign in the closing weeks.\n\nEach candidate came armed with studies and stats to bolster their respective position, but the central goal was to broaden their appeal before a national audience hurting for jobs and make the case for why their plans would boost growth. Obama argued that the issue to consider is not \"where we've been\" but \"where we're going.\"\n\n\"We've begun to fight our way back,\" Obama said. He accused Romney of wanting to roll back regulations and implement tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and reverse those gains. But Romney, citing the millions who have gone on food stamps and hit the unemployment lines in the last four years, argued that \"the status quo is not going to cut it.\"\n\n\"We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path,\" Romney said. He said Obama's push to raise taxes on top earners amounts to a tax on the very small businesses needed for a robust economic recovery.\n\n\"You raise taxes and you kill jobs,\" Romney said. \"I do not want to kill jobs in this environment.\" On taxes, though, Romney sought to wipe away the caricature that the Obama campaign has been drawing these last two years \u2013 of Romney as an out-of-touch millionaire who's looking to make the rich richer with his tax cut plan.\n\nObama again argued Wednesday night that the Republican nominee is pushing a $5 trillion tax cut plan that would skew toward the wealthy. To offset that, Obama claimed, Romney would have to either add to the deficit or raise the burden on the middle class. Romney, though, insisted the 20 percent across-the-board rate cut he's pushing is not nearly as sweeping as the president describes.\n\n\"I do not have a $5 trillion tax cut,\" Romney said. Further, he pledged to hold to his promise that it would be deficit-neutral and not hurt the middle class. \"There will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,\" Romney said. He added, \"I will not under any circumstance raise taxes on middle-income families.\"\n\nRomney addressed his tax plan after saying in an interview that one way to offset the rate cut would be to cap deductions at perhaps $17,000 \u2013 and have taxpayers choose what deductions they want to take. The details may have been meant to undercut the Obama campaign's claims that he has not been specific.\n\nThe two candidates debate next on Oct. 16 and for the last time on Oct. 22. The only vice presidential debate is set for Oct. 11.",
    " Title: Illinois Cannabis Consumers and Gun Ownership: Navigating the Intersection of State and Federal Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Illinois, where recreational marijuana sales commenced this week, cannabis consumers will face higher taxes compared to consumers in most other legal states. However, they can breathe a sigh of relief as they will not face the threat of state police confiscating their firearms, thanks to protections enshrined in the 2019 Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act.\n\nHowever, a complex interplay between state and federal laws emerges when it comes to gun ownership for cannabis consumers. Under federal law, any individual who is an \"unlawful user\" of a controlled substance, including marijuana, is prohibited from possessing a firearm. This is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nMoreover, a cannabis consumer who falsely answers \"no\" to the question about illegal drug use while buying a gun is also committing a federal felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Illinois, in turn, prohibits anyone who has used an illegal drug during the past year from obtaining a Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card, a requirement for legally owning a gun in the state.\n\nHowever, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act states that cannabis consumers will not be considered \"unlawful users\" of marijuana in the state. This week, the Illinois State Police (ISP), which oversees the FOID program, confirmed that it will not revoke cards based solely on a person's legal use of adult-use cannabis.\n\nThe ISP, however, warned that it will revoke FOID cards where it is demonstrated that an individual is addicted to or is a habitual user of cannabis. It also noted that the use of cannabis is still considered illegal by the Federal government and that the purchase of a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer is governed by Federal law.\n\nThe ISP did not mention the risk of information sharing between state-licensed marijuana retailers and federal agencies, but Ed Sullivan, a former state legislator and lobbyist for the Illinois State Rifle Association, clarified that cannabis dispensaries cannot share personal information without the consumer's authorization.\n\nSullivan, however, raised concerns about the potential sharing of information of medical marijuana patients with federal agencies, as the federal government considers cannabis a Schedule I narcotic. This could potentially jeopardize a medical marijuana patient's right to purchase a firearm from a Federal Firearm License (FFL) holder.\n\nSullivan suggested that buying marijuana from recreational dealers might be a safer option for patients concerned about their Second Amendment rights. However, this might not be entirely accurate, as the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Act promises confidentiality of medical marijuana patients' information.\n\nWhile both the Illinois State Police and Sullivan focus on gun purchases from federally licensed dealers, the federal law banning firearm possession by cannabis consumers also applies to private transfers or continued gun ownership by someone who decides to try marijuana now that it's legal in Illinois. Enforcement in these contexts may be challenging, but the fact remains that millions of gun owners are considered felons in the eyes of the federal government due to their use of a legal intoxicant in states accounting for more than a quarter of the country's population.",
    " Title: Americans Divided on Climate Change, Immigration, and Health Care; Support for Hagel Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - In his second inaugural address, President Barack Obama reiterated his commitment to addressing climate change and illegal immigration, two issues that remain divisive among Americans, according to a new national survey.\n\nThe survey, conducted by CNN/ORC International, indicates that 49% of the public agrees with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars, power plants, and factories. This figure is down seven points from 2007, with 24% stating that global warming has not been proven, and 24% asserting that it is a proven fact but not due to man-made sources.\n\nThe partisan divide on the question is evident, with two-thirds of Democrats stating that global warming is man-made, compared to 48% among independent voters and 28% among Republicans.\n\nIn terms of illegal immigration, the poll shows a bare majority of 53% favoring a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents, rather than focusing on deportation. This is a shift from 2011, when a 55% - 42% majority favored deporting undocumented residents and stopping more from entering the country.\n\nThe poll also indicates a partisan and generational divide on the issue, with younger people favoring allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal, and a slight plurality of those 50 and older supporting deportation and border security.\n\nPresident Obama's domestic achievement in his first term was passing the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare.\" The poll shows that 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the law, while 44% oppose all or most of the provisions.\n\nIn the aftermath of his inauguration speech, President Obama signed documents confirming his nominations for some top Cabinet posts, including former Senator Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. Hagel's nomination has faced reservations and opposition from some senators, who question his positions on Israel, Iran, and the Iraq war.\n\nThe poll indicates that 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel, which is twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation. However, with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue, the White House might find some room for reassurance if support for Hagel were just over 50%, rather than just under that mark.\n\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on January 14-15, with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: Investigating the Alleged Surveillance of Trump Tower: A Call for a Special Prosecutor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, allegations have surfaced that the Obama administration may have spied on some of President Trump's associates during the 2016 election campaign. While the exact details of the surveillance, the extent of the information collected, and the individuals targeted remain unclear, it appears that the Obama Justice Department considered a criminal investigation of several Trump associates, which was later converted into an intelligence probe under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nAccording to former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy in National Review, elements of this story have been confirmed by The New York Times, the BBC, and McClatchy newspapers. The FISA court, which almost always grants government requests for national security surveillance, reportedly refused permission when the Justice Department asked to spy on several of Trump's associates. However, during the final weeks of the election, the Obama administration made a narrower request that did not specifically mention Trump, which was granted by the court.\n\nFormer Obama officials have issued denials, but McCarthy calls these \"disingenuous on several levels.\" The Obama administration's claim that the president did not \"order\" surveillance of Trump is questioned by McCarthy, who points out that it is technically the FISA court that \"orders\" surveillance, and by statute, it is the Justice Department, not the White House, that represents the government in FISA court proceedings.\n\nJournalist Mickey Kaus commented on Twitter that presidents name trusted allies as attorney general, and it seems unlikely that this was a rogue operation. Given the controversial nature of the surveillance request, it seems implausible that it could have happened without consultation between the Justice Department and the White House.\n\nTrump has called for a congressional investigation, but a special prosecutor, someone from outside the politically tainted Justice Department, is needed to look into the political abuse of surveillance laws by the Obama administration. If the worst suspicions are borne out, we may be dealing with something worse than Watergate.\n\nRobert Barnes, a First Amendment attorney, notes that if those limits were exceeded, if Obama officials lied to the court, or if the information was shared excessively within the government or leaked to outsiders, those are all serious crimes. If an investigation reveals political abuses of the Justice Department and the intelligence surveillance process, those guilty should not simply be exposed but go to jail. Such abuse strikes at democracy itself.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors.\n\nRead diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion, and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

    " Title: Investigations Surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's Death Raise Questions on Prison Conditions and Justice System Integrity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe sudden death of Jeffrey Epstein, the accused pedophile, this morning, reportedly a suicide according to federal officials, has left many questioning the circumstances surrounding his death and the actions of the authorities involved. The fact that one of the country's highest-profile federal prisoners could commit suicide defies logic and belief, and raises doubts about the actions of the FBI, Attorney General William Barr, and other officials.\n\nEpstein's death has sparked a wave of demands for answers from members of Congress, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who are seeking clarity on the events leading up to his death. The most pressing question, however, is why Epstein was in solitary confinement in the first place, a situation that is inappropriate for a prisoner already at risk of suicide.\n\nEpstein, a billionaire financier with powerful connections in the worlds of business and politics, pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to sex crimes and served a few months in jail. He was reindicted this summer in New York on charges of sex trafficking underage girls and had been in federal custody ever since. Epstein attempted suicide less than two weeks ago and was placed in solitary confinement and under a suicide watch.\n\nThe use of solitary confinement in a penal institution is valid when a prisoner poses a threat to the institution, its staff, or is an escape risk. However, in Epstein's case, he was none of the above. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which had custody over Epstein, and federal prosecutors were aware of his earlier suicide attempt, yet they placed him in solitary confinement, enabling him to complete what he had started before.\n\nThe question of Epstein's death and the investigation surrounding him raises serious concerns about his death and the actions of the authorities involved. Placing a suicidal prisoner in solitary confinement is not only inhumane but also potentially dangerous, as it can lead to a prisoner's death. The government often uses every tool at its disposal to ensure a fair trial, but the use of psychological tools, such as solitary confinement, to force a prisoner to plead guilty or cooperate with the government is a matter of great concern.\n\nThe crime in this case is not just Epstein's death, but the fact that he was placed in solitary confinement at all. The use of solitary confinement is a mechanism to demean, degrade, and demoralize a prisoner, and it can lead to a deep depression from which some prisoners may never recover.\n\nThe events surrounding Epstein's death have raised questions about the integrity of the U.S. criminal justice system, and it is crucial that a thorough investigation is conducted to ensure that justice is served and that the system is held accountable for its actions. Only time will tell if Epstein's death was the result of a systemic failure or if something more sinister occurred.",
    " Title: Justice Department May Pursue Legal Action Against States Over Lockdown Measures, Says Attorney General Barr\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could escalate tensions between the federal and state governments, Attorney General William Barr has indicated that the Justice Department may take legal action against governors who maintain strict lockdown measures after their coronavirus outbreaks subside.\n\nBarr, who has been vocal about some lockdown measures infringing on Americans' constitutional rights, including bans on attending church and purchasing firearms, made the comments in a report by Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The Trump administration issued new guidelines last week for states to begin lifting their lockdown measures once they meet certain coronavirus milestones.\n\n\"We have to give businesses more freedom to operate in a way that\u2019s reasonably safe,\" Barr said, according to Bloomberg. \"To the extent that governors don\u2019t and impinge on either civil rights or on the national commerce \u2014 our common market that we have here \u2014 then we\u2019ll have to address that.\"\n\nThe federal government may intervene to support any lawsuits against states that the Justice Department believes are pushing lockdown limits too far. One state that is likely to fit the bill is Michigan, where hundreds have flaunted distancing guidelines to protest at the state capital, arguing Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is abusing her authority.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,\" Barr said, according to Bloomberg. \"And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file a statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\"\n\nMost states have yet to meet the Trump administration\u2019s milestones for entering phase one, which recommend that states see at least 14 days of decreasing cases of both coronavirus and flu-like symptoms; hospital workers must be fully equipped with personal protection equipment and ventilators, and there must be an adequate testing system for healthcare workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in announcing the phased reopening plan, said, \"All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. It is clear that our strategy is working, and very strongly working.\" He added, \"The data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. Hopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Promotes Jobs Plan in Baltimore, Criticizes Washington's Distractions Amidst Ongoing Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a Republican-led congressional hearing on the alleged abuse of power by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), President Barack Obama visited Baltimore on Friday to promote his jobs plan and emphasize the need for lawmakers to focus on issues that matter to the middle class.\n\nDuring a tour of Ellicott Dredges, a manufacturing company that produces dredging equipment, the President commended Democratic lawmakers from Maryland for their efforts in supporting programs aimed at helping the middle class. While he did not directly address the ongoing scandals plaguing his administration, he expressed frustration with the tendency of Washington to be sidetracked by partisan politics.\n\n\"I know it can seem frustrating sometimes when it seems like Washington's priorities aren't the same as your priorities,\" Obama told plant workers. \"I know it often seems like folks down there are more concerned with their jobs than with yours. Others may get distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by, but the middle class will always be my No.1 priority, period.\"\n\nThe visit marked the second installment of the President's \"middle-class jobs and opportunity tour,\" an initiative aimed at promoting his economic agenda. However, the President's efforts to move forward with his initiatives have been hampered as his administration grapples with a series of controversies, including the IRS scandal, the investigation into last year's terrorist attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, and a Justice Department leak probe targeting the news media.\n\nThe President emphasized the need for the country to avoid distractions and called for leaders who demonstrate \"seriousness of purpose.\"\n\n\"The only thing that's holding us back sometimes is a lack of political will,\" he said. \"Sometimes our leadership isn't focused where we need to be focused.\"\n\nThe President advocated for $50 billion in infrastructure improvements but admitted that \"we've had a little difficulty getting our Republican friends to work with us\" to approve the new spending. He announced that he is ordering the federal government to cut red tape to expedite construction projects.\n\n\"We've got to up our game when it comes to infrastructure,\" Obama said.\n\nHowever, Republicans criticized the President for his lack of action on the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that has been delayed due to environmental concerns. Peter Bowe, president of Ellicott Dredges, testified in favor of the pipeline during a congressional hearing on Thursday, stating that it would create jobs not only for the pipeline itself but also for decades to come in the production of oil from Alberta oil sands deposits.\n\nThe President did not mention the pipeline during his visit, but he praised Ellicott Dredges, the oldest dredging company in the U.S., for their expertise in growing the economy.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, criticized the President for allegedly delaying the pipeline project, stating, \"Unfortunately, this visit is just another one of President Obama's campaign-style photo ops. Instead of doing concrete work to create jobs, he's busy giving speeches and taking pictures.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Endorses Ted Cruz for Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move ahead of Wisconsin's primary, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz secured the endorsement of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on Tuesday. The endorsement comes as all five Republican candidates, including Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich, converged on Wisconsin.\n\nWalker, a two-term Republican who made history by winning a recall election in 2012, announced his support for Cruz during a conservative talk radio interview in Milwaukee. He chose Cruz over Trump and Kasich, stating that he believes Cruz is the best candidate to secure the GOP nomination and challenge presumed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nWalker's endorsement comes as Trump planned his first Wisconsin campaign stop in House Speaker Paul Ryan's hometown. After the Janesville, Wisconsin, rally, Trump was scheduled to join Kasich and Cruz for a CNN town hall in Milwaukee. In the Democratic race, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Clinton were campaigning around the state.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Walker argued that a governor should be the nominee. However, he chose to support Cruz, who until recently had not received the same level of support from the GOP establishment.\n\n\"It was an easy call for me to support Ted Cruz,\" Walker said, praising Cruz's consistency and his willingness to stand up for his constituents against Washington interests.\n\nCruz supporters reacted enthusiastically as Walker's radio interview was played live at a rally outside of Milwaukee. Trump, who had previously expressed confidence in his ability to win Wisconsin without Walker's endorsement, took to Twitter to express his disappointment.\n\n\"After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco, and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!\" Trump wrote, referring specifically to former contenders Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.\n\nIt remains unclear how much Walker's endorsement will help Cruz, who has also won the backing of influential conservative talk radio hosts in the Milwaukee market that reach into heavily Republican suburban counties. Walker's approval rating has not exceeded 40 percent in over a year.\n\nWisconsin has 42 delegates, with 18 going to the statewide winner and 24 divided up to the winner in each of the state's eight congressional districts. Kasich has expressed hope of winning in a couple of congressional districts, while Cruz and Trump compete to secure the state.\n\nKasich was campaigning for votes in suburban Milwaukee, as was Cruz, who appeared with Carly Fiorina at a morning rally. On the Democratic side, Clinton was to appear at a gun violence forum in Milwaukee and then head north to Green Bay and west to La Crosse, which is on the Minnesota border. Sanders was stopping in the Milwaukee area and Appleton.",
    " Title: Trump and Kim Agree on Nuclear Talks, Repatriation of Remains in Singapore Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic meeting between the United States and North Korea, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to engage in follow-up nuclear talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top U.S. officials \"at the earliest possible date\" and to recover and repatriate the remains of U.S. soldiers who died during the Korean War.\n\nThe joint statement, signed in Singapore, also included North Korea's commitment to \"complete denuclearization\" of the Korean Peninsula. However, the details of the denuclearization process were not specified in the document.\n\nIn a press conference after the summit, President Trump offered mixed messages about the outcome of the meeting. He described the meeting as \"the beginning of an arduous process\" and stated that Kim had taken only \"the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people.\" At the same time, he described the joint statement as \"very comprehensive\" and argued that \"I don't think you can be any more plain\" in terms of the language on denuclearization.\n\nPresident Trump maintained that while he had indeed consented to something the North Koreans have long sought\u2014a meeting between their leader and the American president\u2014he didn't view this as a concession and thought it was as beneficial to the United States as it was for North Korea. The United States hasn't given up anything of value to North Korea, he argued, while \"they have given up a tremendous amount.\"\n\nIn addition to North Korea's commitment to denuclearization and the recovery of American soldiers' remains, President Trump highlighted a number of notable gestures of goodwill that North Korea made ahead of the summit, including halting missile and nuclear tests, releasing three American hostages, and closing a nuclear-test site.\n\nHowever, President Trump also made several concessions to North Korea. He said that U.S. sanctions on North Korea would \"come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor,\" but then softened that stance by adding that \"I actually look forward to taking them off\" and that it was \"OK\" that China had recently eased up on sanctions enforcement at its border with North Korea.\n\nIn announcing that the United States and South Korea would suspend their joint military exercises as long as negotiations progress, President Trump adopted North Korea's longstanding position that these \"war games\" are \"very provocative\" rather than legitimate defensive measures. He also hinted that he might eventually fulfill the North's longtime objective of booting U.S. forces from Korea, stating, \"At some point, I want to bring our soldiers back home.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Second Thoughts on Impeachment as Senate Trial Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate prepares for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, there appears to be a growing sense of unease among Democratic leaders, with calls for new witnesses and a delay in sending the articles of impeachment from the House.\n\nLast January, Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) declared that the goal of the 2019 House Democratic Caucus was to impeach President Trump. The House impeached Trump on a straight party-line vote, with not a single Republican signing on. However, as the trial approaches, Democrats seem to be having second thoughts about their decision.\n\nMinority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called for the Senate to subpoena four new witnesses that the House never heard from. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signaled Wednesday night that she might not send over the articles of impeachment that the House had just approved.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) took to the floor both Wednesday night and Thursday morning, stating that having the Senate, which is the judge and jury of the impeachment charges, to start calling witnesses whom House prosecutors failed to pursue \"could set a nightmarish precedent.\"\n\nSchumer's plea for new witnesses is seen as an admission that the House's case for impeaching Trump is inadequate and deficient and could prove wholly non-credible to the American people. After all, if you need more witnesses, you probably do not have the smoking gun.\n\nThe message sent by Pelosi's call for more time before the trial, and Schumer's call for more witnesses, is one of fear that not only could the House's case for impeachment fail, it could be laughed out of the Senate. And the American people might be fine with that.\n\nThe Democratic Party has bet the ranch on the impeachment and removal of Trump for imperiling our \"national security.\" But are Schumer and Pelosi behaving as though the republic is in mortal peril?\n\nSchumer's call for new witnesses also underscores the thinness of Article I of the impeachment, Trump's alleged \"Abuse of Power.\" Beneath Article I, there is not a single crime listed - no treason, no bribery, no extortion, no high crimes.\n\nWhat kind of impeachment is this, with not one crime from the list the Founding Fathers designated as impeachable acts?\n\nWhy did the Democratic House not impeach Trump for conspiring with Russia to steal the 2016 election? Answer: The House could no more prove this charge than could Robert Mueller after two years.\n\nThe James Comey-FBI investigation Mueller inherited has begun to take on the aspect of a \"deep state\" conspiracy. According to the Justice Department's IG Michael Horowitz, the FISA court warrants used to justify FBI spying were the products not only of incompetence but also of mendacity and possible criminality.\n\nThe \"essential\" evidence used by the FBI to get the FISA judge to approve warrants for surveillance was the Steele dossier. An ex-British spy, Christopher Steele was working in mid-2016 for a dirt-diving operation hired by the DNC and Clinton campaign to go after Trump. His altarpiece, the dossier, we learn from Horowitz, was a farrago of fabrications, rumors, and lies fed to Steele by a Russian \"sub-source.\"\n\nIn the four FBI submissions to the FISA courts for warrants to spy on Carter Page, there were \"at least 17 significant errors or omissions.\"\n\nMoreover, the discrediting of the Comey investigation has just begun. U.S. Attorney John Durham will report this spring or summer on his deeper and wider investigation into its roots.\n\nAs IG of Justice, Horowitz's investigation was confined to his department and the FBI. But Durham is looking into the involvement of U.S. and foreign intelligence in the first days of the FBI investigation.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr and Durham have both said that they do not share Horowitz's view that there was no political bias at the beginning of the investigation of the Trump campaign. Durham's writ is far wider than Horowitz's, and he has the power to impanel grand juries and bring criminal indictments.\n\nAmong the fields Durham is plowing are reports that agents and assets of the FBI and CIA may have \"set up\" Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Possible purpose: to feed him intel about Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton, and then entrap him, put him in legal jeopardy, and turn him into an investigative instrument to be used against Trump.\n\nWith the Horowitz report confirming what the Trumpers have been reporting and saying about Comey's investigation for years, and the newly proven manipulation of the FISA courts, the media hooting about \"right-wing conspiracy theories\" seems to have been toned down.\n\nCarter Page, once considered a dupe of the Russians, is now seen as a patriot who assisted his country's intelligence services only to be made a victim of injustice who saw his civil rights be trampled upon by his own government.",
    " Title: A New Era of Change: The Resurgence of the Civil Rights Movement in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of the generation that emerged six decades ago to challenge racial injustice and build the civil rights movement, a new generation of protesters is driving change in America. This new wave of activism, reminiscent of the protests of July 16, 1960, when a group of individuals, including the author, peacefully protested segregation at the Greenville Library in South Carolina, is reshaping the American landscape.\n\nThe author, a columnist, recalls the day they and seven friends walked into the whites-only Greenville Library and were arrested for violating segregation laws. This act of defiance took place more than five years after the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which declared the \"separate but equal\" doctrine unconstitutional. However, in Greenville, South Carolina, where the author grew up, segregation persisted.\n\nPublic facilities, schools, transportation, and even cemeteries were segregated. Opportunities for education and employment were limited, with the author being unable to apply to local universities and instead attending the University of Illinois on a football scholarship.\n\nThe author's determination to challenge segregation intensified when they returned from Christmas vacation in 1959 and were unable to use the public library to complete their assignments. Protests were on the rise, with students in Nashville, Greensboro, and other cities initiating sit-ins. The July demonstration at the library marked a turning point in the author's life, as it did for many across the South.\n\nThe protesters faced fierce resistance, with accusations of being outside agitators, socialists, or communists, and violent opposition from private vigilantes and police officers. Yet, the movement persisted and eventually led to significant victories, such as the Public Accommodations Act of 1964, which ended segregated public facilities, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was propelled in part by the violent police riot on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.\n\nThe author began working with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965. The barriers that the civil rights movement struck down opened the way for a new South, attracting industries, modern companies, and professional teams. African Americans began to win elections at various levels, transforming the country.\n\nHowever, the author notes that while significant progress was made, racism persists, and institutional structures that enforce racial injustice remain. The movement for economic equality, a key focus of Dr. King's, was cut short by his assassination.\n\nNow, a new generation is emerging, driven by the tragic death of George Floyd, with demonstrations in over 2,500 places across the country. This new movement has seen unprecedented white participation, and politicians are already responding by reforming police practices, banning choke holds, and retiring symbols of racial oppression, such as the Confederate battle emblem in Mississippi.\n\nThe author concludes that this new generation of protest holds great promise for America, despite the challenges and resistance it will face. The movement is focused on reforming areas that threaten the privileged and the powerful, such as criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic economic and political rights. As the author reflects on the lessons learned 60 years ago, they emphasize that when people move, change is possible. This is a time for anyone with a conscience and a pulse to join this extraordinary movement.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Lifting Ban on Federal Research into Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards addressing gun violence in America, President Obama has proposed lifting a 15-year ban on federal research into the causes and prevention of gun-related violence. This initiative, part of a broader gun control plan, aims to end a long-standing prohibition that has restricted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies from conducting such research.\n\nFor nearly two decades, some members of Congress have impeded the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control from investigating gun violence due to concerns about perceived pro-gun control bias. In 1996, Congress diverted the $2.6 million the center had spent on gun research the previous year to brain-injury research and added language to the CDC appropriation prohibiting the use of funds for gun control advocacy.\n\nThis language, which has since been extended to the Department of Health and Human Services, has led to a lack of comprehensive, timely, and accurate data on firearm-related violence. According to a December Journal of the American Medical Association article, this has resulted in the CDC's website lacking specific links to information about preventing firearm-related violence.\n\nPresident Obama, in his address on Wednesday, vowed to end this \"freeze\" on gun-violence research. He issued a presidential memorandum directing the CDC and other US scientific agencies to conduct research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. The CDC will begin by assessing existing strategies for gun violence and identifying the most pressing research questions with the greatest potential public health impact.\n\nIn addition to this move, Obama called on Congress to appropriate $10 million to the CDC for further work, including an effort to better understand the relationship between video games, media images, and violence. He also asked for an additional $20 million to expand the National Violent Death Reporting System, which collects anonymous data on the nature of firearms used in murders or suicides, to all 50 states from its current 18.\n\nWhile the president's call for the CDC to delve into research is a legal analysis that it is permissible for them to do so under current law, it remains to be seen how eagerly the CDC will take up the banner, and whether pro-gun groups will file suit to try and stop it. As to his calls for Congress to direct more cash to this area, the success of these requests is uncertain, as it is possible that members will see this as a less controversial alternative to more sweeping measures such as the proposed assault-weapons ban. The current tight fiscal environment may also allow Capitol Hill to shuffle the suggestions aside.",
    " Title: Climate Activists Disrupt Annual Harvard-Yale Football Game, Call for Fossil Fuel Divestment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, climate change activists from both Harvard and Yale universities disrupted the annual Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday, delaying the game for nearly an hour during halftime. The protesters, who numbered around 150, unfurled banners with slogans such as \"Nobody wins. Yale and Harvard are complicit in climate injustice,\" and called on the universities to divest their multi-million dollar endowments from fossil fuel companies and companies that hold Puerto Rican debt.\n\nClad in winter coats and hats, the protesters sprawled around the 50-yard line at Yale Bowl. Loudspeaker announcements and police demands for the protesters to leave the field were met with clapping and chanting from the activists, who were urging for \"disclose, divest and reinvest.\" Organizers say several hundred more fans left their seats in the stands to join in. By the time play resumed, several dozen people had been issued misdemeanor summonses for disorderly conduct.\n\nHarvard senior Caleb Schwartz, one of the protest organizers who was arrested on Saturday, told NPR the mood on the field was joyful despite the possibility of arrest. \"That moment, when we saw people running onto the field, was just really incredible,\" he said. \"I saw organizers around me crying because it was such a beautiful moment.\"\n\nSchwartz explained that the Harvard-Yale rivalry game has been played since 1875, and organizers knew alumni from all over the world would be tuning in. \"Although it was disruptive and some people were not too happy we were on the field, it was really important because our universities are just not listening to our voices and our generation's calls for urgent climate action,\" he said.\n\nIn a joint statement, the student groups behind the protest, Fossil Free Yale, the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition, and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, wrote: \"Harvard and Yale claim their goal is to create student leaders who can strive toward a more 'just, fair, and promising world' by 'improving the world today and for future generations.' Yet by continuing to invest in industries that mislead the public, smear academics, and deny reality, Harvard and Yale are complicit in tearing down that future.\"\n\nHarvard and Yale are not the first universities to face criticism over fossil fuel investments. The first campus divestment movements started at Swarthmore College in 2011. Harvard has repeatedly said it would not pursue divestment, while Yale has made some moves in recent years to consider climate change in its investment decisions.\n\nKaren N. Peart, director of University Media Relations at Yale, told NPR in a statement: \"Yale stands firmly for the right to free expression. Today, students from Harvard and Yale expressed their views and delayed the start of the second half of the football game. We stand with the Ivy League in its statement that it is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities.\"\n\nThe protest during a marquee rivalry football game attracted widespread attention, including tweets of support from several Democratic presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. The protest garnered so much interest that Schwartz changed his bus ticket back to Cambridge on Saturday so he could stay and field the deluge of media inquiries. \"We will win this fight, and we will get the university to divest,\" he told NPR from his bus home. \"I truly don't think it's a question of if, it's a question of when. And the more pressure we can put on them, the sooner they will.\"",
    " Title: John Bolton's Controversial Foreign Policy Record Raises Concerns for Potential Secretary of State Role\n\nArticle:\n\nAs John Bolton, a staunch critic of international bureaucracy, is being considered for the role of U.S. Secretary of State under President Donald Trump, questions about his foreign policy record have come to the forefront. Bolton, who was once a recess appointment as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in 2005, has a history of advocating for regime change and controversial military interventions, which has raised concerns among experts and policymakers.\n\nBolton's tenure at the U.N. was marked by his efforts to reform the Human Rights Commission, earning him praise from the New York Times. However, his penchant for counterproductive war, particularly his support for the Iraq War and his calls for regime change in Libya and Iran, have been a source of controversy.\n\nOn the Iraq War, Bolton remains steadfast in his belief that the decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was correct. He has also criticized the notion that the removal of Saddam Hussein has led to mayhem and madness in the Middle East. However, the aftermath of the Iraq War has been marked by ongoing instability and violence, with the Islamic State (ISIS) emerging as a significant threat in the region.\n\nIn 2011, Bolton called for the assassination of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi, a move that was later criticized for contributing to the disintegration of Libya into anarchy and the rise of ISIS. On Iran, Bolton has advocated for military action to bring about regime change, a policy that experts warn could lead to a power vacuum and the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.\n\nBolton's calls for military action against Iran's nuclear program have also been met with skepticism. He has advocated for the use of conventional ordnance to render Iran's nuclear facilities inoperable, but today, all those sites are subject to daily weapons inspections, and Iran does not possess nuclear weapons.\n\nBolton's foreign policy record has also been marked by instances of inconsistency. In 2013, he opposed the Obama administration's plan to attack Syria's Bashar al-Assad, but later wrote that conditions were optimal for overthrowing Assad in 2003, a move that would have opened the Syrian front to jihadists and saddled the U.S. with the rebuilding of two nations.\n\nJohn Bolton's foreign policy record raises concerns about his ability to plan for the day after a military intervention and his tendency to advocate for regime change without considering the potential consequences. If Trump puts him at the State Department, it is the rest of us who will end up with his tab.",
    " Title: Obamacare's Impact on American Labor Force and Medicaid Prioritization\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent job growth figures for January have sparked concerns as the U.S. economy appears to be slowing down, with only 113,000 jobs added last month. This comes as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report suggesting that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is discouraging Americans from participating in the workforce.\n\nThe CBO report indicates that the health care law will result in a reduction of the labor supply equivalent to 2.3 million full-time workers. This figure is a significant increase from the initial estimate of 800,000 three years ago.\n\nMoreover, the CBO concluded that the law's expanded Medicaid eligibility would, on balance, reduce incentives to work. This means that Obamacare is potentially giving low-income Americans fewer reasons to work, which could lead to increased inequality rather than the intended decrease.\n\nThe president has often spoken about addressing inequality, but the health care law seems to be moving in the opposite direction. The Medicaid expansion prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities, a fact that is often overlooked in the rush to expand government-funded health coverage.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2012, over half a million seniors and people with disabilities were awaiting access to home and community-based services. These services could help keep individuals with disabilities out of institutions, which are often more costly.\n\nHowever, Obamacare provides states with a greater federal Medicaid match to cover previously ineligible low-income individuals. The Urban Institute reports that nearly five in six adults to be covered under the Medicaid expansion are adults without children, most in their prime working years.\n\nThis suggests that Obamacare's incentive structure places a greater emphasis on expanding coverage to these able-bodied adults, who could potentially be working or preparing for work, than helping the individuals with disabilities that Medicaid was initially created to serve.\n\nThis prioritization is not only inefficient but also uncompassionate, as it overlooks the needs of those who require immediate care and support. As the administration and its supporters push for the expansion of Medicaid, it is crucial to consider the impact on both the labor force and the individuals with disabilities who are waiting for care.",
    " Title: Democrats Launch Campaign to Pressure Republicans Over Expired Unemployment Benefits\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the final payments from the expired unemployment benefits program are distributed, Democrats have initiated a campaign to pressure Republicans, particularly those in leadership and swing districts, for allowing the program to lapse during the holiday season.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California expressed her dismay, stating, \"I don't know if our colleagues who have opposed passing the unemployment-insurance legislation know or care about the impact on families. The impact is very, very strong. It hurts the dignity of a family, of a worker.\"\n\nIn response, a liberal group, Americans United for Change, has launched a cable television advertisement, stating, \"You know who had a Merry Christmas?

    " Title: California Imposes Historic Water Cutbacks on Senior Water Rights Holders Amid Ongoing Drought\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the State of California has announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers, a decision that could challenge the agriculture industry's perceived leniency during the state's prolonged drought. The cutbacks will affect farmers who hold some of the oldest water rights, dating back over a century, for the first time in four decades.\n\nThese water rights holders, who have historically drawn water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River, and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet, will no longer be allowed to do so due to insufficient water supplies. This is not the first time during the current drought that the state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already curtailed nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them junior water rights established post-1914.\n\nFor the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell senior water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there is not enough water for them. The cutbacks announced on Friday affect rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.\n\nFurther historic cuts could be on the horizon over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board stated that it is continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be imminent for even more senior rights holders.\n\n\"Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,\" the water board said in a statement.\n\nState officials said the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order to Streamline Infrastructure Project Permitting Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to modernize the outdated environmental review and permitting process for major infrastructure projects, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on Tuesday. The order, titled \"Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects,\" aims to make the process more efficient and effective.\n\nThe current system, according to the White House, is fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable to the American people. The Federal Government lacks a system for tracking the costs of the environmental review and permitting process for major infrastructure projects. The Executive Order will require agencies to track the costs of conducting environmental reviews and making permitting decisions.\n\nMajor infrastructure projects are often held up for years due to regulatory red tape, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. It takes an average of 7 years for a complex highway project to go through the entire environmental review process, and a single agency can take 3.7 to 5 years on average to complete an environmental review, according to the National Association of Environmental Professionals. One study has found that the average delay of six years for major infrastructure projects costs the U.S. economy trillions.\n\nThe new Executive Order implements a One Federal Decision policy under which the lead Federal agency will work with other relevant Federal agencies to complete the environmental reviews and permitting decisions needed for major infrastructure projects. Each agency will sign a joint Record of Decision and all required Federal permits will be issued 90 days later. The order establishes a two-year goal to process environmental documents for major infrastructure projects.\n\nThe entire environmental review and permitting process will be reviewed to improve performance across the government and hold every Agency accountable. Under this order, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) will develop and implement an action plan to improve environmental reviews Government-wide. The CEQ will mediate disagreements between Federal agencies to prevent delays due to bureaucratic disputes.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will develop a two-year Government-wide modernization goal and ensure Federal agencies take meaningful steps to achieve it. Agencies will modify their strategic plans to include agency-specific goals for improving environmental review and permitting processes, and hold their officials accountable. OMB will establish a performance accountability system and score each agency on their implementation of the Executive Order. Poor performance will be considered in budget formulation and could result in the imposition of available penalties.\n\nAgencies will also be held accountable for implementing appropriate best practices that are proven to enhance the environmental review and permitting process. The Executive Order makes clear that environmental protections will be maintained, and that the process should focus more on decision-making and good environmental outcomes rather than bureaucratic process.\n\nPresident Trump has made infrastructure a priority and has taken action to rebuild America. The new Executive Order is a step towards achieving that goal by streamlining the permitting process for major infrastructure projects.",
    " Title: Democratic Allies Unite Forces to Counter Republican Financial Advantage in 2012 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to counter the significant financial firepower of their right-wing counterparts, Democratic-aligned super PACs and advocacy groups are increasingly joining forces for the 2012 general election. This collaborative strategy aims to bolster President Barack Obama and a select number of House and Senate candidates.\n\nFrom newly formed super PACs to unions, environmentalists, and women's groups, Democratic-aligned organizations are forming short-term partnerships to advance their most immediate goals, whether that means rallying behind a chosen candidate or targeting a shared Republican enemy. This level of cooperation between outside groups on both the left and right is more intense and urgent than in past cycles, according to operatives involved in these organizations' 2012 efforts.\n\nWhile campaigns cannot coordinate with independent spending groups, there are no rules barring cooperation between the myriad interest groups on the right and left, which often share the same political goals and compete for the same dollars. For Democrats, fundraising has been particularly challenging this cycle. They cannot compete for dominance on television and radio with the GOP groups, but Democratic organizations hope to limit their financial disadvantage in the most urgent campaigns by sharing costs.\n\nTwo recent examples of this collaboration emerged this week. Priorities USA Action and the labor giant SEIU announced they would jointly commit $4 million to Spanish-language television ads criticizing Mitt Romney as hostile to working people. Meanwhile, a coalition of five environmental groups is preparing to launch an almost two-month campaign to boost Democratic Rep. Martin Heinrich in the New Mexico Senate race. The organizations involved\u2014the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund\u2014are splitting the cost evenly, according to a strategist familiar with the campaign.\n\nEMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock stated that Democratic organizations have coordinated for years, in many cases through the coalition-building group America Votes. However, this cycle, the teamwork is closer than ever. In addition to Priorities USA Action, Democrats have formed super PACs to focus on both chambers of Congress: Majority PAC, which focuses on the Senate, and House Majority PAC. Key collaborators include SEIU, EMILY's List, LCV, and the public-sector labor group AFSCME.\n\nSchriock explained that resources are tight, and there is no room for waste or duplication of efforts due to the avalanche of Republican spending. EMILY's List will \"move money into whatever vehicle\" appears most effective in a given race, and has partnered with VoteVets.org and Majority PAC to run TV commercials for Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nFor the groups that are joining forces\u2014sometimes for a single ad campaign, sometimes over a longer period of time\u2014there may be a limit on the total size of the financial pie available. However, there are no Koch or Sheldon Adelson-level benefactors on the Democratic side\u2014that is, ideological billionaires willing to pour potentially unlimited funds into their chosen causes.",
    " Title: Surge Pricing Sparks Outrage as Uber and Lyft Caps Prices During Deadly Seattle Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a deadly shooting in downtown Seattle on Wednesday, which left a woman dead and seven others injured, riders have expressed outrage over surge pricing from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, which reportedly quadrupled during the chaotic escape from the area.\n\nComments on social media were unforgiving of both companies, with riders sharing their high charges as they fled the scene. Heather Szum tweeted that she was charged $122 to get to West Seattle, while another rider, Lisa Wilkins, shared an image of a charge over $126. A Twitter user who goes by the handle pulkit2911 noted his usual $25 to $35 ride from Seattle to Bellevue skyrocketed to $149.23.\n\nSpokespersons for both Uber and Lyft said that the surge pricing was automatically imposed due to increased demand, but both companies have since refunded customers who were affected. The companies imposed caps on the surge pricing in response to the emergency situation.\n\nAccording to police, they were called to a shooting scene at Pine Street between Third and Fourth avenues around 5 p.m. on Wednesday in response to bullets fired. One woman was shot dead, and seven men, including a 9-year-old boy, were wounded. The survivors were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and the woman's identity was to be released by the city's medical examiner's office, a police spokesman told DailyMail.com on Friday.\n\nA 21-year-old man identified as Jamel Jackson, who was among the wounded, was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, said authorities, who were still on the hunt for two more suspects, identified as William Ray Toliver and Marquise Tolbert, 24.\n\nThe shooting scene was at the same intersection that is home to BlueShift, Amazon's office building, where two company employees were among the wounded. Both were standing outside when the gunfire erupted, according to KCPQ-TV.\n\nWhile people who complained about the spike in surge pricing on social media, there were others who also noted when it was capped. Uber's website includes a page entitled 'Looking out for the Uber Community During an Emergency,' written by the company's global head of physical security. The page notes that the company has a 'Global Security Center' that monitors and flags 'issues that may affect our business and the communities in which we operate\u201424 hours a day, 7 days a week,' and that pricing is capped when a'major emergency event may have occurred.'\n\nLyft issued a statement to DailyMail.com, calling the shooting 'tragic.' 'Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,' the company said.",
    " Title: Clinton Accuses Benghazi Committee of Being Political Hit Job Aimed at Her\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange at a forum in New Hampshire on Monday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced the House Select Committee on Benghazi, citing controversial remarks by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that she claimed proved the panel was a political hit job aimed solely at her.\n\nClinton, who is set to testify before the committee later this month, stopped short of calling for the committee's disbandment, stating that such a decision was up to Congress.\n\n\"Now that they have admitted that it is a political partisan committee for the sole purpose of going after me, not trying to make our diplomats who serve in dangerous areas safer, that's up to the Congress,\" Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at the forum, which was hosted by NBC's \"Today.\"\n\nThe Clinton email controversy, in which she used a private email account to conduct official business as secretary of state, has been a key focus of the committee's investigation into the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe Republican-led probe has come under fire from Democrats following McCarthy's remarks last week, in which he stated that the committee's work was responsible for Clinton's declining poll numbers in the presidential race.\n\n\"This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. I would never have done that. And if I were president and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down,\" Clinton said.\n\nIn a preview of her upcoming testimony, Clinton emphasized her close relationship with Stevens and stated that she would never use the deaths of Americans to attack her political opponents.\n\n\"I would never have done that,\" an indignant Clinton said. \"Look at the situation they chose to exploit to go after me for political reasons: The death of four Americans in Benghazi. I knew the ambassador. I identified [his body]. I asked him to go there. I asked the president to nominate him.\"\n\nClinton expressed eagerness to testify and answer questions on her own terms, provided the committee is not shut down before her scheduled appearance on Oct. 22.\n\n\"I'll be there, and I'm looking forward to answering questions about real things when I'm there, and I'm looking forward to having a chance to explain everything we've done, everything I asked to happen,\" she said. \"But it is not appropriate what they have done from obviously their own admission.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Denial of Review Does Not Establish Constitutional Right for Same-Sex Marriage, but Consequences May Align with Same-Sex Marriage Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday declined to rule definitively on the question of a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, but the legal landscape for same-sex marriage is shifting in favor of these couples. The court's decision not to review state-enacted bans on same-sex marriage in five states effectively wipes these bans off the books, allowing same-sex couples in these states to marry immediately.\n\nIn the five states, couples could begin marrying regardless of gender as of today, and some did so immediately. In six other states that had banned the practice, further legal proceedings may be needed to apply the rulings of the relevant federal circuit courts of appeal. However, these six states are connected to the five through the federal circuit system, and the same judgment will apply.\n\nThe denial of review by the Supreme Court brings the number of states where gay marriage has been legalized, either by the state itself or through these federal cases, to 30. These states are home to the vast majority of the national population.\n\nWhile there are still ways for the Supreme Court to reassert itself in this debate, many legal experts perceive both a trend in the federal system and a signal from the nine justices who sit at its zenith. Amy Howe, the editor of the highly regarded SCOTUSBlog, told NPR's Nina Totenberg that the justices \"are very smart people\" and added, \"I don't think they're going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle.\"\n\nThe genie got out back in June 2013, when the court decided Windsor v. United States, throwing out the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). By smacking down this pivotal federal statute, the court threw wide the gates for other challenges to state laws barring gay marriage or otherwise treating gays differently.\n\nNow, as those challenges come in waves, the federal courts at all levels are applying the reasoning from Windsor with great consistency. If the high court wanted to use that as an occasion to declare a constitutional right, it could have taken one or more of the cases it denied today. However, opponents of gay marriage had hoped the court would take such a case for precisely the opposite reason\u2014to uphold the states' right to ban gay marriage.\n\nInstead, Howe observes, the justices instructed their confreres at lower levels of the pyramid to \"keep on doing what you're doing.\" In other words, there is not a clear majority of the nine to settle the matter with a landmark ruling one way or the other. They could choose to re-enter the fray at some later point, perhaps when another circuit court of appeals weighs in with a ruling that supports the state's right to ban gay marriage. That would at least create a conflict for the Supreme Court to resolve. Or it could revisit the issue later, perhaps when a clear majority has formed either to prohibit gay marriage or to permit it. That might require waiting until Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on such issues, declares himself, or it could await the next retirement of a sitting justice and the confirmation of a successor.\n\nHowever, as the number of legal gay marriages skyrockets, and the practice becomes both legal and common across most of the states and most of the population, a future court is less and less likely to rescind it.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Orders to Streamline Federal Employee Dismissal Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is likely to stir controversy, President Donald Trump has signed three executive orders on Friday aimed at expediting the process of dismissing federal employees. The orders, announced by White House officials in a call with reporters, are expected to save taxpayers an estimated $100 million per year.\n\nThe changes, according to the officials, will prioritize performance over seniority in federal agencies. This shift is expected to be met with concern among long-term federal employees, as public sector unions have traditionally advocated for merit-based rules to be kept at bay.\n\nUnion officials and experts have labeled the move as an attempt to weaken the power of federal employees' unions, which protect federal workers from unfair terminations and employment practices. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union representing 700,000 government workers, issued a statement calling the move an \"assault on public servants.\"\n\nThe term \"public servant\" has been a subject of criticism in previous discussions, with the notion that people should not be immune from dismissal for poor performance being a contentious issue. The taxpayers, who foot the bill for public sector employment, are often left to question the value of maintaining underperforming employees.\n\nIn the past, the power of public sector unions, particularly in deep-blue states, has been so significant that even egregious offenses often go unpunished. A notable example is the Los Angeles Unified School District's decision to pay off a teacher who was found to have been feeding semen to his students, rather than face the cost of termination.\n\nAs a general rule, anything that public sector unions oppose is likely to be beneficial for the public and their tax bill. President Trump's focus on results, rather than maintaining the approval of those who already oppose him, is a departure from the typical approach of many modern Republican politicians.\n\nWhile some may view this as a scorched-earth approach by the president, it may ultimately prove to be a shrewd re-election strategy. By addressing long-standing issues and prioritizing efficiency, Trump is demonstrating a commitment to accountability and fiscal responsibility, which could resonate with voters.",
    " Title: House Approves Short-Term Spending Bill, Sending Budgetary Dispute to Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a short-term spending bill that would fund domestic programs through March 23, while providing the Department of Defense with a full-year budget of $659 billion. The measure, which passed in a 245-to-182 vote that largely followed party lines, now moves to the Senate, where Democrats are expected to amend the legislation and send it back to the House for another round of voting.\n\nThe legislative back-and-forth comes as Senate leaders indicated they were nearing a sweeping two-year budget agreement that could resolve the spending stalemate that has gripped Washington for four months. However, the broader deal is not finalized, and lawmakers are racing against a midnight Thursday deadline, when current government funding is set to expire.\n\nThe House-passed bill would grant the Department of Defense a $52 billion funding boost over 2017 levels, while keeping most other government programs flat-funded for another six weeks. House Republicans argue that the spending bill will provide much-needed certainty to U.S. military planners who have expressed frustration with Congress' inability to pass a long-term spending bill.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, contend that the GOP proposal is an attempt to slash funding for education, infrastructure, and other domestic priorities. \"Instead of working constructively with Democrats to meet the needs of the American people, Republicans are trying to starve the domestic budget,\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said during Tuesday's debate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday they were working on a deal that would lift the tight budget caps that limit how much Congress can provide for defense and non-defense domestic programs alike. The budget caps were set in 2011 as part of an effort to reduce the deficit, but lawmakers have never adhered to those spending limits.\n\nWhile the Senate leaders declined to offer specifics on their possible budget deal, Schumer and other Senate Democrats said the agreement would include increased spending for at least three domestic priorities: infrastructure, veterans' health care, and combating the opioid epidemic.\n\nIf congressional leaders do reach a broad budget deal, it would allow lawmakers to write a long-term government spending bill and end the fiscal brinksmanship that has led to the passage of one short-term funding bill after another. The federal government is currently operating on its fourth short-term funding bill for the fiscal year that began on October 1, 2017, and it expires Thursday at midnight. If lawmakers don't reach an agreement before then, it would trigger another partial government shutdown, following last month's three-day closure.\n\nThe House-passed bill is designed to satisfy hardline conservatives who are demanding a significant increase in defense funding. Conservatives do not support a similar increase in domestic funding, and this has been at the heart of the budgetary impasse.\n\nIn the House, Democrats also want to address the status of DREAMers, the undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. President Trump plans to end an Obama-era program that shields those immigrants from deportation next month, leaving them in limbo. He has challenged Congress to come up with a legislative solution for immigration and said Tuesday, \"I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this taken care of.\"\n\nWith Democrats planning to leave Washington for their annual retreat on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Democratic caucus said lawmakers would hold their meetings at the Capitol instead \"given the pressing issues Congress will likely vote on over the next three days.\"",
    " Title: Student Loan Interest Rates Set to Double as Congress Fails to Reach Bipartisan Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nInterest rates on federally subsidized student loans are set to double on July 1, 2013, after lawmakers failed to find a bipartisan solution to keep the rates low. The Senate adjourned Thursday night for the July 4 recess without approving a student loan rate package.\n\nThe current 3.4 percent interest rate on Stafford loans, the most popular funding for college students, is set to expire on July 1. Without new legislation, either to extend the cap, set a new one, or find another way to peg the loans, the interest rate will rise to 6.8 percent. Congress could still forge a solution in the following days, even lowering rates retroactively.\n\nThe higher rates would add about $3,000 to the total interest on a $23,000 student loan repaid over 10 years. \"At one level, it's modest, but if you have an entry-level position or can't find work, it starts to add up,\" Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council of Education, told FoxNews.com.\n\nDemocrats have sought to keep interest on Stafford loans low, saying poor and middle-class students need the help to get college educations. Republicans, seeking to cut or at least control spending, have proposed linking student loans to the financial markets instead of letting Congress set federal lending rates. President Obama included a variation of that market-based approach in the budget he sent to Congress earlier this year, leaving his fellow Democrats trying to block his efforts.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \"Why Senate Democrats continue to attack the president's plan is a mystery to me, but I hope he's able to persuade them to join our bipartisan effort to assist students.\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the plan to tie rates to the 10-year treasury note yield could never pass and that he couldn't back something that doesn't include stronger protections for students and parents.\n\nDemocrats said the Senate would vote on July 10 on a one-year extension of the current interest rates. However, once rates rise, some experts fear generating votes to rein them back in could prove difficult. \"The sense of urgency could be lost,\" Hartle said, \"And that means interest rates will [stay] higher.\"\n\nFew students are expected to sign loan documents in July and instead were looking to finalize the aid packages closer to returning to campus in the fall. \"Federal loans are still one of the best options,\" Hartle said, \"But we could see students that are a little pinched by these rates.\"",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Admit to Artificially Fabricated Debt Crisis: A Shift Towards Pragmatic Policies?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan have admitted on national television that the debt crisis, which has been the center of political battles and fiscal cliffs, is not an immediate crisis but rather artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians.\n\nDuring interviews on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" respectively, both Boehner and Ryan acknowledged that the United States does not face an immediate debt crisis. This admission aligns with President Obama's previous acknowledgment of the demonstrable reality.\n\nThe significance of this admission goes beyond the politics of a Republican House speaker agreeing with a Democratic president. It reveals a larger truth: the GOP's fiscal alarmism is not a natural reaction to reality but a calculated means to other ideological ends.\n\nBefore delving into those ends, it is essential to remember that Boehner, like Obama, is correct on the facts. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, even if the U.S. runs deficits, federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II and will also be substantially less than, say, debt in several European countries in the mid- to late 1990s. It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position.\n\nIf we could have a sober and measured discussion about the long-term debt, pragmatic solutions could be implemented gradually, causing the least harm to the overall economy. These solutions include phasing out the Bush tax cuts, reducing defense and war spending, moving towards a single-payer healthcare system, and spending more on social programs that fight economic inequality.\n\nHowever, the national conversation about the budget is dominated by debt demagogues with ulterior motives. These alarmists have sought to create the perception of an immediate crisis to manufacture opportunities to legislate their otherwise politically impossible agenda items. This has led to calls for cuts to Social Security, even though the program has almost nothing to do with the debt crisis, and a GOP budget that targets most of its cuts at the social programs that the poor and middle-class most rely on.\n\nFrom Boehner to Ryan to the Bowles-Simpson tandem to an unending parade of television pundits, the last year has been marked by the most prominent political voices ignoring the more prudent way forward and instead claiming that these shock doctrine prescriptions\u2014i.e., Social Security/Medicare cuts, social program cuts, etc.\u2014are all required.\n\nWith Boehner and Ryan's recent admissions, the charade's most sacred lie has been exposed. In acknowledging that \"we do not have an immediate debt crisis,\" GOP leaders are admitting that there is, in fact, an alternative. They are also admitting that their longtime claims to the contrary were ends-justify-the-means tactics to manufacture an unnecessary panic\u2014one that they hoped would scare America into abruptly accepting the kind of draconian policies polls show the public opposes.\n\nNow that the truth is out, maybe a more reasoned debate can begin, and more pragmatic policies can finally take center stage.",
    " Title: Second Presidential Debate Predictions: A Tight Race Ahead for Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming presidential debate on Tuesday is expected to be a close contest, with both candidates, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, facing new challenges and expectations. This assessment should not dishearten Republicans, as it does not imply that Mitt Romney will not deliver another impressive performance. Instead, it signifies that the landscape has shifted due to the impact of the first debate, with factors now in play that are largely beyond Romney's control.\n\nThe first debate saw Romney benefit from unrealistically low expectations, a result of President Obama's campaign strategy of personal diminution and the media's readiness to echo it. This advantage has been lost, and the unrealistically high expectations that previously prevailed for Obama have also diminished. It is now clear that Obama is not the Democratic Demosthenes advertised, and he will not have to pay the price for it this time, as expectations for his performance have been lowered.\n\nMost people expect another Romney win, but it will be challenging for him to improve upon his first debate performance. Romney did all the right things during the first debate, and while he could certainly do them better, it won't be easy. One of the hardest things there is to do is exactly the same thing twice.\n\nOn the other hand, Obama will certainly improve his performance. Vice President Joe Biden demonstrated in the vice presidential debate that the Democrats are determined to be more engaged and passionate this time around, an approach that will likely appeal to Obama's base. The Democratic base will not let their guard down again, and they will not allow themselves the luxury of venting their frustration with Obama's performance, regardless of what it turns out to be.\n\nThe final reason that this debate is likely to be judged a tie is that Romney does not have to win. He has already established his credibility in the first debate, making himself appear at least the equal to Obama in the eyes of much of the broader public. This time, he does not have to extend himself to do so \u2013- he just has to be himself.\n\nThe person who has to extend himself in this debate is the president. With that greater need comes greater risk, as demonstrated during the vice presidential debate. Together, these factors suggest that the second debate is likely to be judged a tie in the media. However, Romney supporters should not be dismayed, as a tie likely will mean that their candidate has been a victim of his own success.\n\nJ.T. Young, who served in the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and as a congressional staff member, shares this perspective.",
    " Title: The Complexities of Health Disparities in Black Women: Beyond Weight and Diet\n\nArticle:\n\nBlack women face significant health challenges compared to other racial groups, with chronic cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic risk factors being more prevalent. Despite controlling for factors such as smoking, physical exercise, and diet, black women have higher rates of these conditions. This is particularly evident in their body mass index (BMI), with four out of five black women classified as either \"overweight\" or \"obese\" in the U.S.\n\nHistorically, this heightened concern about weight is rooted in racist stigmatization of black women's bodies. This stigmatization dates back nearly three centuries, with scientists arguing that African women were more likely to reach dimensions that European standards might scorn. The idea that weight is the main problem for black women builds on these historically racist ideas and overlooks the interrelated social factors that impact their health.\n\nSocial determinants, such as living in racially segregated, high-poverty areas, have been shown to be more consequential to health than BMI or health behaviors. These factors contribute to disease risk for black women, including respiratory illnesses, asthma, and lung disease, as well as serious complications from the novel coronavirus.\n\nLiving in low-income black neighborhoods often means a lack of potable water, higher levels of environmental toxins, and air pollution. These factors add to the risk for respiratory illnesses. Additionally, these neighborhoods typically have a surfeit of fast-food chains and a dearth of grocery stores offering more nutritious food choices. Food insecurity, which is defined as the lack of access to safe, affordable, and nutritious foods, has a strong association with chronic illness independent of BMI.\n\nSimply blaming black women's health conditions on \"obesity\" ignores these critically important sociohistorical factors. It also leads to a prescription long since proved to be ineffective: weight loss. Despite relentless pressure from the public health establishment, a private weight-loss industry estimated at over $72.7 billion annually in the U.S., and alarmingly high levels of body dissatisfaction, most individuals who attempt to lose weight are unable to maintain the loss over the long term and do not achieve improved health.\n\nChronic diseases such as diabetes or heart conditions are often mislabeled \"lifestyle\" diseases, when behaviors are not the central problem. Difficult life circumstances cause disease. In other words, the predominant reason black women get sick is not because they eat the wrong things but because their lives are often stressful and their neighborhoods are often polluted.\n\nThe most effective and ethical approaches for improving health should aim to change the conditions of black women's lives: tackling racism, sexism, and weightism and providing opportunities for individuals to thrive.",
    " Title: Taliban Agrees to Temporary Ceasefire in Afghanistan, Paving Way for U.S.-Taliban Peace Agreement\n\nA temporary ceasefire has been agreed upon by the Taliban's ruling council in Afghanistan, potentially paving the way for a peace agreement with the United States, according to Taliban officials. The ceasefire, which was a key demand by Washington before any peace agreement could be signed, is expected to last for 10 days, although the exact duration and start date have not been specified.\n\nThe U.S. currently has an estimated 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, and a peace deal would allow for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, marking an end to America's 18-year military engagement in the country, its longest. The U.S. wants any deal to include a promise from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not be used as a base by terrorist groups.\n\nThe Taliban chief must approve the ceasefire decision, but this is expected. The Taliban negotiating team, who met with the ruling council for a week, returned to Qatar on Sunday, where the Taliban maintain their political office and where U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been holding peace talks since September 2018.\n\nTalks were suspended in September when both sides seemed on the verge of signing a peace pact. However, a surge in violence in the capital Kabul, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier, prompted President Donald Trump to declare the deal \"dead.\" Talks resumed after Trump's surprise visit to Afghanistan at the end of November, announcing the Taliban were ready to talk and agree to a reduction in violence.\n\nKey elements of the agreement, which the U.S. and Taliban have been negotiating for over a year, include direct negotiations between Afghans on both sides of the conflict. These intra-Afghan talks are expected to be held within two weeks of the signing of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal. They will decide what a post-war Afghanistan will look like.\n\nThe first item on the agenda is expected to address how to implement a ceasefire between the Taliban and Afghanistan's National Security Forces. The negotiations, however, are expected to be prickly and will cover a variety of thorny issues, including rights of women, free speech, and changes to the country's constitution.\n\nThe intra-Afghan talks would also lay out the fate of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and the heavily armed militias belonging to Afghanistan's warlords. These warlords have amassed wealth and power since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by the U.S.-led coalition. They were removed after Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. The Taliban had harbored bin Laden, although there was no indication they were aware of al-Qaida's plans to attack the United States.\n\nEven as the Taliban were talking about ceasing hostilities, insurgents carried out an attack in northern Afghanistan on Sunday that killed at least 17 local militiamen. The attack apparently targeted a local militia commander who escaped unharmed. Local Afghan militias commonly operate in remote areas, and are under the command of either the defense or interior ministries.\n\nLast week, a U.S. soldier was killed in combat in the northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind a fatal roadside bombing that targeted American and Afghan forces in Kunduz. The U.S. military said the soldier was not killed in an IED attack but died seizing a Taliban weapons cache.\n\nThe U.S. military, in its daily report of military activity, said airstrikes overnight Sunday killed 13 Taliban in attacks throughout the country. Taliban as well as Afghan National Security Forces aided by U.S. air power have carried out daily attacks against each other. The Taliban frequently target Afghan and U.S. forces, as well as government officials. However, scores of Afghan civilians are also killed in the crossfire or by roadside bombs planted by militants. The United Nations has called on all sides in the conflict to reduce civilian casualties. The world body said increased U.S. airstrikes and ground operations by Afghan National Security Forces, as well as relentless Taliban attacks, have contributed to an increase in civilian casualties.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Overestimate Number of Americans Fighting for ISIS, Says Expert\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent Pew Research poll found that two-thirds of Americans consider the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) a \"major threat\" to the United States. However, a new analysis by Peter Bergen, a national security analyst, suggests that such fears may be unjustified.\n\nBergen, a counterterrorism expert and director of the National Security Studies program at the New America Foundation, argues that U.S. officials have been inflating the numbers of Americans fighting for ISIS. According to Bergen, the claim by U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel that there are over 100 U.S. citizens fighting in the Middle East with ISIS forces is an overestimate.\n\nHagel's comment is the latest in a series of inflated claims regarding the number of Americans fighting with ISIS. Last week, the Washington Times cited anonymous official sources who said there are 300 Americans fighting with ISIS, despite the Pentagon estimating the figure to be more like a dozen.\n\nBergen points to the example of Somalia to illustrate the potential consequences of such inflated claims. In 2006, the Ethiopian army invaded Somalia, and a sizeable group of Americans traveled to fight with the al-Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab. However, none of the 29 Americans who traveled to fight with Al-Shabaab subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the United States.\n\nIndeed, for more than a third of the American militants who fought with Al-Shabaab, going to Somalia was a one-way ticket. Several American militants died while conducting suicide attacks in Somalia, and at least two Americans fighting for Al-Shabaab were arrested, four when they returned to the West and two in East Africa.\n\nBergen's analysis suggests that the threat posed by Americans fighting in Syria may be overstated. While the CIA and FBI need to pay attention to the potential threat posed by American foreign fighters in Syria, this is no reason for U.S. officials to overhype the threat posed by ISIS to the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, while Americans should always be mindful of the threats posed by extremist groups, the case of U.S. citizens in Somalia suggests that Syria could very well end up being a graveyard for Americans fighting there rather than a launch pad for attacks on the United States.",
    " Title: The Role of Sexism in Hillary Clinton's Presidential Loss: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, the debate over the role of sexism in Hillary Clinton's loss has been a contentious one. Immediately following her defeat to Donald Trump, cries of \"sexism\" echoed across the nation, with many attributing Clinton's loss to the alleged \"misogyny\" that allegedly doomed her from the start.\n\nOn Twitter, under the top-trending hashtag #NotMyPresident, many Americans lamented the \"sexism\" that they believed had hindered Clinton's campaign. MSNBC's Jonathan Alter wrote on election night, \"Trump didn't win because of Comey, he won because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.\"\n\nVice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine introduced Clinton before her concession speech, acknowledging that she had \"made history in a nation that is good at so many things, but has made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected.\" Charlotte Alter wrote at Time, arguing that Clinton's loss \"may be as good a sign as any that we're not ready for glass-breaking yet.\"\n\nHowever, the attribution of Clinton's loss to sexism has been met with skepticism by many, including this author. Democrats would prefer that we believe otherwise, with President Obama and Bill Clinton both bemoaning the nation's latent misogyny during the campaign. On election night, Bill Clinton stated, \"I know there's a bunch of guys that are upset about having a woman president. They just don't want to 'fess up to it.\"\n\nThroughout the campaign, Clinton played the \"woman card\" to the hilt, often literally, dispensing tongue-in-cheek \"woman cards\" to fans, friends, and supporters. On election night, the Clinton camp chose the Javits Center, a \"unglamorous glass fortress on Manhattan's West Side,\" as the location for Clinton to declare victory under a literal glass ceiling.\n\nWhile sexism certainly exists, it is important to consider the many reasons for Clinton's loss, including obvious corruption, lockstep leftism, disastrous health-care prescriptions, abortion fanaticism, and basic incompetence. The \"glass ceiling\" remains unbroken when it comes to the American presidency, and it is crucial to examine the myriad factors that contributed to Clinton's defeat, rather than attributing it solely to sexism.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the campaign came in a September 22 video address Clinton gave to the Laborers' International Union of North America. After bashing right-to-work measures allowing freedom from unions, Clinton became visibly agitated. \"Now, having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?\" she bellowed, head bobbing, appearing as though she wanted to throttle the entire world. This moment, which eerily resembled a famous scene from the movie Office Space, went viral and highlighted Clinton's struggles to connect with voters.\n\nIn conclusion, while sexism certainly exists, it is important to consider the many reasons for Hillary Clinton's loss, including her own flaws and the flaws of her campaign. The \"glass ceiling\" remains unbroken, and it is crucial to examine the myriad factors that contributed to Clinton's defeat, rather than attributing it solely to sexism.",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price Assures No Financial Harm from Obamacare Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price asserted that no American will face financial disadvantage as a result of the proposed Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nDuring the interview, Price stated, \"I firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we\u2019re going through, understanding that they\u2019ll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not [that] the government forces them to buy.\"\n\nThe Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was unveiled in the House last week, but has faced opposition from both moderate and far-right lawmakers, as well as conservative groups. The plan, formally known as the American Health Care Act, has progressed through key committees and is expected to be signed into law before Congress recesses for Easter.\n\nPrice criticized Obamacare as a \"system that works for government or insurance\" but not the American people. He emphasized the need for a system that works for the people, stating, \"We need a system that works for people. I believe, and the president believes firmly, that if you create a system that\u2019s accessible for everybody and you provide the financial feasibility for everybody to get coverage, that we have a great opportunity to increase coverage over where we are right now, as opposed to where the line is going right now where people are losing coverage and we\u2019re going to have fewer individuals covered than we do currently.\""
