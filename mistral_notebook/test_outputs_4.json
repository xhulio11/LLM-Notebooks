    " Title: Federal Judge Orders Hillary Clinton to Answer Written Questions Regarding Email Server Use\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has ruled that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton must answer written questions from the conservative legal group Judicial Watch regarding her use of a private email server while in office. The group had sought Clinton to testify under oath as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit it is pursuing against the State Department.\n\nJudge Emmet Sullivan wrote that Judicial Watch has failed to demonstrate that it cannot obtain the discovery it seeks through other, less burdensome or intrusive means such as interrogatories. He gave the group until Oct. 14 to provide Clinton the questions, and she has 30 days to answer them.\n\n\"We will move quickly to get these answers,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton wrote in a statement. \"The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.\"\n\nLast month, after completing his investigation of Clinton's private server, FBI Director James Comey recommended no charges against Clinton for mishandling classified information, even as he reprimanded her for being \"extremely careless\" in using a private server.\n\nJudicial Watch, which has pursued Clinton and her husband in court for years, insists she has never answered why a private server was used in the first place.\n\nLast week, Judicial Watch released 44 previously undisclosed Clinton email exchanges that she failed to include among 30,000 private messages she turned over to the government last year. They cover Clinton's first three months as secretary of state in early 2009, a period for which Clinton did not turn over any emails to the State Department last year. The government found the newly disclosed messages during a search of agency computer files from her top aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nWhile Judicial Watch argued that only Clinton could testify about the reasons behind her decision to set up a private server, the judge said it is possible for Clinton to offer her \"unique, first-hand knowledge\" of the basis for the server in writing.\n\n\"Judicial Watch's argument that a deposition is preferable in this case because of the ability to ask follow-up questions is not persuasive,\" the judge wrote. \"Given the extensive public record related to the clintonemail.com system, a record which Judicial Watch has acknowledged, Judicial Watch will be able to anticipate many follow-up questions.\"",
    " Title: Vatican-Reviewed Journal Criticizes Evangelical and Catholic Allies of President Trump for Pursuing \"Theocratic\" Worldview and \"Apocalyptic Geopolitics\"\n\nAn article published in the Vatican-reviewed journal La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica this week has criticized evangelical and Catholic allies of President Donald Trump for promoting a \"theocratic\" worldview and engaging in \"apocalyptic geopolitics.\" The article, penned by two confidants of Pope Francis, accused these voters of coming together over a \"xenophobic and Islamophobic vision that wants walls and purifying deportations.\"\n\nThe authors of the article, who are close to Pope Francis, argue that the \"panorama of threats to their understanding of the American way of life\" has included various movements, such as modernism, the civil rights movement, the hippy movement, communism, and feminism, among others. They write, \"And now in our day there are the migrants and the Muslims.\"\n\nThe article specifically mentions Steve Bannon, Trump's top White House strategist, who the authors claim wants a country where citizens submit to the Bible, which they describe as an idea \"that is no different from the one that inspires Islamic fundamentalism.\"\n\nIn contrast, the authors praise Pope Francis for promoting a peaceful worldview, stating, \"Francis is carrying forward a systematic counter-narration with respect to the narrative of fear.\" They further commend Francis for not giving \"theological-political legitimacy to terrorists\" and for avoiding reducing Islam to Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe reference to \"barrier-fences\" seems to be a clear swipe at another Trump proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico. In May, Trump met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where he presented Francis with first-edition copies of books written by Martin Luther King Jr. In February, Francis criticized Trump, seemingly stating that Trump was not a Christian due to his stance on the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Francis said, \"To not respond to evil with evil. To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. A Christian would never say \u2018 you will pay for that. \u2019 Never,\" and added, \"That is not a Christian gesture.\"",
    " Title: Pope Francis: A Revolutionary Pope Challenging the Status Quo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the nine months since his election, Pope Francis has left an indelible mark on the Catholic Church and the world, as evidenced by his selection as Time Magazine's Person of the Year. His unconventional approach to the papacy, characterized by his humility, empathy, and focus on the poor, has captured the hearts of many and sparked controversy among others.\n\nThe pope's public gestures, such as kissing disfigured visitors, lofting newborns, and washing the feet of prisoners, may be carefully staged, but they reveal a genuine desire for the Church to serve rather than strut. His concern for the poor, a focus that stems from his Latin American roots, has been misconstrued, leading to misunderstandings about his views on capitalism and social issues.\n\nIn his first solo papal exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, Francis was widely quoted as criticizing capitalist economies. However, a closer reading reveals that his complaint is not against wealth itself, but against the pursuit of wealth as a competing religion. His comments on the American Catholic Church's obsession with issues like abortion, homosexuality, and the ordination of women priests were misinterpreted, with many assuming he was embracing these controversial topics. In reality, his stance remains unchanged, opposing these issues while emphasizing the Church's role in addressing social justice and poverty.\n\nFrancis's message challenges Catholics to live up to their potential, to be the first to help those in need, and to prioritize spiritual growth over material wealth. In Section 152 of Evangelii Gaudium, he recommended that Catholics worldwide spend more time reading the Bible. It is worth noting that Francis himself rises early to spend time in quiet, unrecorded prayer and scripture reading, drawing strength for his public persona and his challenge to tradition.\n\nThe pope's unconventional approach may embarrass some, but he offers an example of a leader who speaks to our better selves and calls us out when we fail to live up to our potential. As the world turns another page in the history of the Catholic Church, it is clear that Pope Francis is a pope who challenges the status quo and invites us all to reflect on our own lives and our role in the world.",
    " Title: U.S. Economic and Soft Power: A Shift in Focus Amidst Global Economic Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing presidential debate, the discussion on America's role in the world will encompass more than just military readiness and anti-terrorism efforts. The U.S. role in the world is multifaceted, extending beyond military might to economic power and \"soft\" power, such as the country's ability to attract and persuade others to adopt American values.\n\nThis perspective is shared by Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor, who emphasized the importance of economic and soft power in the early 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, the events of September 11, 2001, led to a renewed focus on military strength, with drones and Humvees taking precedence over the attractive powers of Hollywood movies or mobile phones.\n\nNow, with the Iraq War over and U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan winding down, Nye suggests that the focus may be shifting back to economic and cultural leadership. He notes that the Iraq War caused a significant drop in American soft power due to perceptions of U.S. aggression, while the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis impacted U.S. economic power.\n\nHowever, in the current global economic climate, with both China and Europe facing economic growth challenges, the U.S. is once again emerging as a leader in economic and soft power. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS Global Insight and author of \"Spin-Free Economics,\" agrees with Nye, stating that the U.S. still has the largest economy in the world, is the No. 1 export destination, and has innovative companies like Apple.\n\nBehravesh also points out that the U.S. dollar remains the safe haven and that U.S. college campuses are bolstering American soft power, with many Chinese leaders sending their children to study in the U.S.\n\nLooking ahead, Behravesh suggests that America's role in the world will be significantly influenced by how well Congress handles the budget deficit in the coming months. As other countries, particularly in Europe, grapple with the problem of excessive government debt, the world is looking to the U.S. for moral leadership. If the U.S. demonstrates the ability for democracies to discipline themselves and control their debts, its economic and soft power may surge.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. role in the world will be shaped by a combination of military, economic, and soft power. The handling of the budget deficit and the demonstration of democratic discipline will play a crucial role in shaping America's global influence in the 21st century.",
    " Title: RNC Chair's Remarks on Immigration Spark Controversy, Families of Victims Speak Out\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised eyebrows, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus recently urged outspoken conservatives advocating for strict immigration enforcement to tone down their rhetoric. The RNC chair's comments, made during the party's annual summer meeting in Boston, have been met with criticism and questions regarding the party's stance on immigration enforcement.\n\nAt the meeting, Priebus expressed concern that advocating for self-deportation policies during the 2016 election season was \"horrific\" and that rule-of-law rhetoric \"hurts us.\" This statement has led to questions about the acceptable discussion calendar for immigration issues within the GOP.\n\nPriebus's comments have also raised questions about his stance on the issue, as he has yet to explain what is \"horrific\" about suggesting that foreign rule-breakers should abide by our laws and return home voluntarily. This is a particularly sensitive topic, given the devastating consequences that illegal immigration can have on law-abiding citizens.\n\nThe RNC chair's comments have also been met with criticism from families who have been affected by violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants. One such family is that of Jamiel Shaw, a Los Angeles teen who was murdered by an illegal alien Mexican gang member in 2008. The killer, Pedro Espinoza, was smuggled into the U.S. illegally as a toddler, just like many of the DREAMers that open-borders advocates often champion.\n\nAfter Priebus's remarks at the GOP event, Shaw's family posed a question to the RNC chair on Twitter: \"How many Americans Have U Talked To Whose Kids were Killed by illegals?\"\n\nShaw's family has been vocal in their opposition to illegal immigration and have been advocating for the repeal of dangerous sanctuary laws, calling attention to lapses in detention and deportation policy, and opposing reckless bipartisan amnesty proposals.\n\nAs the RNC and the GOP prepare to negotiate with open-border Democrats on immigration reform, the Shaw family's activism and their call for immediate reform of the criminal alien detention and deportation system will be crucial in shaping the party's stance on the issue.\n\nThe Shaw family's story is a stark reminder of the real-world consequences of failed immigration policies and the importance of enforcing the rule of law. Their activism, while often overlooked by mainstream media and political elites, serves as a powerful testament to the lives lost and the families affected by illegal immigration.",
    " Title: CNN Analyst Phil Mudd Warns of Government Distrust Towards President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning during a Thursday interview with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, former CIA Deputy Director Phil Mudd, who also served as a deputy to former FBI Director Robert Mueller, stated that the U.S. government is showing signs of antagonism towards President Trump. Mudd, a vocal critic of the current president, declared, \"Government is going to kill this guy.\"\n\nMudd's statement was made during a segment on \"The Lead.\" He elaborated on his assertion by referring to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the FBI's July raid on the home of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\n\"What did the Department of Justice say on Paul Manafort?\" Mudd asked, emphasizing his point. \"You can say what you want, a judge told us we had cause to search his home early in the morning because we don\u2019t trust the guy who was your campaign manager.\"\n\nLeaks from both the White House and the intelligence community have been a recurring issue since President Trump took office. Last week, transcripts of Trump's phone calls with foreign leaders were leaked to The Washington Post, sparking concerns about national security.\n\n\"This is beyond the pale and will have a chilling effect going forward on the ability of the commander in chief to have candid discussions with his counterparts,\" said Ned Price, a former National Security Council official under President Obama. \"Granted, the White House contributed to this atmosphere by welcoming the free-for-all environment, where anonymous leaks are commonplace. But we must draw the line somewhere.\"\n\nMudd also pointed to Trump's recent announcement of a ban on transgender soldiers in the military as another reason for the government's growing distrust. \"We saw the same thing in his transgender comments. What is the military saying to him on transgender? 'Show us the policy.' You know what that means inside government? 'Ain\u2019t going to happen,'\" he said.\n\nThe statement by Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst, underscores the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and various government agencies.",
    " Title: Congressional Spending Bill: A Mishmash of Policy Provisions and Budgetary Allocations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avert a government shutdown, Democratic and Republican negotiators have unveiled a sprawling $1.1 trillion spending bill that includes a multitude of policy provisions and budgetary allocations. The bill, which sets the annual budgets for programs ranging from the Justice Department to NASA to the Food and Drug Administration, also serves as a vehicle for various provisions that might otherwise be vetoed.\n\nThe bill, which was unveiled late Tuesday, includes a provision that would bar the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating methane emissions from livestock production. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted by livestock in their flatulence, accounting for about 10 percent of U.S. emissions, according to the EPA. On the other hand, any poultry processed in China that might have found its way into school lunches has been banned, with the Agriculture Department barred from using it.\n\nThe bill also includes pension-related provisions sought by many unions, thanks to the efforts of retiring Rep. George Miller, a close ally of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Banks have also secured a rollback of a section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law related to derivatives trading. The defense industry has secured new funding for F-35s fighters the Pentagon didn't even ask for, while anti-environmental groups have won provisions targeting the administration's climate change policies.\n\nStates will also have the option to let schools skip out on rules requiring serving whole grains, a blow to the first lady's child nutrition efforts. The wealthy could soon be able to donate up to $777,600, from the current $97,200, to national party committees.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions that would hike the number of hours truckers can drive each week from 70 to 82, thanks to the efforts of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). Americans living abroad would get relief from new Obamacare rules on health insurance. The Boy Scouts won a special fix for their pensions.\n\nHowever, the bill's passage is not guaranteed, with some lawmakers expressing concerns about the process and the contents of the bill. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has blasted the changes to Dodd-Frank, while Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) has said he will oppose the plan in part because of changes that would allow the wealthy to donate more to political parties.\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, has said it can abide by the school-lunch changes. \"In light of the effects to roll back school nutrition standards, we consider the minor adjustments to the standards a real win for kids and parents,\" said Sam Kass, a senior adviser on nutrition, in a statement. The bill is still being scrutinized by lawmakers, K Street lobbyists, and the administration, resulting in a frantic policy scavenger hunt to discover what did and didn't make it into the bill.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Vulnerabilities in U.S. Nuclear Facility Security, Highlighting Contrasting Perspectives on Terrorist Threat\n\nA new study commissioned by the Pentagon has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the nation's nuclear facilities to terrorist attacks. The report, conducted by researchers at the University of Texas, suggests that the theft of enough nuclear material to construct an improvised fission bomb is a real possibility.\n\nThe study stands in stark contrast to the assertions made by the nuclear industry regarding the security measures in place. The Nuclear Energy Institute claims that following the events of 9/11, the industry undertook a comprehensive reassessment of its plant security and bolstered protections. According to the Institute, a typical plant features a fenced outer security perimeter, heavily patrolled; an inner double fence topped with razor wire, also heavily patrolled; and a third layer of protection surrounding vital equipment. The containment vessel itself is further protected with multiple layers of steel and concrete.\n\nHowever, the University of Texas report, citing a study by the U.S. National Laboratory in 1982, suggests that an airliner impact could breach the containment, potentially leading to a loss of coolant and a subsequent meltdown, resulting in a significant release of radiation. While the Nuclear Regulatory Commission claims its reactors can withstand such an impact, the industry reportedly lobbied against requiring such standards.\n\nProf. Alan Kuperman, one of the authors of the report, noted the wide disparity in research about the likelihood of a terrorist attack on nuclear facilities. While one expert puts the likelihood of a terrorist group acquiring a nuclear weapon at \"very substantially less than one in a million,\" another researcher estimates a 50 percent chance of a nuclear terrorist attack on U.S. soil in the next decade.\n\nThe report also highlights significant variations in the level of security at different facilities, calling for greater uniformity of security at all nuclear facilities, whether they are power plants, sites where nuclear weapons are stored, or where fissile material is stored. The study acknowledges a history of widely divergent research about the likelihood of a terrorist attack on nuclear facilities.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Express Concern Over Funding for President-elect Trump's Agenda Amidst National Debt Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the potential funding for his proposed agenda, particularly in relation to the nation's $20 trillion debt. Trump's campaign promises, which include a $1 trillion infrastructure package, $5 trillion in tax cuts, increased military spending, and the repeal of Obamacare, could add significantly to the national debt.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) voiced his concerns, stating, \"I was disappointed that it wasn't brought up in the campaign\u2014anyone's campaign really\u2014it really wasn't mentioned. So I'm very concerned about it. It's going to be tough to address if there's no push from outside of Congress.\"\n\nConservative groups share these concerns, emphasizing the importance of fiscal restraint. Michael Sargent, a research associate at The Heritage Foundation, noted, \"We did not hear anything about entitlement reform from either of the candidates, and that's a serious issue. You can't address the growth in spending without addressing entitlement issues.\"\n\nThe expected increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could further exacerbate the cost of the nation's debt. For every quarter point that interest rates rise, the federal government would have to spend an additional $50 billion annually to service the debt, according to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over infrastructure.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump's focus was on immigration, trade, and economic renewal, while his proposals regarding infrastructure, immigration reform, and campaign finance reform received less attention. Trump advisers have suggested the new administration will be able to trigger massive private sector investments in infrastructure without a huge increase in spending.\n\nHowever, in the absence of a specific plan, the overall number attached to his infrastructure plan\u2014$1 trillion\u2014has garnered attention. Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) expressed concern, stating, \"Nobody really knows the details. As we talk about them, our conference will be very concerned about how they affect both the debt and the deficit.\"\n\nSargent, of the Heritage Foundation, has seen as many as four different iterations of Trump's infrastructure plan, all of which he says would raise the deficit. \"I've seen everything ranging from direct stimulus to a $1 trillion in tax credits, both of which would obviously raise the deficit. The tax credits, he claims, would pay for themselves. I do not see that at all. The assumptions that are built into it I think are wildly optimistic,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers spent months negotiating ways to pay for a six-year, $300 billion highway bill that passed last year. The lack of concrete details and the use of \"gimmicks\" to pay for the bill has been a point of contention among conservatives.\n\nTrump could alleviate some of the concerns brewing in the Republican conference by pushing new proposals to curb spending. Already, he has modified his stance on Medicare, adopting language favored by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that Democrats are interpreting as a sign Trump will embrace Ryan's vision for a dramatic overhaul of the entitlement program.\n\nThe transition website states the incoming administration will act to \"modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges of the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation\u2014and beyond.\" In addition, many Republicans believe that repealing Obamacare will have a positive fiscal impact beyond the 10-year window scored last year by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSeveral Republicans said Trump's plan to replace Obamacare with healthcare reforms could open the door to overhauling Medicaid, which was expanded in 31 states under the healthcare law. \"One of the things Donald Trump emphasized in his campaign was the risks of a $20 trillion debt and at the same time he put forth proposals that would increase the debt by another $5 trillion,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"Some changes are definitely going to have to be made. The good news is he's shown a willingness to do that,\" she added, noting that Trump downsized his tax proposal, which initially stood at $10 trillion.\n\nBoozman expressed hope that Trump will stimulate the economy through regulatory reform, which won't add to the deficit. \"The real excitement is in the regulatory phase, getting rid of some of the unnecessary regulation that's really putting a wet blanket on the economy. That's going to save money,\" he said.",
    " Title: \"Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's Legacy: Farm Bills, School Lunch Programs, and Biofuels\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final year at the helm of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, has left a significant mark on the nation's agricultural and nutritional policies. Vilsack, who once harbored presidential aspirations, found his political journey diverted when his 2008 presidential bid faltered and he endorsed Hillary Clinton. Despite his efforts to secure Iowa for Clinton, her campaign was overshadowed by Barack Obama's Iowa juggernaut.\n\nVilsack's tenure at the USDA has been marked by several key achievements. He played a pivotal role in negotiating the 2014 farm bill, a nearly $1 trillion measure that ended four years of partisan fighting over farm subsidies and support for the food stamp program for the economically disadvantaged.\n\nAnother significant accomplishment was the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010. This legislation mandated the use of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits in schools and required that students select at least one portion of fruits or vegetables at every lunch.\n\nVilsack has also been an advocate for biofuels. This past month, he joined Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, as the guided-missile destroyer William P. Lawrence was filled with biofuel made from beef fat. Vilsack described the event as an \"extraordinary experience\" and an example of the \"series of partnerships that has extended the reach of the USDA.\"\n\nDespite his low-key, soft-spoken demeanor, Vilsack's job overseeing the nation's farmers has kept him largely out of the spotlight. However, an early low point in his career came during his second year in the job, when he reacted to a video that appeared to show racist comments from Shirley Sherrod, an Agriculture Department official in Georgia. Vilsack quickly fired her, but was later forced to publicly apologize when it was revealed that the video had been heavily edited by the operators of a conservative website. The full video showed Ms. Sherrod offering a lesson in racial tolerance and compassion.\n\nAs Vilsack prepares to step down from his position, his legacy in the agricultural and nutritional sectors remains significant, with his policies on farm subsidies, school lunches, and biofuels shaping the landscape of American agriculture and nutrition for years to come.",
    " Title: Three Rays of Hope for Bipartisanship and Compromise in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - The United States has been grappling with political division and dysfunction, leaving many Americans questioning the ability of politicians in Washington to work together. However, journalist Michael Tomasky identifies three potential developments that could lead to a reduction in polarization and cultural divisions over the next eight years.\n\nFirst, Tomasky points to the significant demographic shift in the U.S., specifically the growth of the Latino population. This demographic change is transforming the electorate in key presidential states, such as Florida, which could force the Republican Party to open itself to immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. This shift could have a moderating effect on the party, as opposition to immigration reform has been a unifying factor for the far-right.\n\nSecond, the Republican Party is at a crossroads due to Donald Trump. Regardless of the outcome of the current election, the party is deeply divided over Trump. If Trump wins, the divide will likely continue, but an anti-Trump faction could grow within the GOP, opposing the president's more extreme measures. If Clinton wins, the Republicans will have lost three elections in a row, which could lead to a reassessment of the party's stance, similar to the Democrats' move to the center after their string of losses in the 1980s.\n\nLastly, Tomasky discusses the filibuster, a Congressional rule that has been a significant source of gridlock in Congress. He suggests that the Senate may change its rules to reduce the number of votes needed to pass legislation or limit the use of the filibuster by both parties. This change could lead to more legislation being passed and senators from both parties becoming more accustomed to working together.\n\nWhile there are reasons to be skeptical about these developments, Tomasky believes there is a decent chance they will occur. He concludes by quoting C.S. Lewis, \"It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird. But it's a jolly sight harder for it to learn to fly while remaining an egg.\" The political situation may not be rosy, but Tomasky suggests that the U.S. may be on the cusp of a political hatchling that, one day, will fly again.",
    " Title: Senate Reaches Bipartisan Agreement to Avert \"Nuclear Option\" on Filibuster Rules, Allowing Confirmation of Presidential Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the United States Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on Tuesday to avoid the controversial \"nuclear option\" on filibuster rules. The agreement, brokered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has averted a potential rules change that could have significantly altered the Senate's long-standing filibuster rules.\n\nUnder the agreement, President Barack Obama will withdraw two nominees to the National Labor Relations Board, Sharon Block and Richard Griffin, and replace them with Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa. Schiffer, the associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO, and Hirozawa, the chief counsel to NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce, will be nominated to the seats on the board that expire in 2014.\n\nThe nominations are expected to move swiftly, as without the two new members, the National Labor Relations Board would cease to function in August. The agreement allows for votes on the other five nominees, including Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator and Thomas Perez as Labor secretary, to proceed. These five nominees are expected to receive confirmation votes in the next two weeks.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed his satisfaction with the agreement, stating, \"We have a new start for this body. And I feel very comfortable about it. I don't know how I could be happier.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed his approval, stating, \"It's a step in the right direction that the majority has chosen not to exercise the nuclear option. We feel good about that, I think they feel good about it, so I think that crisis has been averted.\"\n\nThe agreement allows both parties to achieve their objectives. Democrats will get seven of President Obama's nominees in place, while Republicans were able to scuttle the recess-appointed Block and Griffin from the NLRB. The agreement also allows Republicans to continue to force procedural votes on executive nominees at a 60-vote threshold, and Democrats retain the right to change the rules if necessary.\n\nThe agreement was facilitated by the efforts of Senators John McCain and Roger Wicker, who were central in crafting the deal. According to sources, Republicans have agreed not to filibuster the two NLRB nominees. The agreement was reached after intense negotiations over the weekend and into Monday night, with both leaders speaking repeatedly throughout the process.\n\nIn the Senate Democratic caucus after the agreement was reached, Sen. Barbara Mikulski told Democrats not to celebrate too much, stating, \"No gloating, maximum dignity.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer stated that the nominations would have to go through the committee process but must be in place by the end of August, when the National Labor Relations Board will cease to function without Senate action.",
    " Title: The Resurgence of the Equal Rights Amendment: A Look at the Controversial Proposal and Its Potential Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States steps into a new decade, a contentious debate surrounding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has resurfaced, with progressives aiming to ratify the amendment, a move that could potentially enshrine left-leaning gender ideologies into the U.S. Constitution. This year, Virginia is expected to ratify the ERA, bringing the total number of states to have done so since its heyday in the 1970s to 38, the threshold needed for amending the Constitution.\n\nThe proposed amendment's language appears unobjectionable: \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\" However, the amendment's broad language could potentially open the door to various constitutional claims that many Americans may reject.\n\nWhile American women are living in the freest and most prosperous times in human history, the Constitution already protects their right to speak, worship, vote, bear arms, and more. Women are also the majority of voters in nearly every election, and they own the majority of wealth in the country, along with earning the lion's share of higher degrees.\n\nThe ERA will not add to the existing protections against sex discrimination, but it could potentially be used to impose sex-sameness. For instance, it could be used to force women into combat, disallow separate-sex bathrooms, or even pull government funding from women's shelters. In some states, state-level ERAs have been interpreted as requiring government funding for abortion.\n\nThe ERA could also threaten laws that don't explicitly distinguish between men and women but provide benefits to stay-at-home wives or young mothers. For example, a non-working spouse's ability to draw on Social Security or even grants encouraging girls' participation in scientific fields could be treated as barriers to \"equality.\"\n\nMoreover, the meaning of \"sex\" is far from clear, and in the hands of a liberal judge, the ERA could become another weapon against women-only spaces and religious liberty, if \"women\" is interpreted to include men who subjectively claim to be female.\n\nWhile many still view the ERA as a relic of history, the amendment will be a live issue going into 2020. ERA proponents claim that they can combine recent ratifications in Nevada and Illinois with those from the 1970s. Although Congress imposed a deadline of 1982 for getting the required two-thirds approval back when it sent the proposed amendment to the states in the 1970s, proponents argue that, once Virginia ratifies, all they need is a bare majority in the House and Senate to undo that deadline.\n\nCourts have ruled that amendments must be ratified in a reasonable time frame, but the 27th amendment was ratified more than two centuries after James Madison proposed it. The question of whether activists can get around the old congressional deadlines and the legality of using recent ratifications in combination with older ones remains unclear.\n\nWhile opponents can certainly marshal strong arguments against this unusual process for amending our highest law, many of these legal questions have never been confronted in the history of our republic. ERA opponents should not rely on the Supreme Court to bail them out if the ERA is \"ratified.\"\n\nThe Democratic House already held a hearing in April, and because Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins are already on record supporting the ERA, stopping it in the Republican-controlled Senate is far from assured.\n\nIn conclusion, the Equal Rights Amendment is a contentious issue that, if ratified, could have far-reaching implications for American law and society. Opponents must prepare to argue on the substance, emphasizing that men and women are already equal under American law, but they are not the same, and that's as it should be.",
    " Title: Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford Wins Special House Election, Defeats Elizabeth Colbert Busch\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested race, former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, once a rising star in the Republican Party, has won the special election for the state's open House seat, defeating Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Sanford captured 54 percent of the vote, compared to his opponent's 45 percent.\n\nThe South Carolina seat became vacant after Governor Nikki Haley appointed Rep. Tim Scott to the Senate seat vacated by Jim DeMint, a Republican who left to join the conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.\n\nThe race between Sanford and Colbert Busch, the sister of TV comedian and political satirist Stephen Colbert, was considered a dead heat by political analysts this week. However, Sanford's political comeback was marked by an easy victory.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon viewed the result as a bellwether for elections next year. \"These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014,\" Mr. Walden said in a prepared statement.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel had a different take, praising Colbert Busch for pushing Sanford into a competitive contest in a Republican-dominated district. He vowed that Democrats will be \"aggressive and drive deep into Republican-held territory this [election] cycle to find districts with flawed Republican candidates where we can compete.\"\n\nSanford, who has never lost a political race, once was mentioned as a possible 2012 presidential candidate. However, his reputation and career unraveled after he disappeared in 2009, supposedly to \"hike the Appalachian Trail,\" but instead traveled to Argentina to visit his mistress.\n\nHis candidacy seemed to be in trouble last month when his ex-wife, Jenny, filed a complaint accusing him of trespassing on her property during the Super Bowl. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm of House Republicans, also pulled its financial support from the campaign weeks ago.\n\nHowever, momentum in recent days shifted to Sanford when he received several high-profile Republican endorsements, including Rep. Tim Scott, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a tea party favorite who is considering a 2016 presidential run.\n\nBy Sunday, a poll by Public Policy Polling showed the race had become a tossup, with Sanford ahead 47 percent to 46 percent. Two weeks earlier, a PPP survey had Mr. Sanford trailing by 9 percentage points.\n\nSanford portrayed his opponent as an uncompromising liberal in lockstep with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and other national Democrats\u2014a devastating charge in the staunchly Republican coastal Carolina district. Colbert Busch pushed back, saying she would be an independent voice for the district.\n\nHowever, political forces may make it difficult for Sanford to repeat in the 2014 election. The former governor has been shunned by much of the Republican Party establishment since his 2009 scandal. The Republican establishment expects to put its weight behind a formidable opponent in the 2014 GOP primary.\n\nAs for whether Tuesday's special election has any deeper meaning on the national political landscape, many political analysts say no. \"I don't think this one reflects anything. It's all about Mark Sanford,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"Does anyone believe that any other Republican wouldn't be winning this in a landslide? It's a one-party district.\"",
    " Title: Newly Obtained Cable Suggests U.S. Knew of Benghazi Dangers Before 9/11 Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nA recently disclosed cable obtained by Fox News indicates that the U.S. Mission in Benghazi held an emergency meeting on Aug. 15, 2012, expressing concerns about the growing presence of al Qaeda and Islamist militias in the city. The cable, marked \"SECRET,\" suggests that the U.S. consulate in Benghazi could not withstand a coordinated attack, as the security measures, manpower, and overall size of the compound were deemed insufficient.\n\nAccording to the cable, the State Department's senior security officer, also known as the RSO, expressed concerns about the ability to defend the post in the event of a coordinated attack. The cable also briefed the Emergency Action Committee on the location of approximately ten Islamist militias and al Qaeda training camps within Benghazi, including groups such as the QRF Brigade and Ansar al-Sharia.\n\nThe cable's details seem to foreshadow the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. compound, which was a coordinated, commando-style assault using direct and indirect fire. Al Qaeda in North Africa and Ansar al-Sharia, both mentioned in the cable, have since been implicated in the consulate attack.\n\nThe cable also stated that the mission would submit specific requests for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. The cable's contents seem to contradict the administration's claims that the attack came without warning.\n\nIn a separate cable on Sept. 11, the day Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed, Stevens wrote about growing problems with security in Benghazi and growing frustration with the security forces and Libyan police. The ambassador saw both as \"too weak to keep the country secure.\"\n\nThe cable's disclosure adds to the growing controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack and its aftermath. The cable suggests that the State Department was aware of the imminent danger to its personnel in Benghazi and did not take adequate measures to protect them.",
    " Title: \"Protesters, Business Owners Challenge Shutdown Policies: A Balance Between Public Health and Economic Stability\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a nationwide movement, protesters are taking to the streets, and business owners are filing lawsuits, objecting to the shutdown rules that have been implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the shutdown continues, it is causing job losses, bankruptcies, and a sense that people are being deprived of their rights.\n\nThe liberal media has labeled the protesters as virus deniers, but the protesters argue that they have science, the U.S. Constitution, and common sense on their side. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated on Monday, \"This is not a sustainable situation. Close down everything, close down the economy, lock yourself in the house.\"\n\nStarting with the science, data show that almost all coronavirus fatalities are among the elderly and those with serious health problems. In Pennsylvania, 68 percent of deaths have been nursing-home residents, while in Rhode Island, it's 70 percent. Shutting down stores and restaurants did not save them.\n\nA lockdown targeted at protecting the highest-risk group, people 65 and over, instead of confining all age groups would slash deaths by half but at only half the economic cost of a total shutdown, according to new National Bureau of Economic Research findings.\n\nUnfortunately, social-media platforms are censoring science that challenges the shutdown. YouTube's policy is to ban content that \"disputes the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance.\" Shame on YouTube and its parent company, Google, for censoring views that are at odds with the World Health Organization, which helped get us into this mess.\n\nRemember that just a few weeks ago, shutting down schools and businesses was justified to \"flatten the curve,\" meaning buying time for hospitals to add beds and gather enough ventilators, masks, and other medical equipment. The shutdown's goal was not to eradicate the virus; that's not possible. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, as well as other experts, predicts the virus will last another 18 months to two years, fading once most Americans have been exposed and developed immunity.\n\nAs Colorado lifted its shutdown last week, the governor explained it's a \"balance\" between keeping the virus \"at a level that won't overwhelm our hospital systems and allowing people to still try and earn a living.\" Amen to that. The biggest divide in this country is about who's getting a paycheck.\n\nSome government officials who are paid show no respect for working people who aren't. How else to explain Governor Janet Mills' decision to bar Maine hotels from taking reservations for the summer season? Or Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer's attempt to close grass-mowing businesses, though the virus is seldom transmitted outdoors?\n\nWhen the shutdown was temporary and tied directly to hospital preparedness, lawsuits challenging it didn't stand a prayer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that a state \"has the right to protect itself against an epidemic\" using reasonable regulations.\n\nHowever, shutdowns lose their reasonableness when they have no deadline or benchmark to meet. Their vagueness tramples on the public's rights, including the right to own property without the government making it worthless.\n\nMonday, Cuomo set out a four-phase reopening. Not all of the benchmarks are wise, but benchmarks pegged to hospital capacity are on the mark. He should add nursing-home preparedness, too, because that's where deaths are occurring. Don't overlook that twice, governor.\n\nThe public should shudder at Mayor Bill de Blasio's vague announcement that the city's reopening is \"a few months away at a minimum.\" That could reduce the city to a wasteland of boarded-up storefronts, abandoned commercial buildings, landlords defaulting on taxes, and soaring tax rates for the taxpayers still in the city.\n\nAs for when New York schools reopen, science indicates schools aren't a source of transmission. If schools are kept closed in defiance of this fact, say goodbye to the middle class with kids. New York will be for the poor and uber-rich only.\n\nBetsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is chairwoman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.",
    " Title: The Resurgence of Secessionism: A Global Phenomenon and the Case of Scotland\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Boris Johnson's successful \"Get Brexit Done\" campaign, the United Kingdom is facing a potential internal division as Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, threatens secession from the United Kingdom if Britain leaves the European Union. This threat follows Scotland's vote in favor of remaining in the EU, a move that could potentially be mirrored by Northern Ireland, which also voted to remain.\n\nJohnson's government has stated that they will not allow a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, the Scottish National Party, which won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in Parliament, views this as a mandate for a new vote to secede. Sturgeon has been vocal about her stance, stating, \"If [Johnson] thinks... saying no is the end of the matter then he is going to find himself completely and utterly wrong... You can not hold Scotland in the union against its will.\"\n\nThis situation in Scotland raises questions about the right to self-determination in a democratic nation. If a majority of Scots wish to secede, how can a democratic Great Britain indefinitely deny them this right? Some argue that Scotland could become for Britain what Catalonia is to Spain, a region seeking independence.\n\nThe phenomenon of secessionism is not a new one. The most recent population explosion of new nations began three decades ago, with the secession of 15 republics from the USSR. Since then, several of these new nations have further unraveled, leading to the secession of Transnistria from Moldova, South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, and the Donbass from Ukraine.\n\nThe first great secessionist cause was the American Revolution, when the 13 American colonies declared and won independence from the British crown. The causes of secessionism have been rooted in issues of national identity, including ethnicity, religion, race, language, culture, and \"the mystic chords of memory.\" These issues of identity appear not to be receding but rising in various regions around the world, including the Caucasus, the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nAs more and more people identify themselves by who they are, and are not, secessions of people from each other will continue. The peace of mankind in the 21st century may well depend upon our ability to accommodate this inexorable secessionist drive to some degree. The United Nations, which began with 50 members in 1945, now has 193. Last week, Bougainville, a South Pacific island cluster of Papua New Guinea, voted 98% in a nonbinding referendum for independence, becoming the world's newest nation.\n\nAs the world continues to evolve, the question of secessionism and self-determination remains a complex and contentious issue. The resurgence of secessionism, as seen in Scotland and other regions, highlights the need for understanding, compromise, and a willingness to accommodate the desires of the people in order to maintain peace and stability.",

One case at a time. One decision at a time.\"\n\nThe release of the controversial Nunes memo, prepared at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), was approved by President Trump on Friday, over the objections of Wray and Justice Department leadership. In an unusual statement this week, the FBI issued a public statement expressing \"grave concerns\" about the accuracy of the memo.\n\nLate Friday, Wray urged the bureau to move on. \"We're going to keep doing that work because we know who and what we are and because we know our mission comes first,\" the director said. \"The American people come first.\"\n\nThe document, which focused on a 2016 surveillance warrant approved to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, assailed the bureau and Justice for relying on a dossier prepared by a British intelligence agent whose work was funded in part by Democrats.\n\n\"The FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,\" the FBI said earlier this week. \"As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\"\n\nThe release of the Nunes memo has sparked a political firestorm, with some Republicans arguing it reveals improper surveillance of the Trump campaign and Democrats contending it is a partisan attack on the FBI and Justice Department. The controversy could potentially lead to a showdown between the White House and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
    " Title: Record Number of Student Loans Utilize Income-Based Repayment Plans, According to DBRS Morningstar Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report, DBRS Morningstar has revealed that a record one-quarter of student loans backed by the U.S. government are utilizing income-based repayment plans, a figure that has risen from 21.8% in the previous year. This data was collected during the fourth-quarter of 2019.\n\nThe Obama administration introduced income-based repayment options in 2009, following the global financial crisis, which saw a significant decrease in credit availability and a surge in home foreclosures. The Federal Family Educational Loan Program (FFELP), initiated in 1965 to aid families in financing education and support the program's creditors, was one of the programs bolstered during this time. The government offered a near 99% backstop on all principal and interest due on loans made under the FFELP program. The Obama administration ended FFELP in 2010, effectively removing private lenders from the equation.\n\nThe expanded suite of federal loan payment options under Obama's administration set caps on loan repayments at 10% to 15% of a qualifying borrower's discretionary income. Any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 to 25 years. For lower-income students, this could mean no monthly payments at all, without causing borrower defaults or damaging their credit profile.\n\nInitially, it was expected that more than 1.6 million student loan borrowers would benefit from reduced monthly loan payments, despite the program not offering a way for students to refinance debt and secure historically low rates.\n\nThe popularity of income-based payment options has surged since 2011, as shown in the following chart.\n\nAddressing the nation's record $1.5 trillion pile of student loan debt has been a hot topic among Democratic presidential hopefuls. The issue even gained support from the Trump administration's former top Education Department official, A. Wayne Johnson, who, upon his resignation in October, called for the cancellation of most of the country's student loans.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student debt has become the second-largest source of U.S. household debt behind mortgages. In the first quarter of 2010, the student loan total was only $760 billion, roughly half its current total.\n\nThe New York Fed reported that 11.1% of all student loans were in default or seriously delinquent (more than 90 days past due) during the fourth-quarter. However, it is likely that this figure is actually twice as high, given that roughly half of student loans are in some form of deferment, grace period, or forbearance, and not counted as in \"repayment.\"\n\nDBRS Morningstar expects the combined utilization of deferment, forbearance, and income-based repayment (IBR) to remain elevated for the foreseeable future.",
    " Title: Virginia Gubernatorial Election: A Three-Way Race Amidst Low Turnout and Controversial Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming gubernatorial election on Nov. 5, Virginia will hold its Tuesday Night Football game, with the outcome potentially airing on Spike. Voters are encouraged to check their TV listings for the specific time and channel.\n\nThe state's decision to hold its gubernatorial elections in off years, without presidential or congressional races on the ballot, has left many puzzled. This year, turnout could set a new record low, as the latest polls indicate that Virginians are displeased with the two main candidates running for governor.\n\nTerry McAuliffe, 56, is one of the candidates. His claim to fame is his fundraising efforts for Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, but he has never held any elective office. McAuliffe is currently involved in not one but two federal investigations and has been accused of making money off terminally ill people. He resides in McLean, a suburb of Georgetown.\n\nThe other candidate is Ken T. Cuccinelli II, 45, a homegrown, up-from-the-bootstraps candidate. However, he has been criticized for his monotone speaking style and for walking into the \"Obama Playbook\" on women's issues such as abortion and reproductive health. He has also expressed conservative views on divorce.\n\nThe third candidate is Robert Sarvis, 37, a Libertarian who was born in Fairfax, the son of an English- and Irish-American and a Chinese immigrant. After attending one of the best high schools in the country, he went on to study mathematics at Harvard, attend the University of Cambridge, earn a law degree at NYU, and a master's in economics from George Mason University.\n\nSarvis left a legal career to join a software development business and founded a company that developed apps for Google's emerging Android operating system. He is married to a black pediatrician from Greenville, Mississippi, and is the father of two children.\n\nAlthough he ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a state Senate seat in 2011, he left the party to become a Libertarian. Sarvis takes a more moderate stance on personal issues, such as abortion and gay marriage, and advocates for the legalization of marijuana. He also supports protecting civil liberties, returning health care regulation to the states, upholding gun rights, eliminating Virginia's regressive \"car tax,\" and overhauling the tax code.\n\nThe latest poll puts Sarvis at 13 percent, which is not bad for a third-party candidate but not good for a candidate trying to become governor. Sarvis believes that if voters who are voting against the other candidates vote for him, he would win in a landslide.\n\nA Gallup poll in October found that 60 percent of Americans believe that the Democratic and Republican parties \"do such a poor job of representing the American people that a third major party is needed.\" Only 26 percent believe that the two major parties adequately represent Americans.\n\nSome argue that a vote for a third-party candidate is futile and stupid, a wasted vote. However, with the two main candidates being universally despised, some voters may choose to make a \"futile and stupid gesture\" and vote for Sarvis.\n\nThe situation in Virginia brings to mind the conclusion reached by Delta Tau Chi frat leaders in the movie \"Animal House\" when faced with a do-or-die decision. \"We got ta take these bastards,\" Otter says. \"Now, we could fight 'em with conventional weapons, but that could take years and cost millions of lives. Oh no. No, In this case, I think we have to go all out. I think this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part!\"",

    " Title: Potential Unintended Consequences of Tax Hikes on High Earners: A Look at the U.K. and U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama advocates for an increase in taxes on the highest-earning Americans, a move aimed at addressing the looming fiscal crisis, a closer look at historical data suggests that such tax hikes may not significantly reduce the nation's deficit as expected.\n\nIn fact, history provides examples where similar tax increases resulted in less additional revenue than anticipated, and unintended consequences. For instance, the United Kingdom's decision in April 2010 to increase the marginal tax rate by 10 percent, to 50 percent, for residents earning over $1 million led to a significant drop in the number of high earners declaring such income. According to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the U.K.'s tax collection agency, the number of individuals declaring over $1 million in income dropped from 16,000 to 6,000 in the 2010-2011 tax year.\n\nBefore the tax increase, the U.K.'s wealthiest comprised approximately 9 percent of the country's tax pool. This percentage dropped by half, to roughly 4.4 percent, after the tax increase. It is believed that wealthy Britons moved abroad or took steps to avoid paying the new levy by reducing their taxable incomes, according to a report in the London Telegraph.\n\nThe potential impact of President Obama's proposed tax hike on high earners, raising the marginal rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, in exchange for preserving existing Bush-era rates on Americans earning less than $250,000 annually, is a topic of debate among economists.\n\nDaniel J. Mitchell, a fiscal policy expert at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based, libertarian think tank, suggests that the main goal of the fiscal cliff negotiations is to impose a \"class-warfare tax hike.\" He warns that when targeting the \"rich,\" they have significant control over the timing, level, and composition of their income, enabling them to respond more easily when the government goes after them.\n\nOne option available to America's high earners to reduce their taxable income in the face of any tax increases is to move their wealth into tax-free bonds, according to Mitchell. However, economist Kent Smetters, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, notes that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has made it difficult to reclassify income as capital gains or classify money as earned outside of the United States, usually requiring tax shelters that the Treasury Department can deem as illegal.\n\nSmetters argues that the rich already pay a significant portion of the U.S. tax base because they have a hard time avoiding it. The challenge lies in the complexity of the tax code and the limited options available for high earners to reduce their taxable income without resorting to illegal tax shelters. This raises questions about the effectiveness of tax hikes on high earners as a means of significantly increasing government revenue and reducing the deficit.",

The white gunman, who targeted a Hispanic area, opened fire in the incident.\n\nDallas attorney Chris Ayres told The Associated Press that the call was made to the police in the suspected shooter's town of Allen, Texas, a Dallas suburb. Ayres and fellow attorney R. Jack Ayres told CNN that the suspect's mother contacted the Allen Police Department to inquire about an \"AK\"-type firearm he owned.\n\nOn Thursday, Chris Ayres confirmed the report to various media outlets. The attorneys stated that the mother was only seeking information and was not motivated by a concern that her son was a threat to anyone. They added that the mother did not identify herself or her son in the call.\n\nThe lawyers told CNN the mother was concerned about her son's age, maturity level, and lack of experience but was told by a public safety officer that her son, who is 21, was legally allowed to possess the weapon.\n\nA family statement sent by Chris Ayres to various media outlets said the suspected shooter acted outside the family's teachings and values. \"He was raised in a family that taught love, kindness, respect, and tolerance \u2013 rejecting all forms of racism, prejudice, hatred, and violence,\" the statement says. \"There will never be a moment for the rest of our lives when we will forget each and every victim of this senseless tragedy.\"\n\nSgt.

Authorities said he surrendered to police with his hands up about a quarter-mile from the El Paso Walmart where the attack happened.\n\nHe faces charges of capital murder in state court and may face federal hate crime charges that could carry a death sentence if he's convicted.",
    " Title: Kuwait Calls for Independent Investigation of Gaza Deaths as U.S., Israel Defend Israeli Response\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions escalated at the United Nations Security Council this week as Kuwait called for an independent investigation into the deaths of Palestinian protesters in Gaza, a request that was met with opposition from the United States and Israel. Ambassador Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi, representing Kuwait, criticized the council for not agreeing to his country's request, hinting at a possible investigation by the United Nations Human Rights Office instead.\n\nDiplomats reported that Kuwait had circulated a statement calling for an independent inquiry, which would require unanimous approval. However, the United States, defending Israel, disagreed with the proposal. Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States denounced what she called the double standard that other nations applied to Israel, questioning, \"Who among us would accept this type of activity on your border?\"\n\nHaley defended Israel's actions, stating that no country acted \"with more restraint than Israel.\" She attributed the violence to Hamas, which she claimed was inciting protesters to storm the fence, and insisted that there was no connection between the violence and celebrations on Monday for the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nPresident Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Haley argued, \"makes peace more achievable, not less.\"\n\nNickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for Middle East peace, addressed the council, finding fault with both Israel and Hamas. He emphasized Israel's responsibility to \"calibrate its use of force, to not use lethal force, except as a last resort, under imminent threat of death or serious injury.\" Mladenov also criticized Hamas for using the protests as cover to attempt to place bombs at the fence and create provocations, and for hiding its operatives among the demonstrators, risking the lives of civilians.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of Palestinian refugees rallied in southern Lebanon on Tuesday in commemoration of the \"Nakba\" and in solidarity with the Gaza demonstrations. Many were bused in from the longstanding refugee camps of Lebanon. Palestinians have a complex history with Lebanon, as the influx of refugees in 1948 exacerbated Lebanon's delicate sectarian balance, and their presence is often cited as a major contributing factor to Lebanon's 15-year civil war.\n\nCurrently, more than 450,000 of the world's five million registered Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon. Legally, their rights are limited, as Palestinians cannot own property or attend public schools, and are banned from working in more than 30 professions.",

When asked about the report, Comey stated, \"I was wrong, I was overconfident on our procedures.\"\n\nWhen pressed about the use of the unsubstantiated dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which was used to secure a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign aide Carter Page, Comey said, \"I'm not sure [Horowitz] and I are saying different things.\" He added, \"The FBI thought it was a close call... I don't think we're saying different things.\"\n\nHowever, host Chris Wallace challenged Comey's rationale, stating that Horowitz's report essentially refutes Comey's claim that the dossier was merely part of a \"broader mosaic\" of reasons for seeking permission to surveil Page.\n\nCurrent FBI Director Christopher Wray told The Associated Press last week that the report identified problems that are \"unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution.\" The FBI is taking more than 40 steps to address these problems, Wray said.\n\nIn his report, Horowitz called the dossier a \"central\" component of the application for the FISA warrant. Horowitz also told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that no one involved in the warrant application process should feel vindicated, rejecting claims of vindication made by Comey in an opinion piece earlier in the week.\n\nComey stated Sunday that he meant the report had debunked some of the gravest allegations made by Trump and his supporters. \"All of that was nonsense. I think it's really important that the inspector general looked at that and that the American people, your viewers and all viewers, understand that's true,\" Comey said.\n\nComey also criticized Attorney General William Barr for suggesting in a separate interview that the many errors by the FBI left open the possibility that agents may have acted in bad faith. \"The facts just aren't there, full stop,\" Comey said when asked whether Barr has a valid point. \"That doesn't make it any less consequential, any less important, but that's an irresponsible statement.\"\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was used in this story.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Mandates Free Contraceptive Coverage for Women, New York Attorney General Proposes Expanded Coverage for Men\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to clarify the rules surrounding contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration on Monday ordered all insurers to provide a range of contraceptive methods, including IUDs, the contraceptive patch, and the contraceptive vaginal ring, free of out-of-pocket charge to all women. The new rules aim to address reports of some insurance carriers refusing to cover all types of contraceptives.\n\nUnder the new guidance, insurers must cover at least one brand of contraception in each of 18 different methods outlined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as one type of oral contraceptive pill, one version of the emergency contraceptive morning-after pill, and the vaginal ring. In New York, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman has proposed legislation that would force insurance companies to pay for men's sterilization procedures, going beyond the federal level's requirements.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department stated that the new rules were implemented to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act and its contraceptive coverage provisions, which have been among the most controversial parts of the law. Insurers can still impose costs to encourage the use of generics rather than brand-name drugs under the new guidance, but if a doctor or hospital recommends a particular drug or contraceptive device out of medical necessity, the plans must cover them without additional cost.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, praised the new rules, stating, \"Today's announcement is an important step toward making it clear that all insurance companies should follow the rules and provide women with the health care they are entitled to.\" Insurers had sought more specifics about what was required under the Affordable Care Act, and some were reportedly refusing to fully cover all types of contraceptives, meaning women who wanted a particular form of birth control had to pay some or all of the costs.\n\nPro-choice groups and others had accused insurers of using so-called \"medical management\" to either skirt the rules or plead ignorance. For example, an inquiry by the New York attorney general found one plan told a patient she couldn't get the NuvaRing\u2014for which there is no generic on the market\u2014without cost-sharing because she could use birth control pills with the same chemical formulation.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate has been controversial from the start, with most attention focused on the marathon court battle between the administration and employers who have religious objections to contraceptives. The Supreme Court last year ruled that closely held corporations do not have to insure types of birth control that violate their moral beliefs, and the Obama administration is expected to update its rules soon. Religious nonprofits are still pursuing their cases through the courts, arguing that the \"accommodation\" the administration designed for them still leaves them complicit in contraceptive coverage.\n\nThe contraception rules were released as part of broader guidance on women's health services, including insisting on free screenings for women susceptible to certain types of cancer and prohibiting insurers from charging extra for anesthesia services provided with preventive colonoscopies. The rewrite will apply to future plan years, and insurers could have argued they were using \"good faith\" in more narrowly interpreting the current rules.\n\nMeanwhile, New York's top lawman tried to tackle the issue on his own, proposing legislation that would write Obamacare's coverage requirement into state law while piling on extra consumer protections\u2014even to men. Mr. Schneiderman said his bill would force every state-regulated health policy to cover all methods of FDA-approved contraceptives at no cost, akin to federal guidance, although consumers could also get a year's worth of contraception at a time. He also said men's sterilization procedures should be covered without cost sharing.\n\n\"New Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,\" Mr. Schneiderman said. America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry's top lobbying group, welcomed Monday's clarification, stating, \"Today's guidance takes important steps to support health plans' use of medical management in providing women with safe, affordable health care services.\"",
    " Title: Analysis: Trump's Cancellation of Taliban Summit: A Step Toward Avoiding Repeating Past Foreign Policy Mistakes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has canceled a planned summit with Taliban leaders aimed at finalizing a peace deal for Afghanistan. The decision has sparked criticism from Democrats, with presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar labeling Trump's foreign policy as a \"game show.\" However, this article argues that Trump's decision was a correct one, given the complex and sensitive nature of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban, responsible for the deaths of nearly 2,000 American soldiers and countless Afghan civilians, have a long history of brutality and terrorism. The United States' objective in Afghanistan is to ensure that it will never again serve as a haven for terrorists, a concern that is particularly relevant in light of the country's role in harboring al Qaeda before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMoreover, the United States must avoid signing a deal that would betray the Afghan government or allow the Taliban to take over the country and return it to medieval barbarity. The potential consequences of such a deal, including the abandonment of women and children to the mercy of Taliban murderers, would be a dishonorable end to the longest war in U.S. history.\n\nWhether or not Trump's decision to blame the collapse of the talks on last week's car bomb attack that cost the life of a US soldier is accurate, the fact remains that the outcome of the talks would not have ensured America's security or the security of the people Trump proposes to leave behind.\n\nThe cancellation of the summit is a step toward avoiding repeating past foreign policy mistakes, such as those made by President Barack Obama in his pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran and his unilateral withdrawal from Iraq, which led to the rise of ISIS and more bloodshed. While Trump's decision may be criticized for its theatrical style, it is a far better alternative than sticking with a deal that would have been a humiliating defeat for U.S. interests.\n\nJonathan Tobin, editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributor to National Review, argues that there is more to achieving America's objectives or ending a war where the other side intends to go on fighting than signing a piece of paper. President Trump's pull-back from the brink of repeating Obama's mistakes may be undignified in the eyes of some Democrats, but it is a necessary step toward avoiding a disastrous outcome in Afghanistan.",
    " Title: President Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden Voices Support as Primary Rival Bernie Sanders Meets with Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the 2016 presidential race, former President Barack Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton on Thursday, praising her qualifications and expressing his readiness to campaign for her. The endorsement comes as Clinton's primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, has vowed to continue his campaign through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday.\n\nIn a video message posted on Clinton's campaign site, Obama said, \"I know how hard this job can be. That's why I know Hillary will be so good at it. In fact, I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together on June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted, \"Honored to have you with me, @POTUS. I'm fired up and ready to go!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Clinton Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention.\n\nThe White House said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination. The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders.\n\nSanders, after the meeting, struck a conciliatory tone, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can \"work together to defeat Donald Trump.\" Sanders still plans to compete in next Tuesday's Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been the two remaining candidates in the Democratic primary race. Sanders' tone appeared to soften after his meeting with Obama, offering no endorsement but congratulating Clinton \"on her very strong campaign.\"\n\nSanders thanked Obama for his \"impartiality\" throughout the process and said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their \"thumb on the scales.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying \"it is time now to unite our party.\"\n\nClinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders and his supporters into the fold. The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Donald Trump intensifies.\n\nSanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he'll do everything in his power to prevent Trump's election.\n\nSpeculation over the future of Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has swirled for months, with Sanders' team long accusing her of helping Clinton. Whether Sanders seeks Wasserman Schultz's removal or the president would consider such a move is unclear.\n\nAsked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she's not worried about her job. \"I'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president's support,\" she said.",
    " Title: Lobbying Activity in Washington Reaches Record High in 2017, with Google, Open Society Policy Center, and National Association of Realtors Leading the Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Lobbying activity in Washington reached a record high of $3.34 billion last year, according to a new report from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. This marks the highest level since 2010, as corporations, trade groups, and other interests sought to influence policy during President Trump's first year in office.\n\nThe report shows that powerful trade groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors, spent the most money to shape policy in 2017. Google, a tech giant, and the nonprofit Open Society Policy Center, aligned with liberal billionaire George Soros, also reported significant increases in their lobbying spending.\n\nGoogle's federal spending jumped to $18 million last year, a new high in the company's lobbying history in Washington. Tech companies are facing increasing scrutiny as lawmakers consider regulating online advertising and investigating Russia's use of social media platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election. Google reportedly lobbied on various issues, including cybersecurity, tax legislation, immigration, and the controversial travel ban.\n\nThe Open Society Policy Center reported $16.1 million in spending last year, a record for the organization since it began reporting federal lobbying in 2002. Much of the money, a total of $10.3 million, was spent in the last three months of the year and largely reflects grants Open Society made to other, aligned groups to support their lobbying activity, officials said. The organization's lobbying efforts included a push to limit child trafficking and measures introduced by congressional Democrats that would prohibit President Trump from making a preemptive strike against North Korea without congressional approval.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors also saw a surge in lobbying activity, spending $22.2 million during the fourth-quarter of 2017, double what it spent during the previous three months. The trade group waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to reshape the tax overhaul that sped through Congress at year's end. The Realtors flew in local Realtors to Washington and ran ads targeting key lawmakers as it worked to defeat a slew of provisions opposed by the industry in an original House version of the tax bill.\n\nThe Realtors have touted several wins, including preserving an exemption from capital gains taxes when homeowners profit from the sale of their primary residence and beating back a provision that would have limited the mortgage interest deduction for home purchases to those with new loans of $500,000 or less. The Realtors have also begun lobbying to ease other provisions that made it into the final law, such as a new, $10,000 cap on the deductions that individual taxpayers can take to offset local and state income, sales, and property taxes.\n\nThe surge in lobbying activity during the last three months of 2017 reflects a flurry of legislative activity in the final months of the year, as lawmakers rushed to pass the tax overhaul and other key pieces of legislation before the end of the year. The high level of lobbying spending also underscores the intense interest and influence of various industries and interest groups in shaping policy in Washington.",
    " Title: Political Debate Intensifies Over Medicare Reform as Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the upcoming presidential election, the debate over Medicare reform has taken center stage, with both the Obama administration and the Romney-Ryan ticket engaging in heated exchanges over the future of the entitlement program.\n\nMitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, have accused President Obama of hurting seniors by slashing $716 billion out of Medicare. In contrast, Obama has attacked Ryan for wanting to \"end Medicare as we know it.\" These exchanges highlight the differing philosophies of the two parties as they seek to curb Medicare spending before the program runs out of money.\n\nUnder Obama's health reform law, Medicare savings are achieved by reducing payments to providers, including hospitals, insurers, and other healthcare facilities. The law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is tasked with keeping Medicare costs under control. However, benefits cannot be cut to reduce expenses.\n\nRyan's budget proposal, on the other hand, would allow insurers to offer seniors a range of choices, with the government providing a \"premium support\" payment to cover the cost of either traditional Medicare or the second-least expensive insurer's plan. Seniors can pay for additional coverage, such as dental or vision benefits.\n\nConsumer advocates have expressed concerns that seniors would pay more for care under the Ryan plan, with spending expected to be between 35% and 42% lower for new enrollees under the Ryan plan versus traditional Medicare. Critics argue that the Ryan plan could have a harmful effect on beneficiaries in the long run.\n\nSupporters of the Ryan plan, however, argue that senior citizens will end up sacrificing under the president's health reform law. They point to the possibility of providers stopping accepting Medicare if rates are slashed too low.\n\nThe future of Medicare has become a crucial issue in the election, as both parties seek to win over the voting block of senior citizens. The Medicare program is expected to run out of money in 2024, and both sides are looking for ways to curb its costs.\n\nThe debate over Medicare reform is likely to continue as the election approaches, with both sides presenting their plans to address the financial challenges facing the program. It remains to be seen which approach will be more effective in ensuring the long-term sustainability of Medicare for future generations of seniors.",
    " Title: Report Reveals Discrepancies in US Immigration Enforcement Program Focusing on 'Criminal Aliens'\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report has shed light on discrepancies within the United States' Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), a program designed to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records. The analysis of requests by federal officials for local jails to detain immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law found that half of the individuals targeted had no criminal conviction.\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), based at Syracuse University, obtained the records through an open records request. The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. Only one quarter of the individuals had committed the most serious types of offenses, such as murder or sexual assault.\n\nThe PEP, which was implemented in November 2014, was intended to focus on \"criminal aliens\" convicted of felonies or several misdemeanor offenses. However, the most recent data shows that ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before.\n\nICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said the agency \"continues to make significant strides... through PEP to ensure a common-sense approach that focuses enforcement resources on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security.\" However, the report suggests that the policies may not be achieving their intended purpose.\n\nMaria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant living in Philadelphia, met with Homeland Security director Jeh Johnson in May to discuss the PEP program. Sotomayor expressed concerns that the detainers could discourage immigrants from reporting crimes due to the risk of being picked up themselves.\n\nBefore PEP was officially implemented, at least 377 local law enforcement agencies were refusing to honor some or all requests to hold immigrants in detention from ICE. The agency claims that 17 of the 25 jurisdictions with the highest number of declined detainers are now participating in the program.\n\nImmigration advocates have sued to obtain more details about how the PEP program differs from its predecessor. Jessica Bansel, legal director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, suspects that the PEP program is merely a rebranding of the previous program. She noted that while ICE can now ask local jails to inform them when an immigrant is in custody, not to detain them, the agency also has two new detainer forms that are specifically designed to request custody of a person who recently entered the country illegally but has not been convicted of a crime and is not a security risk.\n\nThe report comes as immigration remains a contentious issue in the United States. According to 2012 figures, there are about 8 million unauthorized migrants either working or looking for work, or 5.1% of the labor force. Since 2009, more Mexicans have been leaving the US than entering, likely due to a slow economic recovery since the recession and stricter border enforcement. Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other president. His executive orders protect at least 1.2 million people from deportations.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Halts President Trump's Border Wall Construction Plans, Citing Constitutional Separation of Powers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant setback for President Donald Trump, a federal judge on Friday issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from constructing sections of the border wall that were already underway in Texas and Arizona. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam, an Obama appointee, found that the president and his team overstepped their powers by rearranging Pentagon funds for border wall construction after Congress had approved far less than the president wanted.\n\nJudge Gilliam's ruling is a substantial blow to President Trump, who had orchestrated a government shutdown to try to secure funding for the border wall, then signed a bill to reopen the government without getting the wall money he sought. The president had been counting on his emergency powers, which he said allowed him to tap the Pentagon's money to build border barriers.\n\nHowever, the judge found that the administration's use of funds for the border wall construction was not allowed under the law. The Defense Department had to siphon money from other accounts to fill the drug corridor fund, something Judge Gilliam said isn't allowed in this case. The Justice Department had argued that Congress didn't explicitly deny the administration the ability to use the money, but Judge Gilliam disagreed, stating that the president is bound only to spend on exactly what Congress authorizes.\n\nThe ruling is one of several legal challenges to President Trump's emergency declaration. Cases in Texas and Washington, D.C., are still proceeding. The judge did not rule on the government's plans to tap the $3.6 billion in emergency declaration money, but given the tenor and reasoning in Friday's opinion, it's difficult to imagine Judge Gilliam would find use of that money for a border wall legal at this point.\n\nPresident Trump, who was traveling in Japan during the ruling, lashed out at Judge Gilliam on Twitter, saying he was enabling criminals by ruling against the president's most prominent campaign promise. The president did not comment on Judge Gilliam's legal reasoning, but said he was hurting the country's safety.\n\nPresident Trump initially requested $1.6 billion in border wall money for 2019, then upped that request to $5 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. Congress, after an election, one government shutdown, and a change in power in the House, approved $1.375 billion. President Trump signed that legislation in February, then immediately declared a national emergency and issued a memo authorizing the Defense Department to tap $2.5 billion in drug interdiction accounts and another $3.6 billion in military construction funds to build the wall. He also authorized use of $601 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund.\n\nUnder the law, the drug interdiction money can be used to build walls in drug corridors, but the fund didn't have $2.5 billion, so the Defense Department said it would reprogram money from elsewhere to fill out those accounts. It authorized $1 billion in transfers. That's the money Judge Gilliam halted.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Challenges in Second Term as Approval Ratings Dip and Political Gridlock Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nWith three years remaining in his presidency, President Barack Obama finds himself in a defensive position, facing a Republican-controlled House and a Senate that may soon follow suit. The hopes Obama expressed last year that his re-election would \"break the fever\" of unyielding Republican opposition have proven to be misguided.\n\nGOP consultant Whit Ayres notes that President Obama is at his weakest point in his presidency so far. House Republicans view everything Obama proposes as dead on arrival, and the major legislation he pushed through while Democrats still controlled Congress, such as the Affordable Care Act, remains contentious. The law's politically disastrous rollout has put the president on the defensive.\n\nA Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Obama's approval rating at a low ebb of 39 percent. Other polls have also registered slippage. The two parties' unceasing mode of castigating each other does not bode well for any future deal-making.\n\nSoon after winning re-election, Obama achieved one of his goals - a tax package enacted at the start of the year that had the effect of raising income tax rates for top earners. However, this package only delayed by two months the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. Obama has been unable to replace those cuts or reach any kind of broader budget agreement with Republicans.\n\nLast month's deal that ended the partial government shutdown called for a joint House-Senate committee to address larger fiscal concerns. The committee met once publicly, then adjourned for a month. On other issues, Obama has failed to get traction. The Senate-passed immigration bill - a major second-term priority for the president - appears to have no life in the House.\n\nDemocratic consultant Jim Jordan notes that Obama and his agenda are \"vastly more popular\" than the GOP. However, he also notes that the Republican Party will continue to obstruct policy that the public roundly supports. \"The president's legislative prospects are not particularly bright, as I think the White House will concede,\" Jordan says.\n\nRepublicans look at Tuesday's election results and see no evidence they suddenly need to embrace the president. Instead, they look at the most important Democratic victory, in the Virginia gubernatorial race, and see hope for their side. The race ended up being a closer one than predicted, and exit polls indicated that voters blamed both parties equally for the shutdown, while a majority disliked Obamacare.\n\nThe health care law may or may not ultimately prove a great boon for the country, but in political terms, there could be more pain to come for Obama and his party. Obama's broken promise about people being able to keep insurance plans they liked has so far applied only to the relatively small market of people who buy coverage as individuals. If Americans who are covered through employer-backed plans see cost increases or other changes, Republicans will be sure to blame the law that bears the president's name.\n\n\"For Republicans, it's like the anti-war movement was for Democrats in 2006 - it's what they live for, fighting Obamacare,\" says William Schneider, a senior fellow at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. \"They'll stop at nothing, including shutting down the government.\"\n\nObama's broken promise about people being able to keep insurance plans they liked has so far applied only to the relatively small market of people who buy coverage as individuals.

The president remains in an ongoing campaign mode, trying to sell ideas that his opponents will never accept. \"Very little is now possible that was not possible before,\" says Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College. \"He looks like a very typical second-term president - not so popular, the agenda's stuck, a little bit of scandal is starting to creep out, and he's hunkering down to ride out the rest of his term.\"",
    " Title: \"Ted Cruz's 2012 Senate Campaign: A Closer Look at the Cruzes' Financial Disclosures\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2013 Texas Senate primary, Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi Cruz, made a significant financial commitment to his campaign, pouring their savings into the race. According to a 2013 interview with The Times, Mr. Cruz proposed the idea to his wife, who, despite initial polls showing him as a long shot against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, agreed without hesitation.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Cruz later suggested a more nuanced perspective in a 2014 interview with Politico, stating that they should have applied \"common investment sense\" and not use their own money for the campaign unless it made a significant difference in winning. The article did not mention any loans from banks.\n\nThe Cruzes' financial support allowed Mr. Cruz's campaign to maintain television advertising in the primary election period, including a $300,000 ad buy highlighting the story of Mr. Cruz's father's escape from Cuba in the 1950s. Mr. Cruz's strong performance in the primary qualified him for a runoff, where he ultimately defeated Mr. Dewhurst and went on to win the general election.\n\nCandidates are required to disclose their assets in broad categories in ethics reports filed with the Senate. Mr. Cruz's filings for the close of 2011 show that he and his wife had cash and securities in bank, brokerage, and retirement accounts worth $1.3 million to $3.4 million. They also had mortgages and a loan against Mr. Cruz's partnership equity in his law firm.\n\nIn 2012, the Cruzes sold securities worth $82,000 to $355,000, and the value of other holdings was reduced by, at most, $155,000. However, they also added a money-market account with $250,000 to $500,000, and the value of other holdings increased by as much as $435,000. All told, the value of their cash and securities in 2012 saw a net increase of as much as $400,000\u2014a seemingly contradictory development, given that the Cruzes were supposedly liquidating their assets to finance Mr. Cruz's Senate campaign.",
    " Title: Obama's Misleading Statements on Muslim Rejection of Terrorism: A Closer Look at the Facts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent address, former President Barack Obama emphasized the Christian faith he holds and his sympathy towards Islam. However, his statement that \"99.9 percent of Muslims worldwide reject terrorism\" has been met with skepticism, as it appears to be an overestimation of the Muslim rejection of terrorism.\n\nWhile it is true that many Muslims have condemned the recent attacks in Paris, it is important to put radical Islamic terrorism in perspective. Muslims have served in every American war, and over 3,500 Muslims currently serve in the U.S. military. Muslim soldiers are honored with medals and buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the data from Pew Research reveals a different picture. Only 57 percent of Muslims in nine predominantly Islamic countries hold an unfavorable opinion of al-Qaeda. This is significantly lower than the 99.9 percent that President Obama claimed.\n\nFurthermore, one in four Muslims have a favorable opinion of Hezbollah, a group that has been linked to the use of torture techniques on American captives, such as William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut. Another third, or 33 percent, support Hamas, a group responsible for the bombing of a hotel in Netanya, Israel, during a Passover supper, which resulted in the death of 30 and the wounding of 140 others.\n\nPresident Obama's statements have been criticized for being misleading and not reflecting the reality of the situation. It is important to acknowledge the existence of radical Islamic terrorism and to address it effectively, rather than downplaying its presence and impact.\n\nWesley Pruden, editor in chief emeritus of The Washington Times, noted that if Muslims shunned terrorists by the same percentages that Christians shun the Ku Klux Klan, President Obama's statement would be accurate. However, this is not the case, and it is important for political leaders to present accurate and unbiased information to the public.",
    " Title: President Trump Acknowledges Reimbursement of Hush Money to Stormy Daniels, Stresses Personal Nature of Payment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump admitted to reimbursing his attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) to silence her about allegations of an affair. The president emphasized that the payment was a private, non-campaign-related agreement.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.\"\n\nThe president further stated, \"These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case, it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.\"\n\nTrump also tweeted that the agreement was a private one, and that campaign funds played no role in the transaction. He was referring to a letter written and signed by Daniels in January, stating \"with complete clarity\" that allegations of an affair with Trump were \"absolutely false.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, who recently joined Trump's legal team, clarified on \"Fox & Friends\" that Trump \"didn't know the details of this until we knew the details of this\" a couple of weeks ago. He has said Trump thought it was to cover unspecified \"expenses.\"\n\nGiuliani stressed that this was a personal payment and disputed any suggestion that it was an unreported campaign contribution. He stated, \"That money was not campaign money.\"\n\nWhether Giuliani's argument holds up remains to be seen. A candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to their campaign, but contributions are supposed to be officially reported. If the payments were wholly personal, there would be no campaign finance violations. However, Giuliani's argument that the payment was unrelated to the campaign could well be challenged. If it's considered a campaign-related expense, the onus may have been on the president or his campaign to report it as a loan.\n\nStormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, stated on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that if it's \"true\" that Trump reimbursed Cohen, it's a \"crime\" with \"serious consequences.\" Cohen previously stated that the money he paid to Daniels came out of his own pocket. Both Trump's and Giuliani's statements now seem to contradict Cohen's account. Cohen is currently under criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe looking into his personal business dealings.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Admits Error in Release of Illegal Immigrant, Urges Cooperation with Federal Agents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson admitted that the administration erred in releasing an illegal immigrant to the sanctuary city of San Francisco before the shocking murder of Kathryn Steinle earlier this month. However, Johnson stated that there is little the government can do to pressure sanctuary cities to change their policies.\n\nJohnson made personal appeals to San Francisco to reconsider its refusal to allow police cooperation with federal immigration agents, and will continue to do so in the wake of Steinle's death. He declined to criticize sanctuary cities and advised against passing laws that would force cooperation, stating that such measures could conflict with the Constitution and would not win over reluctant communities.\n\nRepublican lawmakers expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of Johnson's approach, particularly in the case of the five cities and counties that have already turned him down. They questioned why Johnson and President Obama have not taken a tougher stance on recalcitrant sanctuary cities.\n\nSteinle's death has refocused the immigration debate, with attention now on victims of illegal immigration. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the suspect in Steinle's murder, had been deported five times before and was released from San Francisco's custody despite requests from immigration agents to hold him for pickup.\n\nJohnson stated that his department and the Bureau of Prisons should have communicated better regarding the case, and suggested that some discretion may have been needed to prioritize the homeland security claim over San Francisco's sanctuary policy. The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to requests for comment on how it handled the case.\n\nJohnson has not yet contacted Steinle's family, and it is unclear if any other administration officials have done so. This drew criticism from Rep. Steve Chabot, who suggested that administration officials should reach out to the family in this instance.\n\nThe administration's stance on sanctuary cities has evolved since it sued Arizona over its immigration laws in 2012. Then-ICE Director John Morton had pushed for punishing sanctuary cities within the administration, but was reportedly blocked by the Justice Department. New ICE Director Sarah R. Saldana has since stated that she would welcome a law forcing communities to cooperate, but later retracted that statement after receiving a talking-to from Johnson.\n\nBeyond the sanctuary city issue, Johnson reported that border security is improving, with Border Patrol agents on pace to apprehend fewer than 400,000 illegal immigrants this year, which could be the lowest total since the 1970s. The agency states that this means fewer people are attempting to cross in the first place.\n\nHomeland Security has focused on illegal immigrants with serious criminal histories, leading to a decrease in deportations and detention beds going unused. Johnson stated that they are currently using an average of 31,000 beds, more than the 27,000 held at the beginning of the year but still short of the 34,000 mandated by Congress. Despite leaving beds unused, the department continues to release immigrants with serious criminal records who go on to commit more crimes after their release.\n\nMore than 1,000 criminal aliens released into the community while awaiting deportation in 2014 were convicted of additional crimes, including kidnapping, sexual assault against a child, and vehicular homicide, according to statistics released Tuesday by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.",
    " Title: Mystery Surrounds Edward Snowden's Whereabouts as He Remains in Moscow Airport's Transit Zone\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of a global diplomatic standoff, Edward Snowden, the world's most sought-after leaker, continues to elude the public eye, reportedly residing in the Moscow airport's \"transit zone.\"\n\nLast week, Russian officials confirmed Snowden's presence in the airport, while maintaining that he was not on their territory and refusing to intervene in his case. However, the media, including reporters who swarmed the airport, were unable to locate him. Even Snowden's father, Lonnie Snowden, is still attempting to establish a \"direct communications link\" with his son, as his attorney, Bruce Fein, revealed to Fox News on Monday.\n\nIan Phillips, the Associated Press' Eastern Europe news director, spent 21 hours in the Moscow transit zone last week in a futile attempt to find Snowden. Phillips believes Snowden might be hiding in the Novotel, a peculiar hotel with a wing jutting into the international transit zone, where Phillips stayed last Thursday and Friday, to no avail.\n\nHowever, Phillips admits, \"there are many places he can be.\" WikiLeaks, which is aiding Snowden and claims to have an adviser traveling with him, could potentially shed light on Snowden's whereabouts and circumstances. On Monday, WikiLeaks announced it would make several important announcements during the day, hinting at potential revelations about Snowden's situation.\n\nReports later emerged that the WikiLeaks adviser traveling with Snowden had submitted a request for political asylum to Russia. The details about his current whereabouts remain unclear.\n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was evasive during a Sunday show interview about Snowden's circumstances, stating, \"The situation now with Edward Snowden is a very sensitive one. It's a matter of international diplomatic negotiations.\"\n\nLast week, after Snowden landed in Moscow, Assange only confirmed that Snowden and the WikiLeaks adviser were \"healthy and safe.\"\n\nSpeculation persists about Snowden's whereabouts, though U.S. officials maintain they believe he is at the Moscow airport\u2014somewhere. Russian news reports claimed last week he was at a hotel in the terminal itself. However, the Associated Press could not find any sign of Snowden at the on-site hotel or any worker who would confirm he was staying there.\n\nThe AP reporter entered the transit zone\u2014a sprawling area comprising several terminals, as well as the usual mix of duty-free shops and other stores\u2014last Wednesday in search of Snowden. Although finding no trace of Snowden, the AP noted that, aside from the hotel, there are a number of small rooms where someone could potentially hide.\n\nSnowden was not found in any of the VIP lounge areas. The AP then sent Phillips to the Novotel on Thursday. Phillips described an \"Orwellian\" experience there, and on Monday, he recounted his visit to FoxNews.com.\n\nPhillips arrived last week with the understanding \"it was a long shot.\" He took a bus and \"walked in a free man into the lobby of what looked like a fantastic hotel.\" However, a guard then escorted him to the old wing of the hotel where travelers without visas\u2014like Snowden\u2014are kept under tight security.\n\nPhillips tried to call the other rooms and hang out in the corridor, hoping to catch a glimpse of Snowden. No luck. Any further movement was prohibited. \"I walked out the first night, and the guard jumped up as if to say 'what are you doing?'\" Phillips said. \"I think we expected a bit more freedom to roam.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said that if Snowden is in the transit zone, there's a \"fairly good chance\" he's at the Novotel, given how secure it is.\n\nWith Russia and now Ecuador trying to distance themselves from Snowden's case, it's unclear who has actually had face-to-face contact with him besides the WikiLeaks adviser.\n\nFein, the attorney for Snowden's father, told Fox News that the family is currently trying to get information to Edward Snowden so he can make an informed decision about what legal options are available. The father last week sent a letter to the Justice Department in hopes of securing a few key conditions for Snowden to return. He asked that Snowden not be detained before trial, not be subject to a gag order, and have a trial in a venue of his choosing.\n\nHowever, Fein clarified to Fox News that these are not \"ultimatums\" and that the father is also respecting his son's wishes. \"He's an adult. He has to chart his own destiny, and his father's not going to dictate that,\" Fein said.",
    " Title: Challenging Biased News Coverage: A Guide to Identifying and Addressing Media Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of news media, it is crucial for outlets to uphold integrity, objectivity, and accuracy. To challenge biased news coverage, it is essential to document instances of bias and hold media accountable for their reporting. Here are some questions to ask yourself about newspaper, TV, and radio news:\n\n1. Be aware of the political perspective of the sources used in a story. Media often rely on \"official\" sources such as government, corporate, and establishment think tank figures. A study by FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting) found that in 40 months of Nightline programming, the most frequent guests were Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Elliott Abrams, and Jerry Falwell, while progressive and public interest voices were underrepresented.\n\n2. To portray issues fairly and accurately, media must broaden their spectrum of sources. Count the number of corporate and government sources versus the number of progressive, public interest, female, and minority voices. Demand that media expand their rolodexes; better yet, provide them with lists of progressive and public interest experts in the community.\n\n3. Examine the race and gender diversity at the news outlet you watch compared to the communities it serves. How many producers, editors, or decision-makers at news outlets are women, people of color, or openly gay or lesbian? In order to fairly represent different communities, news outlets should have members of those communities in decision-making positions.\n\n4. Analyze the racial and gender composition of the experts these news outlets cite. A study by FAIR found that Nightline's U.S. guests were 92 percent white and 89 percent male, while a similar survey of PBS's NewsHour found its guestlist was 90 percent white and 87 percent male.\n\n5. Demand that those affected by the issue have a voice in coverage. Political coverage often focuses on how issues affect politicians or corporate executives rather than those directly affected by the issue. For example, many stories on parental notification of abortion emphasize the \"tough choice\" confronting male politicians while quoting no women under 18\u2014those with the most at stake in the debate.\n\n6. Expose double standards by coming up with a parallel example or citing similar stories that were covered differently. Does coverage of the drug crisis focus almost exclusively on African Americans, despite the fact that the vast majority of drug users are white? Does coverage of women on welfare focus overwhelmingly on African-American women, despite the fact that the majority of welfare recipients are not black?\n\n7. Educate journalists about misconceptions involved in stereotypes and how stereotypes characterize individuals unfairly. Often, the most important message of a story is not explicitly stated. For instance, in coverage of women on welfare, the age at which a woman had her first child will often be reported\u2014the implication being that the woman's sexual \"promiscuity,\" rather than institutional economic factors, are responsible for her plight.\n\n8. When media adopt loaded terminology, they help shape public opinion. For example, media often use the right-wing buzzword \"racial preference\" to refer to affirmative action programs. Polls show that this decision makes a huge difference in how the issue is perceived.\n\n9. Challenge the assumption directly. Often bringing assumptions to the surface will demonstrate their absurdity. Most reporters will not say directly that a woman deserved to be raped because of what she was wearing.\n\n10. Demonstrate how the language chosen gives people an inaccurate impression of the issue, program, or community. Coverage of so-called \"reverse discrimination\" usually fails to focus on any of the institutional factors that give power to prejudice\u2014such as larger issues of economic inequality and institutional racism. Coverage of hate speech against gays and lesbians often fails to mention increases in gay-bashing and how the two might be related.\n\n11. Provide the context. Communicate to the journalist, or write a letter to the editor that includes the relevant information.\n\n12. Be mindful of headlines, as they have a significant impact on public opinion. A classic case: In a New York Times article on the June 1988 U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow, Margaret Thatcher was quoted as saying of Reagan, \"Poor dear, there's nothing between his ears.\" The Times headline: \"Thatcher Salute to the Reagan Years.\" Call or write the newspaper and point out the contradiction.\n\nBy asking these questions and being aware of the biases in news coverage, we can work towards a more informed and equitable society.",
    " Title: Senate Candidates Distancing Themselves from Obama in Pre-Election Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final four weeks leading up to the November 4th elections, the influence of President Obama is palpable in debates across key Senate races in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. Republicans have been consistently using the unpopular president as a point of attack, urging Democratic Senate candidates to distance themselves from Mr. Obama.\n\nIn races where an incumbent Democrat is running for reelection, the attacks have been consistent: the candidates have been accused of voting with the president 99%, 96%, or 97% of the time. In open-seat races, Democrats have been portrayed as Obama's allies.\n\nThe responses from the Democrats have been uniform: they have emphasized that they are running against their Republican opponents, not President Obama.\n\nIn the North Carolina debate, Senator Kay Hagan (D) was asked for ways in which she disagrees with Obama and the Democrats. Hagan, who is in a tight race with state House Speaker Thom Tillis (R), listed her disagreements on issues such as the use of military force in Syria, the Keystone XL pipeline, trade deals, and military budget cuts.\n\nIn Virginia, Senator Mark Warner (D) also distanced himself from Obama, despite his comfortable lead against GOP challenger Ed Gillespie. Like Hagan, Senator Warner expressed support for the Keystone pipeline and backed offshore drilling in Virginia, provided the state shares in the revenue.\n\nIn West Virginia, underdog candidate Natalie Tennant (D) joined her Republican opponent, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), in opposing proposed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency that would tighten standards on coal-burning power plants.\n\nPolitical handicappers give Republicans a slight advantage in their quest to retake control of the Senate, but no one rules out the Democrats' chances of holding on. The debates on Tuesday were largely free of major gaffes, though North Carolina's Thom Tillis misstated one of Hagan's committee assignments in the Senate multiple times before he was corrected.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is that Obama's low job approvals weigh heavily on them, particularly in red states. Obama himself invited the distancing when he declared that his policies are \"on the ballot\" on Nov. 4. However, Obama was already a significant presence in the debates, in spirit if not literally, well before he made that remark.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad for the president on Tuesday. Senator Mark Udall (D) of Colorado, facing a stiff challenge from Rep. Cory Gardner (R), deflected efforts to get him to criticize the president. Udall also offered strong support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the president's signature initiative.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn hesitated when asked her opinion of the ACA, before she listed ways the law could be improved.\n\nDemocrats also came prepared with their own attack lines in Tuesday's debates, tailored to each state and candidate. In North Carolina, Hagan criticized the state General Assembly under Tillis's leadership, while in Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn went after Republican opponent David Perdue for his business career. In Colorado, Udall attacked Congressman Gardner for his past support for \"personhood\" measures, which assert that life begins at conception and would ban some forms of contraception.\n\nGardner responded, \"It's simply outrageous to believe that someone would try to ban birth control.\" The debates on Tuesday provided a glimpse into the key issues that will shape the final weeks of the Senate races and the broader political landscape of the United States.",
    " Title: US Attorney General Defends Border Separation Policy, UN Calls for Immediate Halt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent radio interview, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. Sessions argued that while authorities prefer to keep children close to their parents, this is not always possible. The issue has sparked a growing controversy after US officials confirmed hundreds of child migrants had been removed from their families.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations called on the US to \"immediately halt\" the separations. When asked whether it was \"absolutely necessary\" to separate children from their parents, Mr. Sessions replied in the affirmative. He compared the situation to US children being taken away from their families if their parents are serving prison sentences.\n\nMr. Sessions insisted that migrant children were \"being well taken care of.\" He added, \"It's certainly not our goal to separate children, but I do think it's clear, it's legitimate to warn people who come to the country unlawfully bringing children with them that they can't expect that they'll always be kept together.\"\n\nIn early May, Mr. Sessions announced that anyone found crossing the border illegally would be prosecuted and face possible separation from their children. Previously, those crossing the border illegally for the first time were often charged with a misdemeanor offense, before often being released to face a court hearing. Most never turned up for those hearings, say Trump administration officials.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office's spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, criticized the policy on Tuesday and said that several hundred children, some as young as one, appeared to have been affected. \"The use of immigration detention and family separation as a deterrent runs counter to human rights standards and principles,\" she said. \"The child's best interest should always come first, including over migration management objectives or other administrative concerns.\"\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection has confirmed that more than 650 children were separated from parents at the border over a fortnight in May. US Ambassador Nikki Haley responded by accusing the UN of \"hypocrisy\" and said that \"neither the United Nations nor anyone else will dictate how the United States upholds its borders.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has tried to shift blame for family separations, claiming they were caused by bad legislation passed by Democrats. However, a fact check by the Associated Press news agency found there was no law requiring families to be separated at the border and that it was a new policy from the Trump administration.\n\nThe problem of children ending up in border immigration holding centers is not a new issue, as evidenced by photos of young people being held in a chain-link fence enclosure at a facility in Texas, which were recently tweeted by Jon Favreau, a speechwriter for President Barack Obama. However, it seems Mr. Favreau did not realize the images were taken in 2014, during Mr. Obama's presidency.",
    " Title: National Mourning as Santa Fe High School Shooting Claims Lives, Parkland Survivors Speak Out\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, at least 10 people were killed and another 10 injured in a shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas on Friday morning. This marks the deadliest school shooting since the February 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were murdered.\n\nThe details of the Santa Fe shooting are still emerging, but it is clear that students and possibly teachers have lost their lives. The 17-year-old shooter carried a shotgun and a revolver, and explosive devices were found at the school and the areas surrounding it.\n\nThe shooting has stirred a wave of grief and anger among the survivors of Parkland, who have become vocal advocates for gun control since the shooting at their high school. March for Our Lives, the organization founded by Parkland students, released a statement saying, \"This is not the price of freedom. This is the most fatal shooting since the one at our school, and tragedy like this will continue to happen unless action is taken.\"\n\nEmma Gonzalez, one of the most vocal Parkland activists, wrote on Twitter, \"You deserve more than Thoughts and Prayers, and after supporting us by walking out, we will be there to support you by raising up your voices.\"\n\nThe Parkland activists have reinvigorated the gun reform debate in the wake of the shooting at their high school, and they have seized on this rampage at Santa Fe as another example of lawmakers' failure to act. They also offered solidarity and support to the survivors of Santa Fe high school, who have joined this sorrowful club.\n\nThe students and faculty of Santa Fe High School are in the thoughts and prayers of the nation. The Parkland activists have vowed to support them in their fight for change. The aftermath of the shooting at Santa Fe High School will likely determine the future of the gun control movement in the United States.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for a \"War on Washington Waste\" in Prime-Time Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to regain the Republican party's reputation for fiscal responsibility, President Donald Trump has announced plans to deliver a nationally televised prime-time speech from the Oval Office, outlining an \"all-hands-on-deck War on Washington Waste.\" The move comes as polls show that Democrats are now more trusted on balancing the budget than Republicans, a shift that has been likened to losing an arm wrestling contest with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe President's speech is intended to declare a \"debt-spending emergency\" and commit to a comprehensive effort to eliminate wasteful spending. If successful, this initiative could significantly boost Trump's approval ratings, positioning him as a fiscal superhero. As a businessman president, Trump is well-positioned to identify and eliminate the hundreds of billions of dollars in unnecessary expenditures that have contributed to public disillusionment with the Washington political establishment.\n\nThe need for such a move is underscored by recent spending trends. The Congressional Budget Office has reported that the government is now spending $2 billion more than it takes in every day. This spending level, which exceeds $4 trillion annually, is a significant increase from the $3.4 trillion in federal revenues raised in 2018, a record high despite the tax cuts.\n\nIn a recent open letter, taxpayer watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com, signed by former Senator Tom Coburn and Tom Smith, urged the President to launch a \"waste war\" and provided examples of taxpayer dollars being squandered. The following table lists some of these instances:\n\n| Wasteful Expenditure                   | Amount |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|\n| Pentagon waste                         | $125B  |\n| Unnecessary military equipment        | $30B  |\n| Duplicate government programs          | $20B  |\n| Unnecessary federal buildings          | $15B  |\n| Unnecessary federal conferences        | $10B  |\n\nWhen presented with these examples, President Trump reportedly responded, \"I thought we already took care of this.\" However, the bureaucratic machinery ensured that these reforms were not implemented.\n\nFighting this war on waste will not be easy. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed the Grace Commission to root out waste, duplication, and inefficiency in the federal government. This commission, composed of private-sector businesspeople, identified $420 billion in bureaucratic overspending and called for the elimination of hundreds of unnecessary bureaus, agencies, and departments. Despite these recommendations, only about 10 to 15 percent were ever adopted, and many of the wasteful programs identified in the 1980s remain in place today.\n\nTrump has already taken steps towards this goal, calling for a 5 percent cut in the budget of every federal agency in 2019. OpenTheBooks advocates for Trump to require every agency to list all spending items of $100 or more on a government website, allowing for increased transparency and accountability. The President should also report monthly progress in cutting agency budgets to the American people.\n\nA successful crusade to eliminate wasteful spending could significantly boost Trump's reelection prospects. As Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and economic consultant at FreedomWorks, notes in his latest book \"Trumponomics,\" a government that is going broke while still spending tens of thousands of dollars on pianos, hundreds of millions on public relations firms, and billions on sending Social Security checks to the deceased is not serious about balancing the budget or spending taxpayer money with the same care they spend their own.",
    " Title: Historic Moment: Hillary Clinton Becomes First Woman Nominated by a Major U.S. Party for President\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a groundbreaking moment at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders officially nominated Hillary Clinton as the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of President of the United States. The nomination marks a significant milestone in American history, 240 years into the existence of the United States of America and nearly a century after the Constitution was amended in 1919 to give women the right to vote.\n\nClinton, appearing on video later Tuesday night, expressed her gratitude to her party and the delegates for their role in helping her make \"the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet.\" She addressed the American viewers, saying, \"If there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch, let me just say: I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.\"\n\nThe convention, chaired by Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, is making history with its diverse leadership. Ms. Fudge, the first African-American and first female mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, is joined at the helm by two other African-American women. Rev. Leah Daughtry, former chief of staff for the party's committee, is the chief executive officer of the convention for the second time, while Donna Brazile is the interim Democratic National Committee chair after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned last week, following an email scandal.\n\nThe speaker line-up last night included several trailblazers. Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who was the first Democratic woman to be elected to the Senate in 1987, nominated Clinton during the state roll call. Another of the evening's speakers was Madeleine Albright, the country's first female secretary of state, a position that Clinton held under Barack Obama. Albright was selected for that role in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nEmphasizing his wife's history of activism, not just for women, but for socioeconomic and racial equality, Mr. Clinton called her the \"best darn changemaker I've met in my entire life.\" He noted that she \"had done more positive change before she was 30 than many politicians do in a lifetime in office.\"\n\nThe theme of \"firsts\" will continue Wednesday night, as President Obama, the first African-American president, will offer his support of Clinton. On Monday, she received the support of another history-maker, one who occupies another role Clinton herself once held: Michelle Obama, the nation's first African-American first lady.\n\nThis report includes material from the Associated Press and Reuters.",
    " Title: Healthcare Debate Heats Up in Arkansas and New Hampshire as Midterm Elections Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, the healthcare debate is intensifying in Arkansas and New Hampshire, with both parties using the issue to attack their opponents. The focus is on the private option, a bipartisan plan that uses Medicaid dollars to buy private health insurance policies for low-income residents.\n\nRepublican Representative Tom Cotton, who is running against Democratic Senator Mark L. Pryor, is criticized for his anti-Obamacare stance, which could lead to the loss of health coverage for at least 155,000 of Arkansas' poorest residents. Similarly, Republican Scott Brown, vying for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire, is facing similar criticism for his skepticism towards a Concord compromise that also uses Medicaid dollars to buy commercial insurance for more than 50,000 residents.\n\nThe private option, a key, yet optional, pillar of President Obama's health care law, was a palatable way for some state Republicans to insure residents making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Now, Democrats are using this state-level success to paint Republican challengers into a corner, highlighting their opposition to Obamacare and the potential loss of health coverage for low-income residents.\n\nErik Dorey, spokesman for the Pryor campaign, stated, \"This is not an issue we\u2019ve been shy about talking about.\" Conservatives, however, argue that Democrats should not confuse state-level choices with success in congressional races. If Democratic incumbents dismiss Republican calls to repeal Obamacare, Republican challengers will counterpunch with stories of dropped health plans, higher premiums, and narrower doctor networks.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the federal focus on Obamacare is about the narrow networks, according to Greg Moore, state director for Americans for Prosperity in New Hampshire. The organization has run ads against incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, painting her as the cause of limited health care choices in the Granite State. Sen. Shaheen, however, has committed to assisting New Hampshire implement its Medicaid expansion plan, which will cover 58,000 people under the state's private option plan.\n\nThe potential repeal of the federal health care law would also repeal the state's new Medicaid law, according to Democratic strategist James Demers, which would leave about 50,000 New Hampshire residents without health coverage. This, he argues, does not make sense for those people or for those who would have to pay.\n\nArkansas pioneered the private option as a way to embrace Obamacare's Medicaid expansion last year, attracting enough GOP support to overcome the three-fourths voting threshold needed to pass appropriations in Little Rock. The legislature reauthorized the program in March, although the issue remains contentious. As of March 31, about 155,567 people, or roughly 70 percent of 225,000 eligible residents, had signed up for coverage under Arkansas' program.\n\nAnna Strong, health policy director at Arkansas Advocates for Children & Families, emphasized that these are families that are working, going to school, and supporting their families. The private option, she said, is a way to reduce uncompensated care that hospitals and other providers deliver.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, both candidates are presenting their views on the issue. Mr. Cotton, who voted to repeal President Obama's health care law, argues that Obamacare is such bad policy that it has made every state choose between multiple bad options. On the other hand, Mr. Brown, who has made his home in Rye, N.H. his main residence ahead of the campaign, argues that the state needs to balance its safety net with scrutiny of the federal government's promises. The debate is expected to continue as the midterm elections approach.",
    " Title: E.P.A.'s Carbon Regulation Offers Flexibility for Kentucky, Potential Short-term Disruptions\n\nIn a recent statement, Kentucky's energy department head expressed optimism about the state's ability to comply with the E.P.A.'s new carbon reduction rule, stating that the state was already moving in the direction of reduced coal usage. The E.P.A., in drafting the regulation, endorsed a flexible approach, setting an overall carbon reduction target for each state based on their energy portfolio. For Kentucky, the target is a 18% reduction of carbon pollution by 2030, reflecting the state's heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 93% of its electricity.\n\nThe state has the freedom to devise a plan to reach the goal, which could involve switching from coal to natural gas, developing renewable energy sources like solar, and encouraging the use of efficient home appliances and insulation to reduce demand. The implementation of these changes is not expected to happen immediately, as the E.P.A.'s proposal faces a political and legal onslaught.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the plan could lead to short-term disruptions, including to local economies tied to individual coal plants that might close, and in mining regions like eastern Kentucky, where the number of coal jobs is already at a historic low. The E.P.A. estimated that coal production in central Appalachia would fall by up to 37% as a result of its proposal.\n\nResidents like Dionna Sizemore of Burgin, a mother of two, who moved from Harlan County, the heart of Appalachian coal country, to escape dead-end prospects there, are concerned about the potential impact on their communities. \"It's going to be devastating if the power plant goes down,\" she said. \"We know the impact it's having on friends and family back home: people having to move off.\"\n\nThe exact number of Kentucky's 56 coal-fired generating units that might close is uncertain at this stage, as many have already installed costly upgrades to comply with earlier pollution rules.",
    " Title: New Evidence Casts Doubt on Andrew Tahmooressi's Border Crossing Story\n\nArticle:\n\nThe case of Andrew Tahmooressi, a former Marine who was arrested in Mexico on weapons charges in March, has become a controversial topic, with conservative media and the Tea Party advocating for his release. Tahmooressi's mother, Jill Tahmooressi, has been a frequent guest on Fox News, and 74 Tea Party Congress members have signed a letter demanding his release from a Mexican jail and urging the closure of the border until Tahmooressi is freed.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of Tahmooressi's story reveals inconsistencies and discrepancies. Some facts are not in dispute. Andrew Tahmooressi served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and was promoted to sergeant before being honorably discharged from the Marine Corps. A native of Weston, Florida, he had recently moved to the San Diego area to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder at the VA hospital in La Jolla.\n\nOn March 31, Tahmooressi parked his pickup truck and walked across the border at the El Chaparral crossing from San Ysidro, California, to Tijuana, Mexico. He spent the day in Tijuana and later that night returned to the American side of the border. Then he got into his truck and drove back across the border, where he was arrested at 10:30 p.m. by Mexican authorities.\n\nTahmooressi and his mother have consistently claimed that he was driving south on I-5 from La Jolla, on the way to have dinner with friends in San Ysidro, when he missed the last exit before the border and accidentally crossed into Mexico. However, new evidence has emerged that casts doubt on this story.\n\nFirstly, Tahmooressi now admits that he had parked his truck at a lot just north of the border earlier in the day and walked into Tijuana. This means when he walked back across the border to his truck, he was already as far south as it is possible to be and still be in the U.S.\n\nSecondly, the San Ysidro crossing is the busiest land border crossing in the world. It is large, well-marked, and brightly lit at night on both sides. Even had he been driving south on I-5, which we now know he was not, I-5 is a multilane freeway with numerous signs and ample opportunities to exit and turn around. Even had he somehow missed all of these, there are clearly marked turnaround lines only a few yards from the border.\n\nIn the past week, new evidence has turned up, including cellphone records and a hotel receipt, that casts even more doubt on Tahmooressi's story. Far from being unfamiliar with the San Ysidro crossing, as he originally claimed, cellphone and ATM records show that he had crossed the border five or six times in recent weeks. He has now admitted as much, saying he went to visit a Tijuana woman who works in the notorious Zona de Tolerancia, Tijuana's red light district, with whom he was developing a relationship.\n\nThanks to a receipt, a copy of which was published in the Tijuana news weekly Zeta, we now know that Tahmooressi had taken a room at the Hotel Nelson, a $24-a-night \"hot sheet\" hotel on the edge of the Zona de Tolerancia. His mother has confirmed that the receipt is authentic, but claims that Tahmooressi was afraid to spend the night there, which is why he returned to San Ysidro.\n\nIn the wake of this new evidence, Tahmooressi has secured new counsel to represent him, his third attorney in four months. Jill Tahmooressi, who had been ever present on Fox News and social media, has gone silent and returned to Florida. A press event scheduled for last week in San Diego to garner support for Tahmooressi was abruptly canceled without explanation. In the meantime, larger signs have been installed at approaches to the border warning that guns are illegal in Mexico and highlighting turnaround areas.\n\nI have a personal interest in this story because I know this border crossing well. The first time I crossed the border at San Ysidro was 37 years ago. I've crossed the border in both directions dozens of times since, by day and by night. I find it hard to believe, impossible to believe, that one could cross the border accidentally in either direction. This is not some dusty one-lane crossing between Presidio, Texas, and Ojinaga, where I've also crossed in both directions, and where in days past there might be nobody on duty on either side at night.\n\nIf Tahmooressi did not make a wrong turn and cross the border accidentally, as the preponderance of evidence suggests, why would he try to enter Mexico with a small arsenal and hundreds of rounds of ammunition?\n\nWhatever his reasons, one thing seems sure. Barring a decision by the Mexican government to pardon him, which seems unlikely at this point, it looks like Andrew Tahmooressi could spend a long time in a Mexican prison. It also seems certain that once again the conservative media machine has backed the wrong pony and sold its consumers a story that, to put it mildly, is simply not true. Whatever his intentions were, it's highly unlikely that this troubled young man suffering PTSD will find the help he needs in a Mexican prison.\n\nUpdate: At an evidentiary hearing last week, presided over by Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo, Tahmooressi's attorney, Fernando Benitez, began to lay out his defense. In Benitez's questioning of the border guards, it became clear that he believes the best hope for acquittal is to claim that proper procedures were not followed. Mexican authorities strenuously denied this claim, testifying that standard protocol was strictly followed, and that Tahmooressi's rights under Mexican law were protected at all times.\n\nBoth sides said the trial is likely to last at least until November. Tahmooressi's attorney has asked that a videotape be entered into evidence, hoping the tape, which the defense has not seen, will show the search of Tahmooressi's truck was somehow illegal. Experts on Mexican law say this is a long shot, but as Tahmooressi is facing a mandatory seven to 14 years in prison, his attorney told reporters his only hope was to secure an outright acquittal.\n\nIt is also expected that cellphone and ATM records, as well as additional evidence, including the hotel receipt, will be presented by prosecutors at the next hearing. After all of the evidence has been presented, it will be up to the judge to find Tahmooressi guilty or not guilty.",
    " Title: Turkey Defends Purchase of Russian S-400 Missile System Amidst US Sanctions Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkey's Defense Minister, Hulusi Akar, has defended the country's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system, stating that it was not a choice but a necessity due to the nation's perceived threats. The second shipment of equipment for the S-400 system was delivered on Saturday, despite strong urging from the United States to abandon the deal.\n\nIn a phone conversation with his American counterpart, Mark Esper, Akar emphasized that the acquisition of the controversial defense system does not signify a change in Turkey's strategic orientation. He reiterated that Turkey is under \"serious threat\" and the acquisition of S-400s is necessary, particularly in response to \"intensive attacks\" from the Syrian border.\n\nThe first equipment for the advanced air-defense system was delivered to the Murted airbase outside the capital on Friday, with further deliveries expected in the coming days. The US has yet to publicly respond to the Russian delivery.\n\nWashington's concerns revolve around potential data leaks regarding the US-built F-35 fighter jet if Ankara integrates the S-400s into its defenses. Akar reportedly informed Esper that Turkey is still assessing a bid to acquire the US Patriot air-defense system, and that a deterioration of bilateral relations would not serve the interests of either country.\n\nUS officials have urged Turkey to purchase Patriot missiles instead of the S-400s from Russia, but Ankara claims it was denied the opportunity to buy Patriots, leading it to seek other vendors. Russia reportedly offered a better deal, including technology transfers.\n\nThe US has stated that Turkey will not be allowed to participate in the program to produce hi-tech F-35 stealth fighter jets or buy them. Washington has repeatedly said the Russian missiles are incompatible with NATO systems and a threat to the F-35s.\n\nNATO, of which Turkey is a member, has expressed concern about the potential consequences of the S-400 purchase. Members of the US Congress have threatened sanctions, and Fitch Ratings downgraded Turkey's sovereign rating in response to the tensions.\n\nThe purchase has raised concerns in Western circles that Turkey may be drifting closer to Russia's sphere of influence. Ankara has maintained that the choice of defense equipment is a matter of national sovereignty. The extent to which Russia will allow the use of the S-400 system remains unclear, with some questioning the restrictions imposed in the deal.",
    " Title: Quote Approval: A Growing Trend in U.S. Politics and Journalism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the world of politics and journalism, the practice of quote approval has become increasingly common, with high-profile campaigns and government officials requiring that any statements made to the media be approved by their press offices before publication. This trend, while providing on-the-record quotes that journalists have long sought, has led to a loss of spontaneity and authenticity in interviews.\n\nThe Obama campaign, for instance, has a policy of requiring journalists to use only approved quotations when interviewing any of the five Romney sons. Similarly, Romney advisers often request that reporters seek their approval for any conversation they wish to include in an article. This practice is not limited to the political sphere; it is also prevalent in Washington and on the campaign trail.\n\nJim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, and David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, are among those who edit their quotes before approval. Stuart Stevens, a senior Romney strategist, is known for his clever lines, often quoting authors and historical figures, but these lines rarely make it past Mr. Stevens due to the approval process.\n\nMany journalists, when speaking anonymously, acknowledged the editing process, but none claimed it altered the meaning of the quotes. The changes were usually minor and seemingly unnecessary, they said. Those who spoke on the record expressed concern that the restrictions seem to be growing.\n\nMajor Garrett, a correspondent for The National Journal, said, \"It's not something I'm particularly proud of because there's a part of me that says, 'Don't do it, don't agree to their terms.' There are times when this feels like I'm dealing with some of my editors. It's like, 'You just changed this because you could!'\"\n\nSeveral news outlets, including Bloomberg, The Washington Post, Vanity Fair, Reuters, and The New York Times, have consented to interviews under such terms. Dean Baquet, managing editor for news at The New York Times, said, \"We don't like the practice. We encourage our reporters to push back. Unfortunately, this practice is becoming increasingly common, and maybe we have to push back harder.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign declined to comment on their media practices, while the White House has made a concerted effort to make more officials available to the news media. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said, \"We have a lot more people talking a lot more often now.\"\n\nBoth presidential campaigns are aware of the potential damage that unguarded comments can cause. President Obama's remark about the private sector being \"doing fine\" during a televised news conference was quickly turned into attack ads, while Eric Fehrnstrom's \"Etch A Sketch\" comment continues to haunt the Romney campaign.\n\nReporters who have covered the Obama presidency say the quote-approval process fits a pattern of the White House limiting its exposure in the media. Caren Bohan of Reuters, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said, \"The argument we make is that if a president or a candidate is out there more, I think these things are less likely to be as glaring.\"\n\nModern White Houses have long held \"background briefings,\" gatherings of top officials who speak to reporters under the condition that they are quoted anonymously. However, the restrictions have become broader over time, often bordering on the absurd. In 2007, Vice President Dick Cheney outed himself during a briefing intended to be anonymous during an overseas trip. Under President Obama, the insistence on blanket anonymity has grown to new levels.\n\nThe White House's latest innovation is a \"deep-background briefing,\" which involves groups of reporters and forbids the use of quotation marks or the identification of speakers. This practice, while providing a platform for senior administration officials to speak, has raised concerns about transparency and the authenticity of the information being presented.",
    " Title: Manchin to Meet with Senators Next Week in Push for Expanded Background Checks Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, is set to meet with senators next week in an effort to revive stalled gun control legislation, particularly the expanded background checks proposal he co-authored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. The key question Manchin wants answered is whether a \"minimal change\" to the compromise background check proposal would entice more senators to support it.\n\nSince the proposal failed to gain enough support in a vote last month, senators who voted against it have been confronted by outside proponents of expanded background checks during the current recess. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, has been the most high-profile target of such confrontations.\n\nErica Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a school principal slain in the Newtown massacre last December, questioned Ayotte at an event about the importance of her mother's death compared to inconveniencing gun sellers. Lafferty was sent to Ayotte's event by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of several gun control groups using the recess to take the gun control message out of Washington.\n\nThe pressure tactics appear to be working, with polls showing most Americans favoring some sort of new gun restrictions. In order to pass any legislation around the issue, gun control advocates need to find 60 votes in the Senate. Fifty-four senators backed the Manchin-Toomey amendment while 46 opposed it.\n\nManchin's prime targets to flip are all Republicans, including Ayotte, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. Proponents hope that if Murkowski flips, those in favor of tightening gun laws will have a good shot at getting her fellow Alaskan, Sen. Mark Begich, to do the same. However, a source close to Begich told CNN that it is very unlikely that he would change his vote.\n\nThe NRA is likely to be a powerful force in any deal on background checks, much like it was during the last debate. After the compromise background check proposal failed, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action released a statement decrying the \"misguided\" amendment. The NRA is expected to be a significant presence at its annual convention in Houston this weekend, with several potential 2016 GOP nominees in attendance, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin also spoke to the group.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, asked by one of the other victims of the Giffords shooting if he thought background checks would come up again, said there was a \"50-50\" chance that it would. A spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, one of the more high-profile Democrats to vote against the provision, told CNN that if such a bill were to come up, \"Max will evaluate it based on the feedback he gathers from the people of Montana, just as he always does with any legislation.\" However, she also said that in his first vote, \"Montanans told Max loud and clear they did not support new gun controls in the previous bill.\"",
    " Title: Global Financial Scandal Unveiled: The Panama Papers Expose Offshore Dealings of World Leaders and Celebrities\n\nArticle:\n\nA global storm of repercussions swept through capitals from Moscow to Washington and beyond on Monday, a day after the publication of the so-called \"Panama Papers\" revealed the offshore and potentially illegal financial dealings of numerous wealthy, famous, and powerful individuals worldwide. The leak, orchestrated by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), exposed financial schemes to create shell companies and hide billions of dollars in taxable income and profits by political figures past and present.\n\nIn several European nations, including France and Spain, prosecutors announced the opening of formal legal probes. The Obama administration stated that the global expose underscored the need for greater transparency in the global financial system. The effects were felt in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister David Cameron, who is hosting a global summit on financial corruption next month, faced criticism amid questions about the extent to which his late father may have avoided paying British taxes for three decades.\n\nNo corner of the world seemed untouched by the anonymous leak of confidential records from a high-powered Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records implicate leaders from Iceland, Ukraine, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, as well as political and business operatives from the U.S. French President Francois Hollande said the revelations from the estimated 11.5 million confidential files could be a boon for some nations and for the campaign to close loopholes and money-laundering schemes worldwide.\n\nAt least 29 individuals on Forbes magazine's 500 richest people list have been implicated in the files, which include financial spreadsheets, client records, corporate registries, passports, and other documents. The records expose apparent shell company dealings by a host of world-famous celebrities, such as Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi and his father. They raise questions about the financial maneuverings of many international leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's brother-in-law and Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nAustralian authorities claimed to be investigating more than 800 wealthy individuals for possible tax evasion linked to their alleged dealings with Mossack Fonseca. While the firm has vehemently denied any illegal activity, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela issued a statement saying his government has \"zero tolerance\" for illicit financial activities and would cooperate \"vigorously\" with any judicial investigation arising from the leak of the law firm's documents.\n\nDetails of the leak came to light Sunday through a slew of articles published by an international coalition of media outlets that worked with the ICIJ to examine Mossack Fonseca records. Major international banks, including HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank, were named as having worked with the Panamanian law firm to create offshore accounts.\n\nCarlos Sousa, a spokesman for the firm, told reporters, \"We have not once in nearly 40 years of operation been charged with criminal wrongdoing. We're proud of the work we do, notwithstanding recent and willful attempts by some to mischaracterize it.\" Blaming Mossack Fonseca for what people do with their companies, firm co-founder Ramon Fonseca told Panamanian television last month, would be like blaming an automaker \"for an accident or if the car was used in a robbery.\"\n\nThe Munich-based German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said it was offered the data more than a year ago through an encrypted channel by an anonymous source. The source sought unspecified security measures but no compensation, said Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the paper. Suddeutsche Zeitung ultimately shared the data with the ICIJ, which enlisted other partners and hundreds of investigative journalists from around the world to examine the files.\n\nThe ICIJ said, in total, the documents reference some 214,488 companies and 14,153 clients of the Panamanian firm. \"It allows a never-before-seen view inside the offshore world\u2014providing a day-to-day, decade-by-decade look at how dark money flows through the global financial system, breeding crime and stripping national treasuries of tax revenues,\" the ICIJ said in a statement on Sunday.",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation's Foreign Donations and the Clinton Family's Recent Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nAt the Clinton Global Initiative University held at Miami University in Coral Gables, Florida, former President Bill Clinton addressed the Clinton Foundation's decision to accept donations from foreign governments. The foundation's choice to accept such donations, particularly during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, has been a subject of criticism due to potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn reference to contributions from Middle Eastern nations such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Clinton defended these countries as friendly donors, stating that their governments and donations were instrumental in combating the self-declared Islamic State (ISIS). He asserted, \"I believe they do a lot more good than harm.\"\n\nHowever, it was reported by The Miami Herald that not all of the funds complied with recent fundraising pacts with the White House, despite President Clinton's defense of the countries. The former president acknowledged that a $500,000 contribution from the Algerian government was not in accordance with the agreement.\n\nThe article also touched upon Hillary Clinton's recent controversy surrounding her use of a personal email account during her tenure at the State Department. Critics argue that this lack of transparency, despite her request for the release of her emails, shows a lack of commitment to transparency. The Miami Herald outlined the difference between using a private account and a public server, stating that it was \"impossible to know which emails, if any, were deleted or not turned over.\"\n\nSo far, over 55,000 pages of correspondence have been reviewed. The Associated Press quoted Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short, who accused Hillary Clinton of \"hiding from the press and voters.\" He further stated that he believes she lives by her own set of ethical rules.\n\nIn an attempt to navigate recent PR issues, the Clintons have appointed Donna Shalala, Bill Clinton's former Secretary of Health and Human Services, as the next CEO of their foundation. Known for her candor in the Clinton administration, Shalala disagreed with President Clinton's decision to run the ill-fated health care task force, led by Hillary Clinton, from the White House.\n\nShalala, who has been president of Miami University for 14 years, is an accomplished fundraiser, having secured over $3 billion during her time with the university. During the event on Saturday, Hillary Clinton steered clear of the recent controversies, focusing instead on issues like the Affordable Care Act, Saturday's 50-year anniversary of the march in Selma, Alabama, and her work promoting equal rights for women. She is soon expected to release a report titled \"No Ceiling,\" part of the larger \"Not There\" program addressing gender inequality.",
    " Title: Trump Taps Brad Parscale as Campaign Manager for 2020 Re-election Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that was widely anticipated, President Donald Trump has appointed Brad Parscale, the digital media director of his 2016 campaign, to lead his re-election bid. The announcement was made on Tuesday, with the news initially broken by The Drudge Report, a conservative news website with significant influence within the White House.\n\nThe decision to hire a campaign manager three years before the election is unusual for a sitting president, but Trump had filed his intent to run for re-election shortly after his 2017 inauguration. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders had previously stated in June 2017 that Trump would run for re-election in 2020.\n\nEric Trump, one of the President's sons, praised Parscale as an \"amazing talent\" who was \"pivotal to our success in 2016.\" He added that Parscale had the \"family's complete trust\" and was the \"perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign.\" Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, also commended Parscale, stating that he was \"essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to the 2016 campaign.\"\n\nThe campaign's announcement also revealed plans to engage in the 2018 midterm election, providing candidates with general support, endorsements, and rallying the support of political grassroots by engaging Trump supporters in districts and states. The midterm elections will be crucial for the future of Trump's presidency, as the party in control of the presidency historically suffers sizable losses in the first election after winning the White House. Trump has already begun mentioning this trend in speeches, hoping to spur his supporters to buck history.\n\nParscale has remained active in his political operation since Trump took office. His Florida-based firm, Parscale Strategy, has a contract with the Republican National Committee to help grow its database of small donors. Prior to joining the Trump campaign in 2015, Parscale had no experience in politics. He worked for the Trump Organization for several years, designing websites and developing digital strategy for Trump businesses.\n\nDuring the tumultuous 2016 campaign, Parscale served as the digital director, but his role extended beyond that. He directed campaign spending on television ads and digital media, built a small dollar donor operation, and had significant influence on the overall campaign, working closely with then-Republican National Committee chief of staff Katie Walsh and the RNC's get-out-the-vote operation.\n\nParscale's digital advertising strategies, which included bringing Facebook employees into the campaign to better leverage social media, were not without controversy. During the campaign, Trump expressed his skepticism about digital media spending, angrily questioning Parscale about how campaign funds were being used. Despite this, Parscale remained focused on digital media spending, ultimately shifting funds to key states like Michigan and Wisconsin during the final week of the campaign, which he believed would be crucial for Trump's victory.\n\nParscale has maintained that he had no knowledge of the Russian operation to influence the 2016 campaign in favor of Trump and against Hillary Clinton. He has also distanced himself from Cambridge Analytica, a data firm he hired to work for the Trump campaign. Controversies surrounding Cambridge Analytica, including attempts to reach WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, have ensnared Parscale, but he has insisted that he had no knowledge of these actions and that the campaign never used Cambridge Analytica's raw data.\n\nThe Trump campaign's data analytics operation is under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and Parscale has given private testimony to the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russian meddling.",
    " Title: Clearview AI's Client List Stolen in Data Breach, Raising Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Clearview AI, the controversial facial-recognition company, has reported a data breach that resulted in the theft of its entire client list. The breach, first reported by The Daily Beast, has raised concerns about the privacy of individuals and the potential misuse of the technology.\n\nClearview AI's facial-recognition tool allows law enforcement agencies to use a photo of a person and search it against a database of billions of images scraped from social media to identify suspects. The breach is notable as the company has been secretive about its clientele.\n\nTor Ekeland, Clearview AI's attorney, confirmed the breach in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588. Ekeland stated that the breach did not result from a hack into Clearview's servers but from a \"flaw\" that gave someone unauthorized access to the company's client list.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that the company's customers included hundreds of law-enforcement agencies across the US and Canada, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Clearview AI is also reported to have received inquiries from law-enforcement agencies worldwide.\n\nThe breach could lead to a broader backlash against the company, according to analysts. Kjell Carlsson, an analyst with Forrester specializing in AI, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"It will likely bring the public awareness, and mistrust, of facial recognition to a new level.\"\n\nAlbert Liu, CEO of AI startup Kneron, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the fact that Clearview maintains a database of faces raises inherent security concerns, especially after this breach. \"One of the major risks with AI software, despite how groundbreaking it is, is that it relies on these massive databases and the amount of sensitive information stored on these platforms,\" Liu said.\n\nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other companies have threatened legal action against Clearview AI, telling the company to stop scraping public images from their platforms to build its face database. Clearview's founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That responded by saying that gathering publicly accessible photos is protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nAs the investigation into the data breach continues, the public and privacy advocates will be closely watching Clearview AI's response and actions moving forward.",
    " Title: Christian Right Joins Immigration Reform Movement: A Shift in Allies for Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Christian right has emerged as a new ally in the ongoing fight for comprehensive immigration reform. Traditionally, religious conservatives have either stayed on the sidelines or opposed reform initiatives. However, this time around, they are actively engaging in the debate, advocating for change from the pulpit, in private meetings with lawmakers, and publicly.\n\nRalph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, noted a marked shift in the support for immigration reform among social conservatives. Reed's group released a letter on Tuesday outlining broad goals for reform, including keeping families together, reforming the visa system, and securing the border.\n\nHigh-profile Christian leaders are also lending their support. Mathew Staver, Vice President of Liberty University, and Focus on the Family, which has historically focused on issues like opposing abortion rights and gay marriage, are now backing immigration reform for the first time. Focus on the Family is even using its radio broadcast, which reaches millions, to push its message.\n\nTom Minnery of Focus on the Family stated, \"The issues had been so demagogued for the last five or six years, it was hopeless to get seriously into this. It seems the time is better. The time has changed...That's why we've become more active.\"\n\nSocial conservatives are targeting GOP offices, aiming to provide political cover for lawmakers in the South, West, and Midwest who are concerned about potential backlash at the ballot box in 2014.\n\nRichard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention noted, \"Many of the most hostile critics got beat, a fact not lost on the other House members. I think there's a bigger coalition in the House for immigration reform than people think.\"\n\nWhile the unity among the groups may face challenges as the political battle heats up, particularly on contentious issues like border enforcement, citizenship, and immigration rights for gays and lesbians, the focus for now seems to be on raising visibility among social conservatives.\n\nA coalition of nearly a dozen groups, including Bread for the World, Esperanza, Christian Community Development Association, and the National Association of Evangelicals, has launched a 40-day \"I was a stranger\" campaign, asking parishioners to read a Bible verse dealing with immigrants each day.\n\nNoel Castellanos of CCDA stated, \"We've moved beyond the religious leadership in our country on the evangelical side to begin influencing more of the pews. We need to inform them and expose them the way we did with our pastors.\"\n\nThis newfound alliance could potentially provide the political cover necessary for Republicans to vote yes on a deal, significantly altering the dynamics of the immigration reform debate.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidate Cory Booker Proposes Comprehensive Clemency Program for Nonviolent Drug Offenders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the inherent inequality in the United States' justice system, Democratic presidential hopeful Cory Booker has announced plans to release thousands of nonviolent drug offenders from federal prisons. The New Jersey senator, who is one of two dozen Democrats vying for their party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election, aims to use the president's pardon power to implement a sweeping clemency program.\n\nBooker's proposal, which builds upon his longstanding focus on criminal justice reform, targets individuals serving \"unjust and excessive sentences\" for drug crimes, including marijuana-related offenses. The plan is designed to address the disproportionate impact of the War on Drugs on minorities and low-income individuals.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, according to researchers. The U.S. constitution grants the president essentially unlimited power to offer clemency \u2013 either a full pardon or a commutation, which shortens a sentence while the conviction stands.\n\nUnder Booker's plan, more than 11,000 people serving time for marijuana offenses would be eligible for clemency. The campaign noted that while using marijuana is roughly equally prevalent across races, black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested as white people for its use.\n\nIn addition, nearly 4,000 inmates serving the kind of minimum sentences now reduced under the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed into law last year by President Donald Trump, could receive clemency, as well as prisoners serving more time as a result of sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine.\n\nBooker's proposal calls for an executive panel to review eligible cases. While the panel would start from a presumption of recommending clemency, it would decline any cases in which the defendant poses a threat to the public. The process would be more efficient than the current system, which includes a series of steps through the Justice Department and the White House Counsel's office.\n\nOther Democratic candidates have weighed in on clemency, most notably U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has proposed establishing an advisory board to streamline the process and focus primarily on drug offenders. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California, like Klobuchar a former prosecutor, has also said she would look to pardon low-level drug offenders.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama launched a more limited clemency initiative that encouraged certain nonviolent drug offenders serving mandatory minimum sentences to apply.\n\nBooker is currently averaging between 2 and 3 percent in public polling, putting him around seventh place in the crowded field of candidates.",
    " Title: Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Lend Minimal Amounts Under $500 Billion Coronavirus Aid Fund, Oversight Report Reveals\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A new report from a congressional oversight panel reveals that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have lent hardly any money under a $500 billion fund created by the economic rescue law in response to the coronavirus crisis. The report, issued Monday by the Congressional Oversight Commission, contains mostly questions about how the Treasury fund is going to function.\n\nThe Treasury fund, which is being used to guarantee new, expansive Federal Reserve lending programs to companies, states, and cities that could be leveraged to reach as much as $4.5 trillion, has so far only disbursed $37.5 billion under one of the new Fed programs, a lending fund likely to be tapped by large public companies.\n\nThe report also states that the economic rescue law, also known as the Cares Act, imposed a number of restrictions on the use of the Treasury fund. For example, none of the $500 billion can support an entity in which top Trump administration officials, members of Congress, or certain family members have a controlling interest.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is setting up a Main Street Lending Program intended to facilitate lending by banks to small and medium-size businesses. The program would support lending up to $600 billion, with Treasury providing $75 billion to offset any potential losses. That program also has not disbursed any money, the report said.\n\nThe oversight panel, which still does not have a chairman, has four other members appointed by congressional leaders. The commission's 17-page report asks questions about how Treasury and the Fed will assess the program's success or failure, and how they will isolate the effects of this program from other factors, including other federal and state relief measures.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is pledging to reveal names and other details of entities that borrow from emergency programs the central bank has set up to offset the economic hit from the pandemic. In prepared testimony for a Tuesday congressional hearing, Powell says the Fed will disclose amounts borrowed and interest rates levied under programs to provide credit for large corporations, state and local governments, and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe economic rescue law includes $46 billion to make loans and loan guarantees to the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic as air traffic has come to a near halt. None of that money has been disbursed.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to testify along with Powell on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony, Mnuchin states that the Paycheck Protection Program to provide forgiveable loans to small businesses has processed more than 4.2 million loans worth over $530 billion. The program is working \"to keep tens of millions of hardworking Americans on the payroll,\" Mnuchin says. The loans don't have to be paid back as long as the borrower uses 75% of the money to cover payroll.",
    " Title: Investigations Intensify as Turkey Searches Saudi Consulate for Evidence in Khashoggi Disappearance\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators in Turkey have been searching the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul for traces of \"toxic materials\" in connection with the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, two weeks after he was last seen entering the consulate, according to Turkish media reports. The searches come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks regarding the matter.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed some details about the consulate search while speaking to journalists on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, citing Turkey's NTV. The AP also cited a high-level Turkish official as saying that during the search, \"certain evidence\" was found by police, proving that Khashoggi was killed at the consulate. However, the official did not elaborate on the nature of the evidence.\n\nThe announcements came as Khashoggi's family released a statement expressing their concern over his disappearance. The activist and opinion columnist, who was a critic of the Saudi government, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2, reportedly to obtain documents related to his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has repeatedly claimed Khashoggi walked out of the building on his own, is now reportedly considering whether to say that rogue intelligence operatives murdered him by mistake during an interrogation.\n\n\"We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago, when he disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul,\" the family's statement said. \"Our family is traumatized and yearns to be together during this painful time. The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.\"\n\nIn addition to the consulate search that took place on Monday, a Turkish official revealed on Tuesday that the top Saudi diplomat's home in Istanbul will also be investigated, according to the Associated Press. The official did not say when the search will happen, but Turkish media has reported that the diplomat, Mohammed al-Otaibi, left the country on an afternoon flight just hours after it was announced.\n\nSurveillance footage leaked to Turkish media showed that shortly after Khashoggi disappeared, vehicles were seen moving between the consulate and the diplomat's home, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPompeo, who is currently meeting with Saudi King Salman over the Khashoggi case, arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday. \"The Secretary and the King discussed a number of regional and bilateral issues,\" State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said. \"The Secretary also thanked the King for his commitment to supporting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation of Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance.\"\n\nPompeo also met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is accused of ordering the detention of Khashoggi. \"We are strong and old allies,\" he told Pompeo. \"So we face our challenges together, the past, the day of, tomorrow.\"",
    " Title: Jared Kushner Leads Reshuffling in Donald Trump's Transition Team\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the transition process, Donald Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, is reportedly at the center of internal disputes within President-elect Trump's transition team, according to multiple sources speaking to CNN. Despite Trump's tweet Tuesday night describing the process as \"very organized,\" sources suggest that Kushner has been involved in a series of changes, including the departure of former Congressman Mike Rogers.\n\nRogers, who had been working on the transition team for months, was informed on Monday that he was being removed from the team, according to a source familiar with the transition. This move is part of an effort to replace team members associated with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who previously headed up the transition team's efforts until being replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\nRogers, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee while in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with expertise in national security, described his time with the transition team as a \"privilege\" in a statement Tuesday. He added that he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Pence and \"the stellar new leadership team.\"\n\nKushner's role in the reshuffling has reportedly led to friction among allies, as his father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Chris Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering, and illegal campaign contributions. While some sources describe the changes as a \"purge\" of Christie associates, others caution that such a characterization is \"overblown.\"\n\nThe Obama White House Tuesday night stated that it is moving forward with a broader sharing of information as the President-elect's transition team provides the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. The internal disagreements within the transition team, mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues, have been described as a \"knife fight\" by sources speaking to CNN.",
    " Title: Congress Averts Government Shutdown, Temporarily Funds Federal Agencies Through January 19\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. Congress on Thursday managed to avert a government shutdown, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide temporary funding for federal agencies until January 19. The House of Representatives and Senate passed the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively.\n\nWith lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until January 3, the House and Senate rushed to pass the bill. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that will already be three months old. They will try to pass an \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill to fund the government from January 19 through September 30.\n\nNegotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment, and \u201canti-terrorism\u201d activities. Fiscal hawks are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt.\n\nHowever, some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion.\n\nWith the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as \u201cDreamers.\u201d In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the House\u2019s 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate\u2019s 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure.\n\nShortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re really tired of tomorrow.\u201d He was referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States, and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure.\n\nTrump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and several states hit by this year\u2019s hurricanes or wildfires.\n\nThe temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service.\n\nThe plan also would extend the National Security Agency\u2019s expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through January 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard, and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until January 19 at fiscal 2017 levels.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul Ryan Breaks with Donald Trump, Refuses to Endorse Presumptive Republican Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Speaker Paul Ryan has decided not to endorse Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential election. This move, made public in a CNN interview on Thursday, marks a significant departure from the standard line Ryan has maintained for months, that he would support the party's nominee.\n\nOn Wednesday, just a day after Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Ryan convened his top advisers for a call to discuss the way forward. The speaker, who was busy raising funds for House Republicans, had not anticipated Trump's swift victory. Ryan's team was preparing for a contested convention in Cleveland, where he is slated to serve as chairman.\n\nIn the CNN interview, Ryan expressed his concerns about Trump's adherence to conservative values and principles. He stated, \"I think conservatives want to know, does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?\"\n\nRyan's decision to go public with his reservations about Trump was met with surprise by the Trump campaign. On Thursday, campaign sources said advisers had reached out to Ryan's office with an invitation for a one-on-one meeting to discuss the fall campaign and the party's agenda. However, the invitation was not accepted, and the Trump campaign was informed that Ryan was not ready to support his agenda.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump relationship will now take center stage, potentially forcing Trump to prove his mettle on Capitol Hill. The Trump campaign has already started arranging meetings in Washington, and Ryan's team is open to an audience with the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nThis decision could provide a measure of cover for the over 200 Republicans up for reelection, particularly those in swing districts. Many of these representatives think Trump is too politically crude to represent the party. Ryan's move comes just hours after Trump tweeted a picture of himself eating a taco bowl, an attempt at reaching out to the Hispanic voting bloc, which was not well-received by GOP brass.\n\nRyan's decision is based on opposition to Trump's principles, not any particular policy, according to a source familiar with his thinking. This move could be part of an effort to rebuild the party if Republicans lose the White House this fall, or it could signal Ryan's reluctance to launch a presidential bid in 2020.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's positioning on the party's standard-bearer remains more muddled compared to Ryan's clear stance. McConnell has committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, but has not endorsed Trump yet.\n\nRyan is also preparing to roll out a separate governing agenda for the fall, a clear sign that he believes the substance of the 2016 contest does not represent the party he has spent 20 years trying to build. Ryan emphasized, \"The future of America is on the line. No one should support Hillary Clinton. Let's make that clear.\" He added, \"To be the party and climb the final hill and win, we need a standard-bearer that can unify all conservatives and the wings of the party and then go to the country with an appealing agenda that's appealing to the Democrats. We have work to do on the front. The nominee has to lead in that effort.\"",
    " Title: White House Proposes $15 Billion in Federal Spending Cuts, Including CHIP Program\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014The White House will send a proposal to the House Tuesday to cut federal spending by $15 billion, roughly half of which would come from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a senior administration official said Monday. The proposal, which seeks to rescind funds that were authorized in previous fiscal years but not spent, is a shift from earlier discussions about rescinding funds that had been approved as part of a sweeping, $1.3 trillion spending bill enacted in March.\n\nThe most controversial element of the proposal coming Tuesday is likely to be the $7 billion in proposed cuts to the CHIP program, which enjoys strong, bipartisan support. The federal-state program provides health coverage to more than eight million low-income, uninsured children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe White House proposal would rescind $7 billion from that program, of which $5 billion would come from funds where the authority to spend them has expired. An additional $2 billion would come from a contingency fund that isn't projected to be tapped by states, the senior administration official said.\n\nThe White House said it believed the cuts wouldn't affect the insurance program's operations, but Democrats didn't agree. Democrats said that the contingency funds were necessary in case CHIP enrollment were to surge unexpectedly and the program, whose funding isn't open-ended, suddenly needed more money.\n\nUnder the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, President Donald Trump will be able to temporarily freeze funding for 45 days, but can't rescind it on his own unless Congress agrees. His proposal will head first to the House. Once drafted into a bill, the rescissions package can be considered under an expedited process and would only need a simple majority to pass both chambers.\n\nIn addition to the CHIP program, the White House also plans to propose cutting funds that were previously authorized for two technology loan programs, rolling back funds set aside for responding to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, now declared over, for a railroad unemployment-insurance-benefits program that expired, and for Hurricane Sandy-related emergency watershed programs.\n\nSome lawmakers doubted that rolling back funds that haven't been spent wouldn't affect agencies. \"As a general rule, once Congress has agreed to appropriate funds, they should remain available to those agencies for their intended purposes,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). However, he said he wanted to look at the specifics of Mr. Trump's proposal.\n\nThe White House proposal is the first in a series of proposals to cut funding, with the administration planning to propose rescinding money from the March deal in a future proposal. The senior administration official said Monday the rescissions proposal headed for Capitol Hill Tuesday would be the first in a series of proposals to cut funding.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Vice Presidential Debate: A Closer Look at the Claims and Reality\n\nArticle:\n\nThe vice presidential debate on Tuesday night saw both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine making several claims, some of which may not stand up to scrutiny. Here is a look at some of the key claims made during the debate and how they compare with the facts:\n\nREPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: \"The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling. The national debt currently stands at $19.6 trillion. This increase largely reflects efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession. Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Clinton plan, with its tax increases, would increase the gross debt\u2014both privately and publicly held\u2014by $450 billion over 10 years. This is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.\n\nAs for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion\u2014nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.\n\nDEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: \"Donald Trump does not have a plan.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Clinton also does not have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing. She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS \"on its home turf\" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.\n\nIt's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.\n\nPENCE, calling Clinton the \"architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,\" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a \"failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief, and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.\n\nPENCE: \"We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: The coal industry's woes do not come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas. A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources, and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\n\nStill, the Obama administration has implemented rules that are not making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.\n\nPENCE, saying he's proud that \"the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Immigration Stance: A Conservative Approach to a Polarizing Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent profile published in The Weekly Standard, Andrew Ferguson sheds light on Jeb Bush's political history, suggesting that the former Florida governor is more conservative than both the national press corps and right-leaning activists perceive. Ferguson posits that Bush, in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, may be presenting a moderate image, particularly before the press and the wealthy Republican elites.\n\nWhile Ferguson's analysis largely focuses on Bush's record in Florida, it is worth noting that Bush's stance on immigration reform, a topic Ferguson does not delve into, does not align neatly with this conservative-moderate dichotomy. To gain a better understanding of Bush's immigration views, one can refer to a video from his Right to Rise PAC, titled \"Conservative,\" which showcases highlights from Bush's speech at CPAC.\n\nIn the video, Bush, after expressing standard conservative views, makes a notable departure: \"There is no plan to deport 11 million people,\" the video shows Bush saying. \"We should give them a path to legal status where they work, where they do not receive government benefits, where they do not break the law, where they learn English, and where they make a contribution to our society.\"\n\nThis statement, in contrast to the immigration stances of other likely 2016 Republican candidates, indicates a more nuanced approach to immigration reform. For instance, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has publicly stressed his opposition to \"amnesty,\" while privately expressing support for a path to legal status, as reported by Dara Lind in a recent article.\n\nBush, however, is taking a different approach, not only publicly advocating for legal status but also arguing that it is the true conservative position. By doing so, Bush's position-taking is not merely rhetorical; it represents a genuine attempt to shift his party and its base from their current default view, which is opposition to immigration reform that legalizes the status of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe implications of this stance are significant. By challenging his party on one high-profile issue, Bush has to do less to seem moderate elsewhere, in the eyes of both the press and activists, when the general election rolls around. This strategy allows Bush to present himself as a moderate to the media while maintaining his conservative credentials among the Republican base, as his overall governing record is, as both liberals and conservatives agree, very little moderate.\n\nIn an interesting sense, Bush's immigration position lets him have things both ways\u2014it provides the media with a peg to hang the moderate label on Bush, but as the right learns more about his record, it allows him to tout that he is, otherwise, a down-the-line conservative. This approach could prove to be a strategic move in the upcoming 2016 presidential race, as it allows Bush to navigate the polarized political landscape while maintaining a strong connection with his conservative base.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Free Speech at United Nations, Emphasizes Importance of Freedom of Expression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a high-profile speech to the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama delivered a robust defense of the value of freedom of expression, addressing the controversy surrounding an anti-Muslim video that sparked protests across the Muslim world.\n\nWhile Obama's forceful endorsement of free speech rights was directed at leaders of many regimes that repress critics, the president's message seemed intended for a domestic audience as well. He aimed to quell criticism from Republicans who have accused him of failing to stand up for \"American values.\"\n\n\"I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video,\" Obama told world leaders and delegates gathered for the United Nations General Assembly. \"The answer is enshrined in our laws: Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech.\"\n\nObama explained that in the United States, numerous publications provoke offense, and yet blasphemy against the most sacred beliefs is not banned. He accepted that people would call him awful things every day, and he would always defend their right to do so.\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and others in the GOP sharply criticized Obama for expressing sympathy with the demonstrators' outrage and not immediately standing up for free speech.\n\nObama's forceful defense of free speech rights included a civics-class-style explanation of why allowing offensive speech and confronting it with other speech is preferable to trying to ban objectionable speech outright.\n\n\"Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views\u2014even views that we disagree with,\" he said.\n\nThe president argued that efforts to suppress free expression are increasingly ineffective in an interconnected world.\n\n\"I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech. Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president made little mention of Afghanistan during his speech, devoting a clause to a recent suicide bombing and a sentence to promising that \"America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014.\"\n\nObama began his address with a tribute to Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, who was killed earlier this month along with three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The president sought to harness sympathy and outrage over the attack by describing it as a strike on diplomats of all nations and on the entire civilized world.\n\n\"The attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded,\" Obama said. \"If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common.\"\n\n\"Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations,\" Obama said.",
    " Title: Rubio's Shift on Immigration: From Advocate to Hardliner\n\nArticle:\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Two years ago, immigration activist Gaby Pacheco received a call from Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who was seeking advice on a plan to help individuals like her - immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Now, Pacheco is taken aback by Rubio's hardened stance on illegal immigration, as the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate has abandoned the comprehensive bill he co-authored and is advocating for an end to the Obama administration program that allows Pacheco to remain in the U.S.\n\n\"It's another Marco Rubio that I just don't know,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAfter experiencing a decline in political standing among conservatives who were critical of his immigration advocacy, Rubio is now focusing on border security, a stance more in line with the GOP activists who hold significant influence in the selection of a White House nominee. Last month, Rubio urged President Barack Obama not to implement measures that would shield millions of people who entered the U.S. illegally, stating that Congress should first \"make real progress on stemming the tide of illegal immigration.\"\n\nImmigrant advocates argue that, by emphasizing border security and dismissing his own bill, Rubio is effectively switching sides in the heated immigration debate. Rubio's aides maintain that the senator has consistently emphasized border security and insisted on tougher enforcement measures as a condition for his Senate vote last year.\n\nThe shift in Rubio's stance comes as potential 2016 rivals, such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who voted against the overhaul that Rubio co-authored, take hard-line stances on immigration.\n\nRubio has been visiting South Carolina and Iowa, early-voting states in the 2016 nominating calendar where immigration is a significant issue for White House hopefuls. Rubio was the only potential GOP candidate who co-authored the immigration bill, which would strengthen border security while offering a path to citizenship for many of the 11.5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nNow, in a sign of the changing political climate, the party committee working to elect Republicans to the Senate is using the bill, which more than a dozen Republicans support, in ads to attack Democrats as pro-\"amnesty.\" The bill remains unpopular among some in the Republican base, and Rubio's popularity has declined in public polls.\n\nLast month, Rubio won applause from conservatives in South Carolina when he scolded immigration activists for interrupting his speech at a Republican fundraiser. \"You're doing harm to your own cause,\" he told the protesters, who identified themselves as immigrants brought illegally to the country as children. \"You don't have a right to illegally immigrate to the United States.\"\n\nIn a series of appearances on Fox News and conservative talk radio, Rubio has embraced GOP calls to bolster security and deploy the National Guard along the Mexican border to respond to the arrival of tens of thousands of Central Americans.\n\nDuring a recent tour through central Florida, an important swing-voting region with a fast-growing Latino population, Rubio told reporters in English and Spanish that his emphasis on border security is an acknowledgement that House conservatives do not support a comprehensive immigration bill.\n\n\"The votes aren't there,\" Rubio said. \"You're going to have to deal with the border first. Otherwise, we're going to continue to beat our head against a wall here for another decade without any changes or any progress being made.\"\n\nAt the Orange County Republican Party's Lincoln Day dinner, Rubio's argument resonated with many activists who propelled him to the Senate four years ago.\n\n\"Leaders need to step up, and he stepped up to the plate,\" said Bertica Cabrera Morris, who chaired Rubio's campaign along Florida's Interstate 4 corridor, a crucial stretch of swing counties. \"I think he did as much as he could.\"\n\nHowever, the tough talk also threatens to undercut Rubio's credibility with Hispanic voters, a critical factor for the Cuban-American lawmaker in a country that has yet to elect a Latino president.\n\nRubio has often felt the competing pressures from the Hispanic community and the conservative activists who elevated him to the national stage. As a state lawmaker, he supported legislation to protect field workers and to extend in-state tuition to college students who entered the U.S. illegally. But in 2010, as he surged toward a Senate seat as a tea party favorite, Rubio derided a path to citizenship as \"code for amnesty.\"\n\nTwo years later, he softened his stance, floating a proposal to give legal status to children of some living in the U.S. without legal permission. \"No one's making the argument that these kids have a legal right to be here. They don't have a legal claim,\" he told The Miami Herald. \"I would make the argument, however, that they have a claim on our conscience.\"\n\nRubio spent months meeting with Pacheco and other immigrant advocates. Obama pre-empted those efforts by announcing an executive action to temporarily defer deportations and grant work permits to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nRubio recently said he never formally introduced his own legislation because he could not figure out how to \"address the challenges that those children are facing without creating that incentive for more people to come.\"\n\nWhile the Obama program is only open to certain young immigrants who entered the country before June 15, 2007, Rubio argued that the administration should stop accepting new applicants to \"prevent that sort of message and ambiguity from getting back to Central America or any other country.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he supported a House bill that would effectively phase out Obama's executive order, however, Rubio cited concerns about the \"unintended consequences\" for youths who have already come forward and obtained work permits. Nevertheless, he said, \"I certainly think at some point that will have to end too.\"",
    " Title: Democrats' Refusal to Review Unredacted Mueller Report Raises Questions About Motives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move towards transparency, Attorney General William Barr allowed a dozen members of Congress, six Democrats and six Republicans, to access the Mueller report with most of the redactions removed. However, prior to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Barr last week, only two lawmakers had taken advantage of the opportunity, and both were Republicans.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Representative Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, reviewed the unredacted information, and both said the new details did not change their assessment of the report in any way.\n\nDespite being some of the most vocal critics of the way Barr handled the release of the report, none of the top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, and even the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, have reviewed the less redacted version of the report prior to the attorney general testifying in front of their panels.\n\nThe Democrats' unanimous refusal to inspect the unredacted report, despite their demands for its release, raises questions about their true motives in making such a fuss about the release of the full report. The Democrats had evidently \"boycotted en masse\" the opportunity to review the unredacted report because they wanted Barr to also remove legally required redactions of grand jury material and grant access to a broader array of lawmakers.\n\nHowever, it is now abundantly clear, if it was not already, that the Democrats no longer truly believe there is anything significant hiding behind the redactions in the special counsel report. If they did then it would be grossly negligent of the Democrats to deliberately keep themselves in the dark about all those hidden details.\n\nIn fact, it increasingly appears that the Democrats would prefer that Barr never release the unredacted report at all. So long as the redactions are in place, they can keep making baseless insinuations about a nonexistent cover-up. That is why the Democrats who have a chance to do not want to read the unredacted report because without actually seeing it, they do not have to lie about it to fit their narrative. They can let their imaginations run wild and simply claim ignorance in case the truth ever does get out.\n\nAttorney and commentator Madison Gesiotto serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign.

    " Title: Obama Shifts Focus to Middle Class, Economic Future in Major Economic Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to reset his campaign and address the struggling economy, President Barack Obama delivered a major economic address on Thursday, shifting the onus on voters to break the partisan deadlock in Washington. The speech, which took place at Cuyahoga Community College outside Cleveland, focused on the President's familiar theme of championing the middle class and contrasting his economic vision with that of his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.\n\nObama's speech came in response to Romney's stinging rebuke of the President's economic record, delivered earlier in the day in Cincinnati. Romney accused the President of being \"long on words and short on action\" with unemployment figures still above 8 percent.\n\nThe President acknowledged the economy as his chief liability come November, stating, \"This election is about our economic future.\" He claimed that Romney's economic plan consists mainly of trillions of dollars more in tax cuts, severe spending cuts, and lifting regulations on corporations. However, he asserted that he is the only candidate committed to protecting middle-income workers and saving programs they depend on.\n\nIn his speech, Obama also addressed the still-struggling economy, stating, \"We were told that huge tax cuts \u2014 especially for the wealthiest Americans \u2014 would lead to faster job growth. We were told that fewer regulations \u2014 especially for big financial institutions and corporations \u2014 would bring about widespread prosperity. We were told that it was OK to put two wars on the nation's credit card, that tax cuts would create enough growth to pay for themselves. That's what we were told. So how did this economic theory work out?\"\n\nThe President's re-election campaign billed the speech as a pivotal moment for the campaign, a way to regain the offensive after a rough couple of weeks following May's dismal jobs report, Governor Scott Walker's victory in the Wisconsin recall election, and the President's Friday comments that \"the private sector is doing fine.\"\n\nThe President made light of his recent political misstep at the beginning of his speech, saying, \"Over the next five months, this election will take many twists and many turns, polls will go up, and polls will go down. There will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about. You may have heard I recently made my own unique contribution to that process.\"\n\nDespite criticism in recent weeks from high-profile Democrats that the President must do more than blame former President George W. Bush and the economic crisis he inherited, the President hewed closely to that theme in Thursday's speech. In painstaking detail, he denounced the Bush-era economic and policy choices that he said Romney and Republicans support, which led to the global economic crisis of late 2008.\n\nThe President's speech was met with chants of \"Four more years\" and \"Fired up and ready to go\" from the crowd of roughly 1,500. However, there were few rousing applause lines, and at times, the hour-long remarks seemed to ramble and repeat various refrains the President has been pushing for months, including his desire to \"double-down on\" spending on clean energy, technology, infrastructure, and education as a way to help boost the economy.\n\nBoth Obama's and Romney's campaigns have poured more money into Ohio than other states, and their dueling visits on Thursday show just how strongly the two are competing for the state's 18 electoral votes. Ohio has played a critical role in determining the winner in the past few presidential contests. President Obama won the state in 2008, and President Bush took it in 2004. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio.\n\nPolls show the two men running neck and neck in Ohio with President Obama ahead by a statistically insignificant 1 percentage point. However, Ohio, whose unemployment rate is 7.4 percent \u2014 nearly a full point below the national average \u2014 is faring better than many other areas of the country, and the Obama team is eager to credit the auto bailout as one of the reasons.\n\n\"When my opponent was arguing that we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American ingenuity, and today our auto industry is back,\" President Obama said. The President planned to spend the evening at a star-studded fundraiser in Manhattan at the home of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick and co-hosted by Anna Wintour.",
    " Title: FBI Documents Reveal Clinton's Uncertain Recollections in Email Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant release of documents on Friday, it was revealed that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, provided numerous instances of \"I can't recall\" during her extensive interview with the FBI regarding her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State. The documents, which concluded the FBI's investigation without recommending criminal charges, detailed Clinton's inability to recall specific emails and briefings on handling classified information.\n\nThe documents, which did not provide significant new information about the federal government's probe, have created further distractions for Clinton and her campaign as voters continue to question her trustworthiness. Clinton, who was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, could not recall specific emails but also could not recall the details of briefings on handling classified information.\n\nThe FBI documents reveal that Clinton could recall being briefed on Specific Access Program (SAP) information, but she could not recall any specific briefings on how to handle information associated with the SAPs. In another entry, the FBI addresses Clinton's use of her BlackBerry after being advised about the risks of using her personal device. Clinton said she requested a secured BlackBerry while at State but could not recall why they were unable to provide one.\n\nIn December 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion from a fall and later developed a blood clot. The documents also show Clinton's repeated claims of little training or understanding about the classification process, despite leading the department that handled such information on a regular basis and having a security clearance.\n\nThe document dump also revealed gaps in the record, with numerous sections redacted. The FBI could not obtain 13 Clinton mobile devices that may have been used to send emails from her personal email address, in addition to two iPads. Clinton claimed to have relied on the judgment of her aides and other officials to handle classified material appropriately.\n\nThe FBI documents note that Clinton, when asked about the \"C\" marking before a paragraph in an email marked \"Confidential,\" said she did not know and could only speculate it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order. The email was, in fact, marked \"classified at the Confidential level.\" When asked about different classification types like \"Top Secret,\" Clinton went on to say she \"did not pay attention\" to the classification markings.\n\nClinton's server was found to have more than 2,000 emails with classified material. Most were retroactively classified, but FBI Director James Comey has disputed Clinton's insistence that none of them were marked as such at the time. Clinton has repeatedly said her use of private email was allowed, but in July, she told FBI investigators she \"did not explicitly request permission to use a private server or email address.\" No one at the State Department raised concerns during her tenure, and Clinton said everyone with whom she exchanged emails knew she was using a private email address.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Vigilance in Push for Gun Control Legislation as Senate Bill Faces Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed effort to push for stricter gun control measures, President Obama called on voters to pressure Congress on Thursday, as a gun control package moves towards the Senate floor. The president, surrounded by the mothers of shooting victims, expressed concern that the shock from the Newtown elementary school shooting could soon fade.\n\n\"Less than 100 days ago, that happened,\" Obama said. \"Shame on us if we've forgotten.\" He reiterated, \"I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we've forgotten.\"\n\nAs Washington signals that the Senate bill could be losing momentum and as high-dollar ad campaigns on both sides intensify, the president delivered a message to wavering lawmakers, urging them not to \"get squishy.\"\n\nObama, accusing opponents of drumming up \"fear,\" urged supporters to call members of Congress and pressure them into backing the package. His remarks, however, were met with criticism from Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who suggested the president was exploiting the Newtown tragedy.\n\nSen. Lee stated, \"The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime.\" He added, \"It is deeply unfortunate that he continues to use the tragedy at Newtown as a backdrop for pushing legislation that would have done nothing to prevent that horrible crime.\"\n\nSen. Lee and his conservative colleagues plan to ensure that any firearms proposals require a 60-vote threshold in order to proceed, which could be a high hurdle for the Senate to clear. Already, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dropped from the main package a proposal to renew and expand the expired assault weapons ban.\n\nThe base bill will instead cover universal background checks, strengthened punishments for illegal trafficking, and more money for school security. Items like school security enjoy broad support. However, the move to include private sales\u2014including gun show purchases\u2014in the background check system remains controversial in some circles. The assault weapons ban, which Republicans most adamantly oppose, is still expected to get a vote as an amendment to the main bill.\n\nBoth sides of the gun debate are stepping up their efforts to sway Congress. While the National Rifle Association has been vocal since the start of the process, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just launched a $12 million ad buy in support of the legislation.\n\n\"It's not done until it's done,\" Obama said Thursday. \"There are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject... They're doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Statement on International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement issued over the weekend, President Barack Obama marked the first-annual International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, emphasizing the crucial role of a free press in fostering prosperous, open, and secure societies. The statement, however, has sparked controversy due to the President's history of perceived restrictions on press freedom.\n\nIn his statement, Obama highlighted the importance of a free press, stating, \"History shows that a free press remains a critical foundation for prosperous, open, and secure societies, allowing citizens to access information and hold their governments accountable.\" He further emphasized the principle that \"every person has the right \u2018to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.'\"\n\nThe President's statement, however, has been met with skepticism and criticism from various media outlets, including the New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today. These outlets have characterized Obama as the most anti-free press, \"control freak\" president in history, citing his use of the Espionage Act to prosecute more sources than any other president and the Department of Justice's monitoring of the phones and emails of dozens of reporters from the Associated Press and other outlets.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Obama's statement is further compounded by the United States' current ranking of 46th on the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, behind countries like Botswana, Ghana, and the United Kingdom. This ranking has led some to question the sincerity of the President's statement, with critics arguing that it represents government propaganda rather than a genuine commitment to press freedom.",
    " Title: The Evidentiary Challenge Facing Impeachers: A Look at the Mueller Report and the Ukraine Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impeachment process, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, requires a high standard of evidence to remove a president from office. This was evident in the second volume of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, where he highlighted the challenge of proving corrupt intent in cases of obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller noted that the obstruction-of-justice statute requires both obstructive acts and corrupt intent. While corrupt intent can often be inferred from the alleged conduct, Mueller pointed out that where there is a plausible legitimate governmental motive for an official's conduct, the inference of corrupt intent might not be possible. In such cases, the element of corrupt intent must be established separately, a difficult evidentiary challenge.\n\nThe report left the question of President Donald Trump's intent up to Congress. In the context of impeachment, it is sensible to leave the definition of \"Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors\" to the House and the Senate. However, this approach, as James Madison objected at the Constitutional Convention, could potentially make the president serve at the pleasure of the Senate.\n\nIn the current Congress, removing Trump would require the votes of 20 Republican senators, assuming all Democrats and independents voted in favor. This high hurdle is a reflection of Trump's guarded support among Republican senators. The president's public insults or disagreements with several GOP senators already account for nearly half the GOP votes needed for removal.\n\nDespite this potential vulnerability, the Democrats have failed to carry even this reduced burden. The Mueller report left them with the task of proving that any benefit of the possible instances of obstruction to the president was not merely incidental but was in fact the purpose of the acts.\n\nIn their search for more promising grounds for impeachment, the Democrats have focused on the Ukraine allegations. The question at hand is whether the president conditioned aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky exclusively on a favor that would benefit him personally, or if the personal political benefit was merely incidental to a legitimate government purpose.\n\nThis evidentiary challenge is similar to the one faced in the Mueller report. The Democrats must prove that the president's actions were not in the national interest but were solely for personal gain. This is a high standard, and one that remains to be seen if the Democrats can meet in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: House Speaker Ryan Defends President Trump's Response to Charlottesville, Rejects Calls for Censure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a town-hall meeting aired live on CNN on Monday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan stated that President Trump \"messed up\" in his initial response to the racial demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, but cautioned against politicizing the issue. Ryan, a Republican, said that turning the issue into a partisan battle would be detrimental to the country.\n\nDuring the meeting, Ryan made it clear that he would not support a Congressional move to censure Mr. Trump. He emphasized that the issue at hand is not about Republicans versus Democrats, but about the country as a whole.\n\nRyan repeatedly referred to white supremacists as \"fringe\" and urged them to remain on the fringe. He praised Trump for correcting his response to the Charlottesville events, stating that the president's initial response on Monday was incorrect, his Tuesday response was inadequate, and his Monday night speech on Afghanistan was a step in the right direction.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper pressed Ryan to criticize Trump more harshly for his handling of the situation, pointing out that the president's better responses came from prepared remarks, while his poorer responses were off-the-cuff during an impromptu press conference.\n\nThe questions posed by the meeting's attendees, chosen by CNN, also sought to criticize Trump. One man accused the president of \"bullying\" through his tweets and asked Ryan to explain this to his own children. In response, Ryan offered practical advice: \"I tell my kids to turn off the TV, get off the internet.\"\n\nTapper, a TV host, jokingly expressed uncertainty about Ryan's advice to turn off the TV.\n\nDemocrats have expressed their intention to vote to censure Trump when Congress returns from vacation. However, Ryan's rejection of the censure is likely to keep the effort largely within the Democratic party.\n\nRyan defended the House GOP's agenda under Trump, highlighting the passage of an Obamacare repeal, legislation to overhaul Wall Street reforms enacted after the 2008 collapse, and job training legislation. He noted that hundreds of other bills are awaiting Senate action.\n\nOn healthcare, Ryan stated that the House has done its part, and the Senate must return to work. However, he declined to set deadlines for senators, citing other key votes that need to be addressed soon, including raising the government's borrowing limit.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Foreign Policy Strategy Faces Challenges in Second Term\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama Doctrine, a foreign policy strategy that emphasizes \"soft power\" and reliance on international organizations, is facing setbacks in various parts of the world during the President's second term. This year has seen challenges from Egypt, Syria, Russia, and China, with the most obvious failure being the cancellation of a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the comparison of Putin to a bored child after Russia granted asylum to fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nThe inability of the Obama administration to capture Snowden is just one of many unresolved foreign policy challenges since Mr. Obama's re-election. Some foreign affairs specialists attribute this to a president who is not devoting much time to hot spots overseas. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, stated, \"He\u2019s one of only 17 presidents elected to a second term, and he\u2019s clearly trying to figure out where he wants to put the majority of his time. He\u2019s much more focused on the middle class than he is on the Middle East.\"\n\nIn April, the White House revealed reports of chemical weapons use in Syria's civil war, which Mr. Obama deemed a \"game-changer.\" Four months later, the civil war continues, with fresh reports this week that an al Qaeda affiliate is infiltrating Syrian territory that was seized by rebel groups.\n\nIn Egypt, the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi in early July, who was elected after Mr. Obama encouraged democratic reforms in that country. The White House found itself in an awkward public position, denying that the military's action met the legal definition of a \"coup.\"\n\nEuropean allies such as Germany and France have criticized Mr. Obama over surveillance programs revealed by Snowden. At a Group of Eight summit in June in Northern Ireland, the news was Mr. Putin\u2019s refusal to sign a communique calling for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad, another setback for Mr. Obama.\n\nA summit between Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in June was overshadowed by the breaking news of Snowden's revelations and by the Chinese leader's ability to turn the tables on Mr. Obama and claim that China was a \"victim\" of U.S. cyberattacks.\n\nAs the summer progresses, Mr. Obama has had to retract earlier statements that the U.S. has \"decimated\" al Qaeda. The administration closed 20 diplomatic facilities overseas due to threatened attacks by al Qaeda and its affiliates.\n\nJames Jay Carafano, an analyst on national security and foreign affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, attributes Mr. Obama's second-term problems internationally to the terrorist attack in September that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\"Benghazi, I think, is a signature moment for the president,\" Mr. Carafano said. \"If there were three [foreign policy successes] he could point to, they were winning the war with al Qaeda, resetting with the Russians, and not being George Bush doing everything with a heavy hand. Benghazi really kind of destroyed that mythology. Benghazi has made him incredibly risk-averse.\"\n\nRussia's decision to grant temporary asylum to Snowden was especially embarrassing for the White House because Mr. Obama had made personal appeals to Mr. Putin to send the fugitive back to the U.S. Relations between the two leaders have never been strong; Mr. Putin made a point of skipping a summit hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David last summer.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to assess where the relationship [with Russia] can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world,\" Mr. Obama said at a news conference Friday. \"Where it can, we\u2019re going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, we\u2019re going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples.\"\n\nOne of the few foreign policy bright spots for Mr. Obama was the agreement this month of Palestinians and Israelis for renewed peace talks. Mr. Obama encouraged both sides to resume talks during a trip to the Middle East in March.\n\nLawrence Korb, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the development is \"not going to solve all the problems\" in the Middle East and suggested that the progress is more style than substance.\n\n\"It shows [administration officials] are willing to spend some political capital,\" Mr. Korb said. \"Even if it doesn\u2019t work, it undermines the narrative that we don\u2019t care.\"\n\nMr. Miller said the president can point to three major foreign policy accomplishments in his first term: extricating U.S. troops from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, reducing U.S. dependence on \"Arab hydrocarbons,\" and preventing another terrorist attack in the U.S. on the scale of 9/11\u2014notwithstanding the Fort Hood shootings and the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\n\"On balance, you\u2019re dealing with a guy whose foreign policy has had no spectacular successes, other than the killing of bin Laden,\" Mr. Miller said. \"But it\u2019s been pretty disciplined, with no spectacular failures, either. Given the limitations on American power and our own domestic difficulties, that\u2019s actually not so bad.\"",
    " Title: Concerns Rise Over Potential Political Interference in U.S. International Broadcasters Amid Visa Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nReports suggesting that the new chief executive of Voice of America and its sister organizations is refusing to renew visas for hundreds of foreign journalists, potentially exposing them to retaliation for their reporting, have once again raised concerns that political influence may be encroaching on the editorial independence of these broadcasters.\n\nVoice of America, along with other publicly funded international broadcasters, is a trusted and popular news source globally, known for its independence from political pressure. However, recent developments indicate that the Trump administration may be attempting to interfere with this independence. In late April, the White House baselessly attacked VOA as Chinese \"propaganda.\" More recently, Michael Pack, the new chief executive at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which administers the broadcasters, has moved swiftly to dismiss senior leadership and is now reportedly refusing to act on visa applications, effectively terminating these foreign journalists and depriving the USAGM broadcasters of expertise essential for their reporting.\n\nWhile Pack has the authority to manage USAGM, he cannot interfere with the legal \"firewall\" that has been established over many decades to safeguard the editorial independence of U.S. international broadcasters from political influence. If these moves by the White House and Pack presage a frontal attack on the firewall, all Americans should be deeply concerned.\n\nThe firewall has several elements, but it rests on two fundamental pillars. First, under statute, international broadcasters must adhere to the highest standards of journalism, including transparency, comprehensiveness, balance, accuracy, and strict autonomy. Second, political appointees, like Pack and the secretary of state, are barred from interfering in the \"professional independence and integrity\" of the broadcasting services. Any attempt by Pack or others in the administration to dictate news content would likely be illegal.\n\nFurther, journalists and editors at the USAGM broadcasters have First Amendment rights independent of their status as government employees and contractors. The news staff at VOA and the other broadcasters are members of the media, and efforts to interfere with their work could trigger basic First Amendment protections, such as the right to gather news, the right to be free from a \"prior restraint\" (were Pack to try and block a story's publication, for instance), and prohibitions on official retaliation for protected speech.\n\nMoreover, particularly with respect to the foreign journalists now facing what amounts to firing as their visas expire, Pack's moves may violate civil service protections. It is well established, for instance, that career government employees may not be terminated based on national origin. Additionally, the firewall itself may protect journalists and editors to the extent the decision not to renew their visas is an attempt to interfere with the broadcasters' independence.\n\nSetting aside the legal implications, efforts to interfere with the independence of publicly funded international broadcasters are, practically speaking, unwise. During the Cold War, autonomy, credibility, and professionalism were identified as essential factors in the success of U.S. international broadcasting. The ability of broadcasters like VOA, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty to relay both good news and bad (including bad news about the U.S.) drove massive audience engagement and trust. The appeal was so pressing for officials in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc that they spent the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars trying to jam the broadcasters' signals.\n\nThe public broadcasters also provided an essential counterweight to state-controlled media. For instance, when the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986, foreign broadcasters were the first source of hard news on the disaster for millions of people behind the Iron Curtain, and it forced state-controlled media to grudgingly acknowledge the accident.\n\nFinally, and of particular relevance to the foreign journalists who now face a forced return to countries where their reporting may have angered government officials, one other crucial factor for success was the ability of the public broadcasters to tailor their news to the audience. \u00c9migr\u00e9 broadcasters with an intimate knowledge of the language and culture of listeners again bolstered credibility and thus advanced the effectiveness of U.S. public diplomacy. That talent is invaluable and irreplaceable, and for it to be squandered today for political reasons would be tragic.\n\nThe Reporters Committee regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and its attorneys represent journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases that involve First Amendment freedoms, the newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information.

    " Title: Rising Costs of Necessities Outpace Decreasing Prices of Discretionary Items Amidst Ongoing Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact the economy, the costs of essential items such as food, rent, and utilities are on the rise, while the prices of discretionary items like gasoline, clothing, and transportation are decreasing.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 0.1% decrease in the consumer price index for May, primarily due to discounting in energy, car insurance, public transportation, and clothing prices. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also fell 0.1% for the third consecutive month.\n\nHowever, the data raises questions about whether the consumer price index accurately reflects the experiences of many households. With significant reductions in gasoline consumption and other discretionary spending, the impact of falling prices in these areas may not be felt by many consumers.\n\nMost households spend a majority of their income on necessities such as food, shelter, transportation, healthcare, and clothing. According to researchers at the Brookings Institution, low-income households typically spend 82% of their income on these categories, while middle-class families spend 78%, and high-income families spend about two-thirds.\n\nWhile some discretionary spending has decreased, the costs of essential items are increasing. In May, grocery prices rose 1% compared to April, and over the past three months, they have increased by 4.1% - an annual rate of 17.5%. Beef prices have risen by 11% in just three months.\n\nShelter costs, including both rental and ownership expenses, are not increasing as rapidly as they were at the beginning of the year but are still rising, up 2.6% in the past year compared to a 0.9% drop in the prices of all other items. The increase in shelter costs, which take up a significant portion of household incomes, translates into a substantial impact on budgets, particularly for low-income families, who spend an average of 41% of their income on housing.\n\nWhile savings have soared to a record 33% of disposable incomes in April (with May figures not yet available), the rising costs of essential items may be felt more acutely by households that have lost significant income during the pandemic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 52% of households have lost more than 25% of their income, and many are relying on one-time $1,200 checks or the soon-to-expire $600 unemployment bonus.\n\nIn conclusion, while the country as a whole may be experiencing deflation, not everyone is benefiting from falling prices in discretionary items. The rising costs of essential items, such as food and shelter, may be felt more acutely by households that have lost income during the pandemic.",
    " Title: Visualizing Two Centuries of U.S. Immigration: A Comprehensive Map and Historical Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a captivating interactive map, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics reveals the migration patterns of 79 million people who obtained lawful permanent resident status in the United States from 1820 to 2013. The map, available for viewing as a video or a full-screen interactive version, offers a visual representation of the global origins of U.S. immigrants, with the brightness of each country corresponding to its total migration to the U.S. at a given time.\n\nThe map illustrates a clear evolution in the sources of immigration over the past two centuries. During most of the 1800s, immigration came predominantly from Western Europe, with Ireland, Germany, and the United Kingdom being the main contributors. Toward the end of the century, countries further east in Europe, such as Italy, Russia, and Hungary, became the largest sources of migration.\n\nThe early 1900s saw a shift in immigration sources, with most immigrants arriving from the Americas, particularly Canada and Mexico. The last few decades have witnessed a rise in migration from Asia. This trend is also evident when examining the history of New York City's foreign-born population.\n\nThe map also charts the largest immigration \"waves\" over time, revealing the progression of immigration sources. While it may appear that immigration over the last few decades has been higher than ever before, when viewed relative to the size of the U.S. population, the picture looks very different.\n\nWhen immigration is shown as a percentage of the U.S. population, the chart presents a more nuanced view of immigration trends. This perspective highlights that, while there have been significant fluctuations in immigration numbers, the overall percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born has remained relatively stable over time.\n\nThe map's creator, Max Galka, notes that each immigration wave coming from a particular country has a unique story behind it, often involving escaping persecution or major economic troubles. Examples include Jews escaping Russia after the May Laws were enacted, the Cuban Revolution, the Irish Potato Famine, and the collapse of southern Italy after the Italian Unification.\n\nGalka expresses pride in the U.S.'s role as a sanctuary for troubled people across the world, acknowledging that there are dark spots in the country's history but emphasizing the positive impact of immigration on the nation's fabric.\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the causes of each immigration wave, Galka provides a graphic summarizing some of the major events that led to increased immigration from specific countries.\n\nThe data used for the map is \"persons obtaining lawful permanent resident status,\" which does not include illegal immigration or, as pointed out by @ artsyTrish, people brought to the U.S. as slaves (forced immigration). World borders were sourced from Natural Earth.\n\nGalka's map offers a fascinating and informative look at the history of immigration to the United States, providing valuable insights into the country's demographic makeup and the stories behind the people who have chosen to call the U.S. their home.",
    " Title: U.S. Unemployment Rate Drops Below 6 Percent for First Time Since 2008, Adding 248,000 Jobs in September\n\nThe United States unemployment rate has dipped below 6 percent for the first time since July 2008, with nonfarm payrolls adding 248,000 new jobs in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The jobless rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 5.9 percent.\n\nEmployment increased in professional and business services, retail trade, and health care, as reported by the BLS. The data were stronger than expected, with employers also adding about 69,000 more jobs in July and August than the government initially reported.\n\nThe median forecast among economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for 215,000 new jobs in September. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement that the report extends the \"longest streak of private-sector job growth on record.\"\n\nFurman stated, \"The data underscore that six years after the Great Recession \u2014 thanks to the hard work of the American people and in part to the policies the President has pursued \u2014 our economy has bounced back more strongly than most others around the world.\"\n\nMany economists consider 5.5 percent unemployment a \"healthy number,\" and as the unemployment rate moves closer to that figure, it \"could ratchet up pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate,\" according to The Associated Press.\n\nAs NPR's John Ydstie reports, \"Over the past few years, much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been attributed to people leaving the labor force. But, Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics says in 2014 it's largely job growth that's has pushed unemployment down.\"\n\nDean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays PLC in New York, is quoted by Bloomberg as calling the latest data \"strong across the board.\" Maki told Bloomberg, \"The labor market continues to grow fast enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down.\"\n\nHowever, even with the new jobs, nearly 100,000 people stopped looking for work. The number of Americans working or looking for work was at 62.7 percent, the lowest proportion since February 1978, according to The Associated Press.",
    " Title: President Trump Vetoes Bipartisan Resolution to Block Border Emergency Declaration, Senate Vote Likely Final Word\n\nIn a move that was widely anticipated, President Donald Trump on Friday vetoed a bipartisan resolution aimed at blocking his declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. The veto, which came a day after the Senate voted 59-41 in favor of the resolution, is likely to be the final word on the matter, as lawmakers are unlikely to muster the two-thirds majority required to override the veto.\n\nThe veto took place in the Oval Office, with Trump surrounded by law enforcement officials and families of those killed by illegal immigrants. \"I am vetoing this resolution,\" Trump said. \"Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it.\"\n\nThe original passage of the resolution marked a stinging rebuke from members of Trump's own party, with 12 Senate Republicans joining Democrats in voting for the resolution. The measure was a bipartisan rebuke, as Senate Democrats, who have consistently opposed many of Trump's hardline immigration policies, were joined by Republicans who expressed support for Trump's calls to build a wall but cited concern about the expansion of presidential power.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that the veto was a sign that Trump \"had chosen to trample all over the Constitution.\"\n\n\"It is no surprise that the president holds the rule of law and our Constitution in minimal regard,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"There is no emergency; Congress has refused to fund his wall multiple times; Mexico won't pay for it; and a bipartisan majority in both chambers just voted to terminate his fake emergency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that the House will vote to override the veto on March 26.\n\n\"House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nTrump originally declared a national emergency on the border last month after Congress granted only a fraction of the $5.7 billion he requested for a wall on the border. Declaring a national emergency allows Trump to steer an extra $3.6 billion to the wall.\n\nSenate Democrats were joined by Republicans who expressed support for Trump's calls to build a wall but cited concern about the expansion of presidential power. The resolution had previously passed the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nIn a separate development, the Senate also voted to end U.S. support for Saudi forces in Yemen. The vote was not related to the border emergency declaration.",
    " Title: Yemen, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Iran: Middle Eastern Protests Against U.S. Embassies Over Controversial Film\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of escalating protests across the Middle East, demonstrators in Yemen, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Iran have expressed their anger towards the United States over a film they consider blasphemous to Islam. The most recent attack occurred at the U.S. Embassy compound in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, where protesters breached the embassy perimeter, damaged property, and replaced the U.S. flag with an Islamic banner. Yemeni security forces intervened, dispersing the protesters after about 45 minutes and sealing off the surrounding streets.\n\nThe incident in Yemen mirrors similar attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Cairo, Egypt, and Benghazi, Libya, where the U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. In Iraq, Shiite hardliners protested in Baghdad's Shiite stronghold of Sadr City, with threats of anti-U.S. attacks from Iranian-backed Shiite militia leaders. Protests also took place in Iran and Egypt, resulting in clashes and injuries.\n\nThe controversial film, titled \"Innocence of Muslims,\" came to attention in Egypt after its trailer was dubbed into Arabic and posted on YouTube. The video depicts Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer, and a madman, showing him having sex and calling for massacres. The Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has ordered an investigation into the attack and vowed to bring the culprits to justice, stating that the attack was part of a conspiracy to derail Yemen's close relations with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Yemen strongly condemned the attack, stating that no casualties were reported and that the situation is under control. The U.S. government is working with the Yemeni government to maintain order and protect facilities and personnel. The Pentagon is monitoring the situation in Yemen but has not received any request for military assistance following the embassy breach.\n\nIn Iraq, the U.S. Embassy has yet to respond to the ongoing protests. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi criticized the film during a visit to the European Union in Brussels, urging Egyptians to refrain from \"unlawful acts.\" Egyptian President Morsi also called on President Obama to put an end to such behavior. The situation remains tense, with protests continuing in several Middle Eastern countries.",
    " Title: Ted Cruz's Ivy League Background Adds Fuel to Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nTed Cruz, the freshman senator from Texas, has become a divisive figure in American politics, with his conservative views and intellectual pedigree sparking controversy and disdain from the liberal side. In a piece by Henry Adams, politics is likened to the \"systematic organization of hatreds,\" and for the left, Cruz has been a focal point of this sentiment over the past year.\n\nCruz, a Princeton and Harvard graduate, is not the typical Republican reviled by the other side, as he is a product of the intellectual elite, yet not of it. He excelled at both institutions, with a champion debater title at Princeton and a magna cum laude graduate status at Harvard. His academic achievements, however, have not endeared him to his liberal critics, who view him as a \"constitutionalist conservative who rises to national prominence\" that the prestigious universities should be ashamed of producing.\n\nOne of the left's deepest prejudices is that its opponents are unintelligent, and Cruz challenges this stereotype. Chris Hayes of MSNBC has even expressed fear of Cruz's brilliance, while witnesses at congressional hearings have found themselves on the defensive against Cruz's probing questions. Cruz's unapologetic stance on his political positions and his lack of defensiveness have added to the frustration of his opponents, who are accustomed to assuming a position of intellectual and moral superiority.\n\nCruz's entry into the Senate was not a subtle one, as he made his presence known with the forcefulness of a SWAT team. This has been met with criticism from his colleagues, who believe that freshmen should initially be seen and not heard. At a hearing on guns, Cruz's insistence on the Constitution as the highest commitment of senators was met with mutterings of disapproval from another senator.\n\nCruz's push to defund Obamacare has been criticized for its lack of a realistic path to legislative success. His strategy, which seems to rely on wishful thinking rather than practical politics, has been compared to believing that Republican politicians could simply wish away the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Cruz, it is clear that he will be a significant force in the Senate, potentially shaping the political landscape for decades to come. Whether he ascends to the presidency or not, Cruz's tenure in the Senate could see him making liberals recoil at what Princeton and Harvard have produced.",
    " Title: Mortgage Rates in the U.S. Reach All-Time Low Amid COVID-19 Concerns, Boosting Refinancing Opportunities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, mortgage rates in the United States have plummeted to record lows, driven by concerns surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 3.29% during the week ending March 5, marking a substantial decrease of 16 basis points from the previous week. This historic low surpasses the previous record set in November 2012, when the average rate stood at 3.31%.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also experienced a 16 basis point decrease, settling at 2.79%, while the 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage saw a minimal two basis point drop to an average of 3.18%.\n\nThe decline in rates presents a significant advantage for millions of homeowners across the country, who stand to save thousands of dollars in interest by refinancing. Moreover, an estimated 44.7 million homeowners hold $6.2 trillion in home equity that they could potentially access through a cash-out refinance, according to real-estate data firm Black Knight.\n\n\"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to an all-time low of 3.29% during the week ending March 5,\" said Zillow economist Matthew Speakman. \"COVID-19 is here, and it will continue to be the main driver of mortgage rate movements in the coming weeks.\"\n\nMortgage rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2020, primarily in response to concerns related to the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that began in China and has since spread worldwide. Generally, mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 1% for the first time ever this week following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a benchmark interest rate cut in response to the potential economic impact the illness outbreak will have.\n\nWhile interest rates on home loans have followed Treasurys downward in recent weeks, the spread between the two has widened to an extent. Lenders have been hesitant to trim rates at such a fast pace for various reasons, economists said. For instance, they need to maintain their margins and don't want to cut into their profits too much by reducing rates.\n\n\"They don't know how persistent these rates will be,\" said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree, on why lenders have held off from cutting interest rates more.\n\nThe decline in rates has sparked another refinancing boom, according to Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac. \"Mortgage applications increased 10% last week from one year ago and show no signs of slowing down,\" Khater said in the report.\n\nThose considering refinancing should not delay, as it's not guaranteed that mortgage rates will drop much further than their current levels. Many lenders have reached their capacity in terms of the number of loans they can process. While lenders have increased hiring in response to this increased demand, they are concerned about being caught unprepared with excess staff when rates eventually rise.\n\n\"They don't know how persistent these rates will be,\" said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree.\n\nAn emerging risk for those looking to refinance is the possibility of government orders to shelter in place amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Are they actually going to be able to get people to their loan processing centers?\" Kapfidze said. \"Some of the work can be done remotely, but that might actually create friction in the system.\"\n\nHome buyers may struggle to capitalize on low rates\n\nAs low rates have been beneficial for those looking to refinance, they have also facilitated the home-buying process for would-be buyers. Mortgage application data has shown a growing number of Americans applying for loans to finance the purchase of a new home, a positive sign for the spring home-buying season.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. In recent months, the inventory of homes for sale has reached an all-time low due to high demand from buyers. This low inventory is primarily the result of depressed home construction activity in the wake of the recession, which did not keep pace with household formation across the country. Many single-family homes were also purchased by investors during the bust years and converted into rentals, further constricting supply.\n\nWhile home-building activity has increased since last summer, it is not occurring at a pace that could meet the demand in the market.\n\nAdditionally, the drop in rates could encourage some people to sell their homes. Researchers have debated whether or not many Americans were \"rate-locked,\" meaning that the interest rate on their home loan was so low that it acted as a deterrent from selling their home and buying a new one.\n\n\"If we see significant weakening in the broader economy, including weakening of the job market, it is hard to envision a scenario where the housing market can remain above that fray,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.\n\n\"These sorts of decisions tend to be shaped by factors more reflective of major events in individuals' lives, such as decisions to retire, have children, downsize, etc.,\" said Hamrick. \"It is a lot different than opting to pick up a pack of chewing gum at the last minute at the checkout counter of the grocery store.\"\n\nAnother factor that could prevent Americans from taking advantage of low rates is the overall health of the economy. If the economy takes a dive due to the coronavirus outbreak, many buyers might hesitate, despite the potential savings they would be leaving on the table, Hamrick said.\n\n\"There's no avoiding the fact that a home purchase is the most significant purchase individuals will make in their lifetimes,\" he said. \"That process can be fraught with nervousness under the best of times. If we see significant weakening in the broader economy, including weakening of the job market, it is hard to envision a scenario where the housing market can remain above that fray.\"",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate: Pence and Kaine Deliver Policy Differences, Maintain Composure Amidst Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 vice presidential debate, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, the running mates of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton respectively, provided a valuable service by advancing the political narrative, attacking each other's bosses, and delving into policy differences. The debate, held on a significant night for both candidates, served as a platform for Pence to move beyond the turbulent week of the Trump campaign.\n\nFor Governor Pence, the debate was an opportunity to address the controversies surrounding Trump's tax returns, admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, demeaning comments about women, and the birtherism issue. Pence, in many cases, declined to defend Trump, a strategy that may have been the smart move, as it allowed him to focus on policy differences rather than playing defense.\n\nSenator Kaine, on the other hand, launched a barrage of attacks against Trump, but his aggressive approach and frequent interruptions were met with criticism, with many viewers perceiving Pence as the winner in terms of temperament. Independent pollster John Zogby commented, \"Kaine wins on substance, loses on style.\"\n\nKaine's one-liners, such as referring to Trump as the \"you're fired\" candidate and Clinton as the \"you're hired\" candidate, may have been effective sound bites for future Clinton campaign ads. However, his aggressive approach was markedly different from the more respectful tone taken by Pence.\n\nThe debate took a more personal turn when the topic of faith was broached. Both candidates, Pence and Kaine, are deeply religious, with Pence being an Evangelical Christian and Kaine a Roman Catholic. When asked to discuss a time when faith conflicted with governing, Kaine spoke of his struggle with the death penalty, while Pence focused on the sanctity of life and the abortion issue.\n\nIn a campaign that has been largely devoid of discussions on issues important to religious conservatives, Pence's focus on these topics may have helped the Republican ticket. The debate served as a do-over for Pence, allowing him to score points against Clinton that Trump failed to do in their previous debate, and to demonstrate his ability to maintain his composure during a debate.\n\nFor Kaine, the debate was an opportunity to unload a torrent of criticisms against a Trump candidacy riddled with vulnerabilities. However, his aggressive approach may have overshadowed his policy points, particularly in the eyes of viewers who prioritize temperament and presidential demeanor. The next debate between Clinton and Trump is scheduled for October 9.",
    " Title: Connecticut School Shooting: President Obama Vows Action Against Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, President Barack Obama has vowed to press for meaningful action to prevent similar incidents. The shooting, which left at least 28 people dead, including 20 children, has sparked calls for tighter gun control measures.\n\nThe President, speaking from the White House, called the shooting a \"heinous crime\" and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. He emphasized that the nation has endured too many such tragedies in recent years.\n\nTwo federal law-enforcement officials familiar with the investigation have revealed that authorities recovered a Glock, a Sig Sauer, and a.223 Bushmaster rifle near the body of the suspected shooter, Adam Lanza, who was among the victims. The guns were registered to Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, who was also killed in the shooting.\n\nThe.223 Bushmaster rifle, one of the most popular rifles in America, is under scrutiny after police say the weapon was used in the massacre. The AR-15, another popular rifle, is also being examined.\n\nConnecticut has some of the toughest gun-ownership restrictions in the country. Residents who wish to buy and carry a handgun have to receive a permit, which requires an extensive background check. Assault weapons are banned in the state.\n\nHowever, gun-rights supporters argue that the Connecticut shootings show the limited reach of restrictive gun-control regimes. They argue that such measures create a situation where criminals have guns, while law-abiding citizens are defenseless.\n\nThe shootings come a day after Michigan lawmakers voted to allow trained gun owners to carry concealed weapons into places once prohibited. The bill, which is now on the desk of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, allows schools to opt out if they wish.\n\nThe most prominent federal gun law to go into effect during the Obama administration was one that eased restrictions, allowing gun owners to carry loaded weapons into National Parks and wildlife refuges as long as the relevant state's laws permitted it.\n\nThe President spoke of the children who were killed, saying, \"The majority of those who died today were children\u2014beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them\u2014birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, co-chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that promotes tougher federal, state, and local gun regulation, said President Obama needed to do more than send condolences. \"Calling for'meaningful action' is not enough,\" he said in a statement. \"We need immediate action. We have heard all the rhetoric before.\"",
    " Title: 7th Circuit Court Rules Against Trump Administration in Chicago Sanctuary City Funding Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that the Trump administration's attempt to withhold federal grant funds from so-called sanctuary cities was an overreach of its authority. The court ruled that President Donald Trump's threat to withhold public safety grants from jurisdictions that do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violates the Constitution's separation-of-powers provisions.\n\nThe decision, penned by Judge Ilana Rovner, found that the executive branch's authority on immigration policy does not include withholding funds from cities that were allocated from the legislative branch. The ruling was the latest in the ongoing court battle between the Trump administration and the city of Chicago, which sued the administration in 2017 when it first tried to make federal grant funds contingent on adhering to immigration policy.\n\nChicago, a city that has long refused to cooperate with federal immigration agents, stands to benefit from the court's decision. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who succeeded Rahm Emanuel, celebrated the ruling, stating, \"This is a great victory, not only for Chicago, but for our immigrant and refugee communities everywhere in the country.\"\n\nThe grant money at stake was a mere fraction of 1% of Chicago's budget, but the drawn-out court fight indicated that the lawsuit was much more for Chicago leaders than receiving federal funds. The Justice Department has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where the administration has enjoyed more success with challenges to its immigration agenda, but it's not clear yet how the DOJ will proceed.\n\nChicago's status as a sanctuary city is a point of pride for Mayor Lightfoot, and her administration has specifically instructed local law enforcement not to work with ICE agents in many circumstances. The city does not honor ICE detainer requests, and has even allowed illegal aliens charged with heinous crimes to walk free without notifying the agency, leading to some gruesome consequences.\n\nFor example, Chicago authorities refused to honor an ICE detainer request on an illegal alien in June 2019, and instead released him back into the public. That individual went on to allegedly sexually assault a toddler in a public bathroom. In response to public backlash over the alleged assault, Lightfoot put blame back on ICE.\n\n\"They're critical because we have said very clearly we are a welcoming city, a sanctuary city,\" she said in February in response to accusations that her government could have prevented the crime. \"Chicago Police Department will not cooperate with ICE on any immigration-related business.\"",
    " Title: White House Scrambles to Address Ongoing Family Separation Crisis as Legal Challenges Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The White House is grappling with the fallout from President Donald Trump's reversal on the separation of parents and children who cross the southern border as undocumented migrants. The hurried executive order, designed to quell a growing political crisis, has created its own set of problems, particularly as it does nothing for the 2,300 children already separated from their parents who are awaiting prosecution.\n\nThe executive order, which did not contain any procedures for reuniting children in federal care with their parents, has sparked a wave of criticism and a set of legal challenges that could potentially see the separations reapplied. The uncertainty surrounding the reunification process could deepen on Thursday if the House of Representatives fails to pass two Republican immigration bills that could partially alleviate the separations drama.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen responded to the criticism by stating on Thursday that the administration is working to reunite split families. \"We have a plan to do that,\" Nielsen told CNN's Tal Kopan. \"So a combination of DHS, DOJ, HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] reuniting as quickly as we can.\"\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that the order did not contain any procedures for how to reunite children now in the care of the federal government with their parents. The agency later walked back the statement but said any further plans to reunite families were still in development.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the order is \"not executable.\" \"I was really shocked to see they are not going to unite the kids,\" he said. \"I thought the whole point of this was to reunite the kids.\"\n\nTrump's critics have accused him of creating the problem by adopting a \"zero-tolerance\" policy of prosecuting undocumented migrants, which in turn triggered the separations. \"He created a crisis, he said he solved the crisis. He has not,\" said Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer to CNN's Kate Bolduan.\n\nImmigration was a foundational issue of Trump's 2016 campaign, and it remains a key link between the President and his base. While his retreat is embarrassing, it is unlikely to signal any softening of his broader stance on undocumented immigrants.\n\nThursday morning, Trump continued to express his displeasure with current immigration laws and mislead about the state of US immigration courts. \"We should not be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile the President was campaigning Wednesday night, his critics accused him of solving the problem of separations by simply ordering the indefinite detention of entire families. \"When you have the most powerful nation on Earth saying that it is acceptable to detain families indefinitely, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.\n\nCongress could change the dynamic Thursday when the House votes on several bills that include language that would permanently end family separations. However, even if one of the measures passes, its inclusion of elements of Trump's hardline changes to legal immigration policy seems almost certain to kill it in the Senate.\n\nRepublican Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen argued that the President's executive order had only bought time for Congress to change the law after a Capitol Hill briefing on Wednesday night. \"She essentially said, 'Look, the President is trying to give Congress a little wiggle room on this but we do need Congress to act,'\" Mullin said.\n\nWhile the political situation is murky, the legal challenges to the executive order may be even more complex. Under the Trump administration's new policy adopted earlier this year, many people are funneled into the criminal justice system when they cross the border illegally\u2014and US guidelines mandate at that point that children are separated from their parents. The executive order lays down new guidelines, requiring families to be kept together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHowever, that position is almost certain to be challenged in court because of a 1997 consent agreement that stipulates that children can be kept in detention only for 20 days. That decision could even lead to families being separated again. \"It's absolutely a possibility,\" said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University professor of law, laying out two possibilities if the administration could not get the consent agreement modified, a scenario he judged as doubtful. \"You reunite the family; a clock is ticking. If it goes beyond 20 days, you either release the entire family, which is similar to the Obama policy that the President wants to change,\" said Turley. \"Or you once again separate the family and send the child into some type of custodial care.\"",
    " Title: Boris Johnson Takes Office as Britain's Prime Minister Amidst Iran Tanker Crisis and Brexit Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nBoris Johnson, the new Prime Minister of Britain, steps into office at a time of significant international and domestic challenges. The Conservative Party has elected Johnson, a known admirer of America and a defender of President Trump at times, to lead the country.\n\nJohnson's first task will be managing the escalating naval crisis with Iran, following the seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz last Friday in retaliation for the British seizure of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar earlier this month.\n\nDespite the tense situation, Johnson has signaled his reluctance towards military action against Iran. During the recent TV debates, Johnson expressed his opposition to US military action against Iran. This stance was consistent with his position in 2018, when he was foreign minister, where he traveled to Washington to persuade President Trump to remain in the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nJohnson's pledge to leave the European Union by October 31, regardless of circumstances, is a challenge he inherits from his predecessor, Theresa May. The Conservative Party and Parliament, which were divided over Brexit, remain divided, and Johnson may face a 'no-confidence vote' and early elections within weeks.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed his support for Johnson, stating, \"I like him. I like Boris Johnson. I spoke to him yesterday. I think he's going to do a great job. I think we're going to have a great relationship.\"\n\nDuring an interview with the BBC, Johnson was asked if he would be as submissive as a prime minister, to which he responded, \"I've been, towards the United States of America, craven? Do not be ridiculous. If I may say so, when it comes to sticking up for UK interests, whether it's over disputes with Iran, over the Iran nuclear deal, we have been very, very forthright with the United States of America, and I will continue to be forthright.\"\n\nIn 2015, Johnson criticized Trump, labeling him as having \"stupefying ignorance\" and deeming him \"unfit to hold the office of president of the United States.\"\n\nJohnson, a former mayor of London known for his unconventional ways, has adopted a populist style that has served him well. However, as prime minister, he must navigate through an international crisis, with possible war clouds looming, and maintain a delicate balance in his relationship with the United States.",
    " Title: Five Common-Sense Policies to Cut Spending, Boost Revenue, and Jumpstart Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over America's economic future, one thing is clear: the public desires lower deficits and increased economic growth. However, the challenge lies in finding policies that can garner bipartisan support, as Republicans oppose new taxes and Democrats resist cuts to entitlement spending. Even the sequester, which included minimal spending cuts, was met with significant opposition.\n\nTo bridge this partisan divide and stimulate economic growth, here are five practical policies that could be implemented with cross-party cooperation:\n\n1. Reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending: Encouraging competition between U.S. pricing and international pricing for drugs could lead to lower drug prices in the U.S. By reimbursing doctors based on procedures rather than a percentage of drug costs or tests performed, and by allowing Americans to state their end-of-life wishes when renewing their driver's licenses, we can reduce unnecessary and expensive end-of-life procedures for the terminally ill.\n\n2. End the war on drugs: The war on drugs, similar to Prohibition, has proven ineffective. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would generate new revenue, reduce spending on overcrowded jails, and create job opportunities for the unemployed.\n\n3. Attract top talent: Encouraging those with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay in the U.S. by offering Green Cards would help our economy, create jobs, and generate new tax revenue.\n\n4. Promote volunteerism among the unemployed: Research indicates that the longer unemployment benefits are given, the longer the jobless remain unemployed. Requiring the unemployed to volunteer 20 hours a week at a non-profit could decrease unemployment rolls, develop skills, and create job networks.\n\n5. Allow companies to bring back foreign profits: American companies have parked over a trillion dollars overseas due to taxation in the country where the money was made. Allowing companies to return their profits at a lower rate (e.g., 10%) if at least half the money is spent on new U.S. jobs or capital investment could stimulate the economy, create jobs, and increase tax revenue.\n\nBy adopting these common-sense solutions, we can work towards meeting sequestration goals without raising taxes or cutting entitlements, ultimately helping the U.S. balance the budget and return to a path of prosperity.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Invokes \"Nuclear Option\" to Alter Filibuster Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could have far-reaching implications for the future of the Senate and the political landscape, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on Thursday changed the filibuster rules for presidential nominees, a decision that was met with controversy and divided opinions among senators.\n\nThe unprecedented step, which was taken on a straight party-line vote, was a high-stakes gambit that could reshape an institution Reid has served in for 26 years and ultimately define his legacy as one of the longest-serving Democratic leaders in history. The move, which was emblematic of Reid's hard-ball style, has been a characteristic of his leadership in recent years, whether it was his passage of the health care law in 2009, his willingness to go over the fiscal cliff in 2012, or his refusal to bend to GOP demands during the 16-day government shutdown last month.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Reid enlisted his top lieutenants, Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois, to take the caucus' temperature. However, even as late as Monday evening, Reid was still encountering skepticism from his confidants. In a bid to rally his troops, Reid told one of his closest advisers, \"This is the right thing to do. If I don't do this, I might as well just walk away.\"\n\nAs some of his fellow Democratic senators remained on the fence, Reid called in a heavy hitter to close the deal: President Barack Obama. Obama personally called senators on Wednesday to back the move, and Reid ultimately won the vote on a slim margin, 52-48. Just three Democrats broke with Reid: the retiring Carl Levin of Michigan, the moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and the vulnerable Mark Pryor of Arkansas.\n\nWhen the seismic moment finally came, shell-shocked senators in both parties couldn't believe that Reid pulled the trigger\u2014and were grasping to understand the far-reaching ramifications. Asked how history would remember him after this move, Reid told a media outlet, \"I don't write history.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, senators can no longer filibuster nominees to executive branch posts or the courts, with the exception of the Supreme Court. Legislation could still be filibustered, as could many other Senate actions. However, both sides readily acknowledge that future majorities will cite Reid's precedent to continue weakening the filibuster, potentially ending the delaying tactic on all bills and Supreme Court nominees and allowing a simple majority of senators to work their will. In essence, the Senate could become a replica of the majority-rules House.\n\nThe move left Republicans howling in protest and warning that Reid would ultimately come to regret it. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina called Reid \"a puppet of the president.\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he was acting like a \"bully.\" And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Reid had broken his word that he \"never, ever\" would go this route.\n\n\"For Harry Reid, this has always been about power,\" said Sen. Mike Johanns (R-NE). \"He rammed a rule change through. It's historic.\"\n\nFrustrated by gridlock, Democrats said it was about time to take that step\u2014no matter what it means for the future of the institution. However, it may only perpetuate the gridlock and could usher in a sweeping conservative agenda the next time the GOP returns to power. Both sides have reason to complain: The GOP points out that Reid blocked their amendments more than any other majority leader; Democrats say Republicans have used and abused the filibuster.\n\n\"Having guts\u2014that's how,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) when asked how she would characterize Reid's move.",
    " Title: Republicans Push for Consensus on Obamacare Replacement as Supreme Court Case Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case that could potentially dismantle a core component of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Republicans are accelerating their efforts to define a replacement plan. The case, King v. Burwell, could rule on the legality of subsidies that are crucial to the health law's implementation, and a ruling against the White House could have significant consequences for millions of Americans.\n\nIn March, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in King v. Burwell, a case that poses the most serious legal challenge to Obamacare since the justices upheld the individual mandate in 2012. If the plaintiffs prevail, subsidies could be abruptly cut off to millions of people in states relying on the federal health exchange. This financial assistance would be available in just the 13 states running their own exchanges.\n\nThe potential loss of subsidies would be a significant blow to the health law, the insurance industry, and the people whose tax credits would be cut off. \"What the King case does is give us an opportunity and a reason to come to a consensus sooner, so when we get the ruling of the Supreme Court in June, we are then prepared to say, 'Here is what is better for the American people in terms of affordability, quality, and choice,'\" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee.\n\nRepublicans had initially thought they could put off the replacement debate until the 2016 presidential campaign was well underway, with the GOP nominee putting forward a plan for the party. However, the current political climate has prompted Republicans to begin discussions on how to build consensus on a replacement plan.\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) are refining their Obamacare replacement draft, which is considered one of the most comprehensive in the Senate. They have also brought into the discussion two other key committee chairmen, Fred Upton (R-Mich.) of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), incoming chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\nThe Republican moves come as the Affordable Care Act is working fairly well. The three-month enrollment season for 2015 is going smoothly and is expected to surpass the administration's modest second-year goals of having 9 million covered in exchange plans. As of mid-December, more than 6 million had signed up in the federal exchange, a tally that will rise when the state numbers are added in. And there are two more months to go.\n\nHowever, a ruling in King against the White House would hobble President Barack Obama's signature law and spill over into the rest of the U.S. health insurance system. Without subsidies in two-thirds of the states, the uninsured rate would likely rise, reversing its sharp decline. Premiums could soar if only the sickest people stick with their more expensive coverage.\n\nThe GOP could face a political backlash if people lose coverage from a lawsuit it supported, reminiscent of the fury Obama faced over last year's plan cancellations. The uncertainty surrounding the court case also adds complexity to the Republican attempts to undermine the law through repeal votes and the budget process known as reconciliation.\n\nRepublicans may wait until the court's ruling to decide how they want to use reconciliation. No matter what strategy they adopt, they won't be able to get rid of the law legislatively while Obama is in the White House\u2014although they hope that the Supreme Court could create an opening for significant changes.\n\n\"If [the justices] do what I think they should do\u2014if they really read the law and act according to the way the law is written\u2014then we're going to have a real problem in America,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who is up for reelection in 2016 in a state that Obama carried twice. \"The American public's going to be asking us to act at that point in time. So we've got to figure that out.\"\n\nDemocrats are also preparing for another year of defending the five-year-old law. They've consistently struggled to figure out how to message the law, a problem that's likely to be more acute with near-constant attacks on the law in 2015. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) says Democrats are hoping to bring the people who are benefiting from the law into their argument next year. \"We've got to go out and build coalitions all across the country to defend the gains,\" Murphy said. \"We now have millions of people who have something to lose by repeal. We've got to do a better job of organizing those groups to come up to Congress and be actively opposing repeal.\"",
    " Title: Trump Compares Approval Ratings to Obama's at End of First Year in Office\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump compared his approval ratings to those of former President Barack Obama at the end of Obama's first year in office. Trump's tweets came in response to a new Rasmussen poll showing his approval rating at 46 percent, with Obama's at 47 percent for the same time period.\n\nThe president's comments were made during a discussion on the Fox News program \"Fox & Friends,\" where Beverly Hallberg, president of the District Media Group and a fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation, commented on the poll and the media's coverage of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"When you look at this poll, it kind of reinforces what we have known about what Donald Trump would refer to as the 'fake news,' taking a poll like this and still having the narrative that he is not doing well,\" Hallberg said.\n\nTrump ended December with the passage of landmark tax reform legislation, which Hallberg described as \"huge for his presidency.\" She also pointed out that the media coverage of Trump has been negative, citing the suspension of ABC's Brian Ross for an incorrect story about the former national security adviser in Finland and CNN's retractions of some stories.\n\nFox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, guest-hosting on the program, commented that she could \"just imagine what Obama's poll numbers would be if he had endured the abuse\" Trump has endured.\n\nHallberg added that Trump's tweets can sometimes make it harder for himself, and that he has faced multiple Russia investigations and staff turnover throughout 2017. However, she noted that Trump's high approval ratings, despite negative media coverage and ongoing investigations, suggest that some in the media may not be taking the numbers seriously.\n\nHallberg also pointed out that six out of 10 stories about Trump were negative, while Obama's coverage was \"far more favorable.\" She concluded that Trump's relationship with the media has been controversial, but that the passage of tax reform and the desire for results from the American people may have contributed to his high approval ratings at the end of 2017.",
    " Title: President Obama Faces Challenging Agenda as He Resumes Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Americans take a break from work in the lead-up to Labor Day, President Obama has returned to the White House, ready to tackle a complex and demanding set of issues that could significantly impact his presidential legacy. With over three years remaining in his term, the decisions he makes, or doesn't make, on these issues will be crucial.\n\nThe most pressing issue in the short term is reaching a new spending plan in harmony with Congress by September 30, to avoid a government shutdown on October 1, and to raise the debt ceiling. The United States must also address its debt ceiling. While GOP leaders may not wish to cause a shutdown, they would like to see more spending cuts as part of the debt-ceiling deal. The quality President Obama will most need to express is keeping his cool.\n\nIn the long term, the economy remains the most significant issue. President Obama plans a bus tour of the Northeastern United States to present some of his ideas for economic recovery. When he leaves office in January 2017, Americans will ask if they are better off than they were in 2009, when he first took office. If most of them answer \"yes,\" he is likely to have done his job well. The quality he'll most need to get it done is persuasion.\n\nSyria and Egypt present the toughest foreign challenges, each demanding concerted effort to uncover solutions, reduce human suffering, and move toward peace. The qualities he'll need are wisdom and courage.\n\nDomestically, funding and implementing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and passing immigration reform legislation pose significant challenges. The GOP is divided on immigration reform, with some in the House opposing the idea of \"amnesty\" for those already illegally in the US. The qualities Obama will need are determination, flexibility, and open-mindedness, looking for enough consensus to move forward.\n\nEntertaining members of the 1972 Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins football team on August 20 will provide a welcome relief for an embattled president who is also a big sports fan. Marking the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech on August 28 may be the most satisfying event for Obama, as the clear line between King's call for racial equality in 1963 and the nation's first African-American president makes an eloquent statement, regardless of the words the president decides to utter for the occasion.",
    " Title: Debate Analysis: President Obama and Governor Romney's Foreign and Domestic Policy Clash in Third Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe third and final presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney took place last night, with both candidates delivering strong performances, particularly on foreign policy and the economy.\n\nAs anticipated, the discussion veered into domestic policy for a significant portion of the evening, with both men presenting a flurry of talking points. Romney aimed to appear informed, poised, and plausible as a potential president, while Obama often seemed to be the aggressor, critiquing his challenger in almost every response.\n\nRomney tactfully reprimanded Obama, stating that attacking him (especially dishonestly) does not advance any solutions. The candidates found common ground on several issues, such as Syria, Iran sanctions, and more, leading to smaller disagreements over who would have acted sooner or more forcefully.\n\nRomney's strongest answers came on the state of the economy and the debt, as well as on Israel and the so-called \"apology tour.\" He concluded the debate effectively. The president shared a touching anecdote about meeting a 9/11 orphan and repeatedly emphasized his role as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nOn the whole, Obama delivered a strong performance, although he failed to provoke Romney into the heated exchanges he seemed to desire. Romney executed a clear strategy: to pass the \"eye test,\" challenge the president where necessary, and project strength without appearing unduly bellicose.\n\nThe debate did not appear to be a game-changer, with snap polls initially tilting toward the sitting president. However, CBS's instant poll gave a substantial advantage to Obama, 53-23, with 24 percent calling it a tie.\n\nCNN's snap poll indicated a narrow Obama debate win, 48-40. On the Commander-in-Chief hurdle, Romney and the sitting president ran neck-and-neck. As I said, he did what he needed to do.\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate, various pundits and analysts have weighed in, with many praising moderator Bob Schieffer for his performance. However, some have criticized the president's performance, with John Harris from Politico stating that his performance \"diminished\" the presidency.\n\nIn conclusion, the third and final presidential debate provided a clear display of the candidates' foreign and domestic policy positions, with both candidates delivering strong performances. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, and the debates' impact on the electorate's decision-making process will become clearer in the coming days.",
    " Title: Reuters Media Columnist Jack Shafer Questions the Term \"War on the Press\" in Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article published on May 24, Reuters media columnist Jack Shafer has raised questions about the term \"war on the press\" in relation to the Obama administration. Shafer, known for his critical analysis of the media, questioned whether the legal actions taken against the press by the Obama administration truly constitute a war on the press.\n\nShafer's article, titled \"What war on the press?\", began by citing numerous news organizations, from left-leaning outlets like The New York Times, Washington Post, and Slate, to libertarian publications like Reason and conservative-leaning journalists like Jennifer Rubin, all of whom have accused President Barack Obama of declaring war on the press.\n\nHowever, Shafer's defense of the administration was nuanced, focusing on the language used in an affidavit for a search warrant for the emails of a reporter, James Rosen, which described journalism as a \"criminal offense.\" Shafer relied on an explanation from a George Washington University Law School professor who stated that the expression was \"not a prelude to a prosecution.\"\n\nThroughout the article, Shafer admitted that there has been a crackdown on leaks, but he argued that it was primarily among bureaucrats and not journalists. He also noted that his colleagues have compared the administration's tight-lipped approach to an information \"black hole.\"\n\nDespite this, Shafer undercut the arguments against Obama, suggesting that the press also lobbies like any other interest group and that Republicans have also \"cheered on leak-chasers.\" He also defended Fox reporter James Rosen's reporting, but criticized his journalistic tradecraft in a separate column.\n\nShafer's career and actions speak louder than his words, having spent more than a decade as editor of the left-wing alternative weekly, The Washington City Paper, and working at the left-leaning Slate until 2011. His personal website features a prominent link to a \"Hot Topic\" called \"Everything Murdoch,\" which includes 51 columns involving Fox or Murdoch.\n\nShafer's columns appear with the tagline: \"Jack Shafer is a Reuters columnist but his opinions are his own.\" In this case, that statement rings true, as Shafer's defense of Obama remains a solitary voice in the media landscape.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Set to Alter Senate Rules, Triggering \"Nuclear Option\" Against Filibusters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Senate Democrats have initiated the process to change the Senate rules, potentially ending the filibuster for executive branch nominees. This move, set to unfold on Tuesday, will force the Republican party to either accept seven of President Obama's controversial appointments or witness a change in the rules that would eliminate filibusters for executive branch nominees.\n\nThe decision, if implemented, will significantly shift the balance of power between the White House and the Senate, allowing the president more flexibility in appointing his team. However, this move is likely to exacerbate an already contentious atmosphere in the Senate, potentially hindering bipartisan agreements on issues such as spending, debt, and immigration, which remain unresolved.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, initially stated at the beginning of the year that he would not resort to the \"nuclear option.\" However, following the delay of some of President Obama's nominees by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, Mr. Reid changed his stance.\n\n\"A deal is a deal, a contract is a contract, an arrangement is an arrangement, a bargain is a bargain, as long as each party to such an agreement holds up his end of the bargain,\" Mr. Reid said in a morning floor speech.\n\nRepublicans have warned that they could retaliate if they regain the majority by ending other filibusters, allowing them to push through their own priorities without fear of minority obstruction.\n\n\"These are dark days in the history of the Senate,\" Mr. McConnell said. \"I hate that we've come to this point. We've witnessed the majority leader break his word.\"\n\nFor the moment, Mr. Reid is only forcing a confrontation on executive branch and independent agencies, not judicial nominations or legislation. Democrats have historically employed partisan filibusters of judicial nominees, but both parties have a long history of filibustering each other's executive branch appointments.\n\nDemocrats argue that Republicans have taken the tactic of talking legislation to the extreme in order to obstruct government as part of their anti-Washington agenda. Each side cites statistics to back up its case. Democrats point to the number of nominees where Mr. Reid has forced votes to end filibusters. Republicans say all of President Obama's nominees eventually have been approved.\n\nMr. Reid has set up filibuster votes for Tuesday for seven nominees: for Labor Department secretary, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, three members of the National Labor Relations Board, the president of the Export-Import Bank, and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nRepublicans have requested a bipartisan meeting of all senators to discuss the issue and attempt to reach an accord. Mr. Reid agreed, though he scheduled the meeting for Monday evening, a move that Republicans argue doesn't leave much time to change minds.\n\nThe term \"nuclear option\" refers to changing the rules by a majority vote, rather than the two-thirds vote the Senate usually requires, a rule that guarantees the minority certain rights that have defined the chamber throughout its history. If Republicans filibuster the nominees, Mr. Reid is likely to ask for a parliamentarian ruling on whether the filibuster is legal. Based on Senate history, the parliamentarian will rule that it is, and Mr. Reid will move to overturn that ruling, which requires a simple majority and sets official precedent.\n\nRepublicans have been slow-walking or outright blocking many of President Obama's nominees, but they signaled Thursday that they would be willing to relent and allow votes on most of them. Mr. McConnell stated that the only nominees he was reluctant to approve speedily were two NLRB nominees and the consumer bureau nominee, each of whom President Obama has installed to temporary appointments using his recess powers. A federal court ruled that this maneuver violated the Constitution.\n\nIt takes only a majority vote to approve a nominee on a final vote, but the minority is allowed to filibuster to prevent that final vote, and it takes 60 votes to end the filibuster. The increasing use of filibusters, or even their threat, has shifted power from the president, whom the Constitution gives the right to nominate officers of the United States with the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate.\n\nPresident Obama tried to regain some of that power by using his recess appointment powers in an unprecedented way. He appointed members to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Labor Relations Board even though the Senate didn't consider itself in recess. Two federal appeals courts have ruled that President Obama's NLRB appointments violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court said last month that it would hear one of the cases, and the ruling could dramatically circumscribe the president's power.\n\nMr. Reid waited until after he cleared a major immigration bill through his chamber to raise the filibuster issue, knowing it would be so contentious that it could have ruined his chances to win the bipartisan vote on that bill.\n\nRepublicans contemplated using the nuclear option in 2005 to end Democratic filibusters of judicial nominees, but backed off after a bipartisan \"Gang of 14\" senators struck a deal that preserved the filibuster in limited circumstances. That deal held for several years but has since dissipated.\n\n\"My position has been the same since the Republicans tried to jam judges in 2005 and we stood up against it and said, 'You shouldn't be changing the rules by breaking the rules and almost every Democrat spoke against it,'\" said Sen. Carl Levin, a senior Democrat from Michigan.\n\nHowever, with 54 Democrats in the chamber, Mr. McConnell said, he expects Mr. Reid to be able to find the 51 votes he needs to force the rules change.",
    " Title: Kavanaugh Denies Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Fox News Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in an interview aired Monday on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" denied allegations of sexual misconduct leveled by two women, days before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his confirmation. President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court.\n\nThe interview, conducted with his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, saw the nominee refute the accusations made by psychology researcher and Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges that Kavanaugh held her down, put his hand over her mouth, and attempted to remove her clothes while both were in high school. A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh's, claims he exposed himself to her and shoved his penis in her face at a dorm room party in their freshman year at the Ivy League school.\n\nKavanaugh stated that he never had sexual intercourse \"or anything close to it\" until long after he left Georgetown Prep, the elite all-boys Catholic high school he attended in Rockville, Maryland. When asked about his sexual history, Kavanaugh said, \"Many years after. I'll leave it at that.\"\n\nKavanaugh also denied being at the party where Ford alleges the assault took place, stating, \"I was never at any such party.\" He further added that other people who were allegedly present at the party have said they do not remember any such event, and a woman who was present and was Ford's lifelong friend has said she does not know Kavanaugh and never remembers being at a party with him at any time in her life.\n\nKavanaugh expressed his desire to be confirmed to the nation's highest court, stating, \"I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process and we're looking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend my integrity, my lifelong record.\"\n\nPresident Trump continues to stand by his pick, stating at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Kavanaugh \"is an absolutely outstanding person. Hopefully he will be confirmed quickly.\"\n\nAshley Kavanaugh, who was the personal secretary to President George W. Bush when Brett Kavanaugh worked in the White House, defended her husband, stating, \"I've known him for 17 years and I describe him as decent, kind, and good.\"\n\nKavanaugh chose Fox News for his only interview to refute the allegations, with MacCallum, who joined Fox News Channel in 2004, asking him to address specific allegations, whether he had ever blacked out from drinking too much in high school, and whether similar allegations by someone in high school should count against them later in life.\n\nShaunna Thomas, executive director of UltraViolet Action, a progressive group that opposes Kavanaugh's confirmation, criticized the judge for choosing the \"comfort of a partisan network\" to air his denials. \"If Kavanaugh really wanted to get to the truth, he'd go to the FBI, not Fox News,\" she said. \"This was the move of a political hack, not a nominee to the Supreme Court.\"",
    " Title: Florida State University Shooting: Identification of Gunman and Update on Victims\n\nArticle:\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Authorities have identified the gunman who opened fire at Florida State University's (FSU) Strozier Library on Thursday as Myron May, a 2005 FSU graduate who had recently returned to the area. The shooting left three people injured, prompting a massive response from law enforcement and a subsequent lockdown of the campus.\n\nTallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo confirmed that officers responding to 911 calls early Thursday fatally shot May. DeLeo did not specify whether May fired at police, a detail that was initially reported by a department spokesman.\n\nMay, who was armed with a semiautomatic.380 caliber handgun, reportedly had written documents and made videos discussing being targeted by the government. His Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.\n\nDeLeo described May as being in a state of crisis, struggling either psychologically or emotionally.\n\nTwo of the victims were hospitalized, one in critical condition and another in good condition, according to a spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare. A third person was grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.\n\nClasses will resume on Friday, and the library will reopen, according to Campus Police Chief David Perry. Officials canceled classes on Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.\n\nMore than 300 students were in the library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m. Myron May never made it past the library lobby, according to DeLeo.\n\nJason Derfuss, 21, was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, which the bullet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started, but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.\n\nAllison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla., said she ran for her life when she heard someone say, \"Somebody's got a gun.\" Kope ran out the back door, leaving her laptop and other belongings behind.\n\nUniversity President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also praised the police for their quick and decisive action in preventing further tragedy.\n\nDaniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said he initially thought someone was joking when he heard someone say, \"Somebody's got a gun.\" But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.\n\nThree freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.\n\n\"We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,\" Anthony Coons said.\n\n\"You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,\" Martin said. \"This is something you never want to happen.\"\n\nNikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard \"consecutive gunshots\" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.\n\n\"That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,\" the freshman said.\n\nThe video below, posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis, shows an individual over the intercom saying, \"There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,\" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.\n\nStudents were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms. FSU police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: \"Dangerous Situation! Main Campus\u2014Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.\"\n\n\"If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence, (it) is that the victim count was not higher,\" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.\n\nSocial media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.",
    " Title: The Misrepresentation of Pre-existing Conditions and the Affordable Care Act: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that about half of Americans support the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, many Americans want the health care law repealed, and few want to keep it in its current form. The social media narrative surrounding the ACA greatly exaggerates the number of people who would lose insurance without Obamacare.\n\nOne of the latest social media hashtags used to defend Obamacare is #the27percent, which claims that 27% of Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing conditions are at risk of losing coverage if Obamacare is repealed. This figure is based on a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, a closer look at the data reveals that the pre-existing condition crisis used to sell Obamacare to voters never actually existed.\n\nThe Kaiser report estimates that 52 million non-elderly people, or 27% of the population, have uninsurable health conditions. However, the report states that the vast majority of these individuals have coverage through an employer or through public programs like Medicaid. In other words, the majority of the 27% are not at risk of losing coverage after Obamacare is repealed.\n\nBefore Obamacare, denials of coverage were only possible in the individual market. Repealing the law would only affect the tiny share of Americans, 8%, who get coverage in that individual market. Even within this small segment of Americans, few were likely to face coverage denials before Obamacare. A 2010 congressional investigation found that the nation's four largest insurers denied coverage to only one in seven applicants because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nAssuming the same denial rate in a post-Obamacare world, roughly 1% of the non-elderly population is actually at risk of losing coverage. Even if we were to add every single uninsured American to the individual market and assume the same denial rate, the share of non-elderly people declined coverage due to a pre-existing condition would still be less than 3%.\n\nThe GOP's replacement plan will still protect those with pre-existing conditions. The plan will bar insurers from raising people's premiums significantly, provided they maintain continuous coverage. If they can't find affordable insurance on the open market, they'll be able to turn to state-based high-risk pools supported by $25 billion in federal funding over 10 years for subsidized coverage. This network of high-risk pools will guarantee affordable coverage for those with pre-existing conditions without raising premiums for everyone else in the general insurance pool, as Obamacare did.\n\nIn conclusion, the social media campaigners behind #the27percent are perpetuating a false narrative about pre-existing conditions that gave rise to Obamacare in the first place. Instead of opting for #FakeNews, Obamacare's partisans should stick to the facts. Sally C. Pipes, president and Thomas W. Smith Fellow in Health Care Policy at the Pacific Research Institute, is a leading voice in the debate over health care policy. Her latest book is The Way Out of Obamacare (Encounter 2016).

    " Title: Hollywood Faces Challenges as Cinemas Reopen Amidst Pandemic: Escapism vs. Reality\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation gradually eases into a post-pandemic lifestyle, the return of familiar activities such as dining out, shopping, and social gatherings has brought a sense of normalcy. However, one significant aspect of American life remains absent: going to the movies. With theaters set to reopen in July, the film industry is facing several challenges, including a lack of new releases and strict safety guidelines that may hinder the immersive experience moviegoers crave.\n\nTheaters, which were already struggling in an era of home streaming, are now capping capacity at 25% to 50% of usual numbers and implementing safety measures such as mandatory mask-wearing and temperature checks. These precautions, intended to ensure the safety of patrons, may inadvertently detract from the very reason people pay to leave their homes and watch a movie: to escape reality for 90 minutes.\n\nThe pandemic has left Hollywood disoriented, with the industry grappling to find a balance between creativity and relevance. A recent attempt at a COVID-19 themed performance, featuring a rendition of \"Imagine,\" was met with widespread criticism. Now, more than ever, audiences are seeking escapism from the anxiety and gloom of the past few months, not a constant reminder of the ongoing crisis.\n\nSome upcoming releases, such as \"Unhinged,\" featuring Russell Crowe as a road-raging antagonist, or \"Tenet,\" a spy thriller with a World War III plot, may not provide the desired escape. Films like these, while potentially excellent, may instead induce feelings of panic and unease.\n\nHowever, there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Films like \"The Little People,\" an Irish horror flick featuring 2-foot-tall goblins, or rumors of Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman in \"The Flash,\" offer a return to lighter, more fantastical storytelling. These films may provide the escapism audiences are yearning for, offering a much-needed respite from the harsh realities of the pandemic.\n\nS.E. Cupp, host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, expresses faith that Hollywood can deliver the \"perfectly pure escapism\" audiences need during these challenging times. As the world continues to navigate the new normal, the role of cinema as a source of entertainment and escape remains crucial. The industry's ability to adapt and provide a much-needed escape from reality will be key to its survival and the well-being of its audience.",
    " Title: Washington D.C.'s Political Landscape: A City of Change and Consistent Democratic Voting Patterns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Presidential Geography series, this article focuses on the unique political landscape of the District of Columbia, a city that has consistently leaned towards the Democratic Party in presidential elections. With Washington D.C.'s sole member of Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's political dynamics are explored.\n\nThe District of Columbia, often compared to urban cities with large black populations, has a history of voting overwhelmingly Democratic. The city's Democratic leanings can be traced back to the 1960s, a time when black residents became the majority. However, the city's demographic composition has undergone significant changes over the past few decades.\n\nThe 1970s saw a peak in the black population at 71%, a result of many white residents moving to suburbs. Since then, the city's economy has thrived, attracting young, affluent, mostly white professionals. This influx of highly educated new residents has led to white pluralities in downtown neighborhoods like Chinatown and the Penn Quarter. Today, 49% of adults in the District of Columbia hold a college degree.\n\nSimultaneously, many middle-class black families have moved to suburban communities in Maryland and Virginia. This demographic shift, coupled with rising rents and property taxes, has led to a decline in the city's black majority. The 2010 census found the city's black majority barely intact, and demographers have reported that the black share of the population may have fallen below 50% since then.\n\nDespite these demographic changes, the city's voting patterns remain consistent. The city's large student and faculty population at colleges and universities, as well as its public-sector workers, continue to support the Democratic Party.\n\nThe changing racial makeup of Washington has not altered the city's political leanings, but it has sparked concerns about gentrification and the displacement of longtime residents, many of them black. Calls to limit gentrification and preserve black neighborhoods have increased, and local candidates are now judged by their perceived representation of both old and new residents.\n\nThe District of Columbia faces challenges in education and income gaps, but these issues have not swayed the city's voters from their Democratic allegiance. On Independence Day, a holiday symbolizing the struggle for political representation, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton plans to wave a District of Columbia flag in a Fourth of July parade, symbolizing Washingtonians' struggle for full voting rights.\n\nIn the upcoming 2020 presidential election, it is expected that the District of Columbia will continue to vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The District of Columbia will cast its three electoral votes for the Democratic nominee, unless a candidate like Mitt Romney, who lost the district by a significant margin in 2012, manages to reverse this trend.",
    " Title: South Korea Denies Imminent Nuclear Test by North Korea, Anticipates Conventional Missile Launch\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, South Korean officials denied reports that they had detected signs of an imminent nuclear test by North Korea, but acknowledged the likelihood of a conventional missile launch in the coming days. The denial comes after weeks of escalating threats from North Korea, with analysts in South Korea predicting a missile test within the next week.\n\nStrategic provocations, such as a missile or nuclear test, are considered more probable than military provocations, such as a direct attack against South Korea, according to Kim Sung-han, an international relations expert at Korea University in Seoul. Kim, who until last month served as a vice minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that strategic provocations do not necessarily invite immediate retaliation, but military provocations would provoke \"massive retaliation\" from South Korea.\n\nThe United States' top military commander in South Korea, Gen. James Thurman, and South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Jung Seung-jo, have both canceled separate, long-scheduled trips to Washington in the next week.\n\nNorth Korea announced on Monday that it will recall 51,000 North Korean workers and suspend operations at a factory complex it has jointly run with South Korea, moving closer to severing its last economic link with its rival. The statement did not specify what would happen to the 475 South Korean managers still at the Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea.\n\nThe announcement comes amid weeks of North Korean war threats and efforts to punish South Korea and the U.S. for ongoing joint military drills. North Korea is also angry over the U.S.-led push for United Nations sanctions over its February 12 nuclear test.\n\nNorth Korea may launch a missile at some point in the next seven days. Wednesday is the day beyond which Pyongyang warned last week it can not guarantee the safety of diplomatic staff for the limited number of countries that maintain diplomatic representation there.\n\nNext Monday, April 15, is the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, a key date in a state whose main religion is the cult of the Kim family. If the North fires missiles or conducts another nuclear test, \"I think South Korea and international society will rely on the United Nations Security Council,\" Kim said. \"This type of diplomatic response is more probable.\"\n\nSouth Korea is concerned about a provocative attack near the border areas or a possible terrorist attack from the North that is difficult to identify quickly, as with the sinking of the South Korean navy ship Cheonan in 2010.\n\nThe current crisis \"should culminate around 15 April, but will remain noisy until late April,\" predicted Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Koomkin University in Seoul. From the North Korean perspective, a missile test is \"cheap and necessary,\" compared to a nuclear test that will deplete the North's limited plutonium supply, he said.\n\nThe North Korean regime is \"gradually losing domestic support. There is a chance of an outbreak of public discontent,\" he said. \"It's always helpful to remind the people that their country is surrounded by evil and scheming enemies, and only the leader and the army can keep the country secure.\"\n\nThere is a \"high possibility\" of an imminent provocation from North Korea, but a mid-range missile test is \"more likely\" than another nuclear test, said Shin Jong Dae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\n\n\"The Park Geun-hye administration are taking the threat from North Korea seriously, but they don't see signs North Korea is preparing to attack South Korea. I think the South Korean government will preserve a cool stance, even if the North conducts a missile test,\" he said.\n\nWhile some analysts insist domestic concerns guide Kim Jong Un's actions, Shin said foreign policy goals drive Pyongyang's recent threats and tests. \"They want to force South Korea and United States to offer dialogue, and to extract concessions from Washington and Seoul,\" he said.\n\nThe industrial complex that Pyongyang said would be shut down combines cheap North Korean labor and South Korean know-how and technology. It is the last remaining inter-Korean rapprochement project from previous eras of cooperation. North Korea closed the border to northbound South Korean managers and cargo last week, though managers already there were allowed to stay. About a dozen of the more than 120 South Korean companies at Kaesong have already shut down because they can no longer get needed supplies.\n\n\"The zone is now in the grip of a serious crisis,\" Kim said, according to state media. He said it \"has been reduced to a theater of confrontation with fellow countrymen and military provocation, quite contrary to its original nature and mission.\"",
    " Title: A Historical Perspective on Presidential Debates: Lessons from Reagan, Carter, Mondale, and the 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the highly anticipated first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, a historical look at past debates reveals a pattern that may hold significant implications for the upcoming contest. The debates between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Reagan and Walter Mondale in 1984, offer valuable insights into the power of a candidate's performance in shaping public perception, even in the face of factual errors or policy missteps.\n\nIn the 1980 debate, Ronald Reagan, despite being labeled a \"simpleton\" and hard-right war-monger by his opponent, managed to come across as \"calm and reasonable\" to undecided voters. Jimmy Carter, on the other hand, was perceived as \"controlled, humorless,\" and his statistics-heavy approach was undercut by Reagan's amiable demeanor. The debate is perhaps best remembered for Reagan's famous line, \"There you go again.\"\n\nFour years later, in the 1984 debate, Reagan's performance was described as \"relaxed\" and \"humorous,\" while his opponent, Walter Mondale, was seen as fighting against negative stereotypes of himself. Reagan's victory in the second debate was considered a \"tantamount to victory\" due to a strategic spin campaign orchestrated by the Reagan White House.\n\nFast forward to 2000, and the debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore showed both candidates battling not just each other, but negative stereotypes of themselves. Bush, who was often criticized for his lack of knowledge, managed to sound knowledgeable on foreign policy, while Gore fought against the idea that he was obnoxious or a liar.\n\nThe 2016 election, with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as the least popular presidential nominees in modern polling history, presents a unique challenge. Trump must reassure voters who are concerned about his ignorance, divisiveness, and hot-headedness, while Clinton must win over voters who dislike her as a calculating avatar for everything they resent about politics. The test for both candidates is simple: can Americans imagine waking up on the morning after the election and feeling comfortable or safe with Trump or Clinton in the Oval Office?\n\nAs the two candidates prepare for their first debate, the power of television to shape public opinion and peddle exciting fantasies will once again be on display. With over 100 million spectators expected in the United States alone, the choice between Trump and Clinton will be a difficult one for many voters. Time to choose.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588's correspondents in America will live-tweet their analyses of the debate from 9pm New York time (2am London, 9am Hong Kong). Follow our coverage here.",
    " Title: \"The New Yorker's Allegations Against Kavanaugh: A Closer Look at the Ramirez Accusation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, published by The New Yorker, has sparked a new wave of debate in the ongoing confirmation process. The article, which alleges that Kavanaugh exposed himself to a fellow Yale student, Deborah Ramirez, in their freshman year, has been met with skepticism due to the inconsistencies and lack of corroborating evidence.\n\nRamirez, in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, was reluctant to confirm Kavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty. She only decided to speak out after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney. However, her story still contains gaps, as she was drunk and did not directly see Kavanaugh during the alleged incident.\n\nThe only other corroboration comes from an unidentified classmate who tells the magazine that he heard of the incident afterwards, which, in essence, is more hearsay. The New Yorker has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party, a significant omission if the story is to be used as a basis for damaging a reputation. Two male students identified by Ramirez as being present at the party said they had no recollection of any such incident.\n\nThis allegation comes after another blow to the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford's account. Ford has identified four other people who were present at the high-school party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her as a teenager. All have denied it, including Leland Keyser, a long-time friend of Ford's and a Democrat, who stated through her lawyer that she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where Kavanaugh was present.\n\nThe opposition's hope is that these two stories, with perhaps more on the way, will support each other despite their inherent weakness. If Democrats manage to derail Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of these unproven and possibly unprovable charges, they will have achieved the seemingly impossible by stopping a Supreme Court nominee with two unproven and probably unprovable charges, in a victory for what some might call \"garbage-pail politics.\"\n\nBrett Kavanaugh is a highly respected jurist with a sterling reputation built over decades of public service. If his career is to be ruined and his reputation tarnished, it should require clear and convincing evidence. As of now, the facts lead us to believe that this is a questionable episode that makes Borking, a previous Supreme Court nomination process, look above-board and responsible by comparison.\n\nIf Republicans choose to yield to these allegations without clear evidence, they will face the wrath of their own voters, and rightly so. The confirmation process continues, and the public awaits the emergence of concrete evidence to support or refute these allegations.",
    " Title: Silicon Valley Entrepreneur's Crusade Against Climate Change Critics: A Look at the CO2 Coalition and Climate Feedback\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Stacey Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, and Tom Steyer, former presidential candidate, along with the leaders of 17 large environmental lobbies, have called for the banning of the CO2 Coalition, a research group that advocates for the benefits of carbon dioxide and challenges the mainstream narrative on climate change. The CO2 Coalition, with an annual budget of half a million dollars, is facing opposition from environmental lobbies whose combined annual budgets exceed half a billion dollars, and Steyer's personal wealth is estimated at $1.6 billion.\n\nThe CO2 Coalition, made up of 55 climate scientists and energy economists, has been criticized by mainstream media for its stance on carbon dioxide, a gas that is considered non-polluting and a vital source of food for plants and plankton. The group's budget is significantly smaller compared to the environmental lobbies, which have been successful in shaping the narrative on climate change.\n\nThe CO2 Coalition's executive director, Dr. Caleb Rossiter, questions how the Steyer-Abrams group even noticed the CO2 Coalition, let alone perceived it as a threat. The answer, according to Rossiter, lies in the work of Eric Michelman, a Silicon Valley computer entrepreneur who has been actively working to suppress media debate on climate change for over a decade.\n\nMichelman, who made his fortune creating a modification of the computer mouse, founded Climate Feedback in 2016. The group's purpose is to \"fact-check\" and label as \"false\" any deviant thoughts about fossil-fueled climate catastrophe. Climate Feedback has been certified as an unbiased source on climate issues by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which was founded by the Tampa Bay Times and operates the left-leaning PolitiFact.\n\nIn 2019, a \"false\" label was placed on a Washington Examiner post written by Dr. Rossiter and Dr. Patrick Michaels, the senior fellow and a former president of the American Association of State Climatologists. The post described the poor performance of climate models that had projected alarming increases in future temperatures. The \"false\" label triggered a wave of censorship from Facebook's algorithms, blocking reposting and advertising.\n\nThe detailed, scientifically referenced letter written by Dr. Rossiter and others to Facebook, which eventually led to the label being reversed, is similar in form and argument to responses this summer to similar Climate Feedback censorship written by environmental writer Michael Shellenberger, Dr. Michaels, and climate statistician Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. All agree that Climate Feedback is biased, sloppy, and often factually incorrect.\n\nClimate Feedback is Michelman's third major attempt at promoting climate alarmism and silencing opposing views. Previous attempts include the Climate Change Education Project in 2008 and the More than Scientists campaign in 2015. Michelman's group should never have been allowed into a network of \"unbiased\" reviewers, according to Dr. Rossiter, due to Michelman's predetermined consensus on catastrophe before founding Climate Feedback.\n\nDr. Rossiter is open to debating with Climate Feedback, but he believes that the cancel culture does not believe in debate. Instead, it seeks to silence its opponents by denying them a platform. The CO2 Coalition intends to hold on as long as possible, with Dr. Rossiter expressing faith in the truth prevailing, even against \"fact-checkers.\"",
    " Title: The Military Background of George Washington's First Cabinet: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early days of the United States, the first presidential cabinet, led by George Washington, was predominantly composed of individuals with military backgrounds. This composition, if calculated to include Washington himself, saw 80% of the cabinet members having prior military experience.\n\nWashington, a former commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolution, hand-picked every member of his cabinet. For the position of Secretary of the Treasury, he chose Alexander Hamilton, a man of military experience, intelligence, and linguistic prowess. Hamilton, born on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean, was illegitimate and had a challenging upbringing, but he became an ardent supporter of American independence and served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was the sole civilian member of the cabinet. For the position of Attorney General, Washington chose Edmund Randolph, a Virginia patriot with no military training but a distinguished family background. Randolph served as one of Washington's aides-de-camp but was soon called home to settle his uncle's estate and manage the Randolph fortune.\n\nHenry Knox, America's first Secretary of War, was a Boston native of Scots-Irish descent who made his living as a bookbinder. He studied engineering and military tactics in his spare time and, when the Revolution began, enlisted. Knox's contributions to the Revolution include the acquisition of artillery from Fort Ticonderoga, which played a crucial role in driving the British out of Boston, and the planning of Washington's crossing of the Delaware.\n\nEven the first Postmaster General, Samuel Osgood, had a military background, having led a company of local militia at the Battle of Lexington and Concord and rising to the rank of Colonel during the Siege of Boston.\n\nThe current debate over the military background of the generals being considered for national security positions in President-elect Trump's cabinet is misplaced, given the ongoing wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, as well as the global threat posed by the Islamic State. In times of crisis, the choice between an Ivy League academic and a general should favor the general, given their leadership skills, loyalty, and long history of defending the American people and the Constitution. The appointment of military personnel to the cabinet does not pose a threat to American liberties, as demonstrated by the smooth transition of power throughout the 227-year history of the United States.",
    " Title: New Orleans Removes Second Confederate-Era Monument, Jefferson Davis Statue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the city of New Orleans removed the Jefferson Davis Memorial on Thursday morning, marking the second of four Confederate-era monuments slated for removal. The statue, erected in 1911 in honor of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, was taken down at around 6 a.m. by workers wearing masks and helmets, with the area heavily guarded by police officers to prevent potential clashes between pro- and anti-monument groups.\n\nThe decision to remove the statues was made in 2015, as many residents view these monuments as symbols of racism and white supremacy. In a press release on Thursday, the city stated that the statues were built decades after the Civil War to \"celebrate the 'Cult of the Lost Cause,'\" a movement it says promotes white supremacy.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in the statement, \"Three weeks ago, we began a challenging but long overdue process of removing four statues that honor the \u2018 Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\u2019 Today we continue the mission.\" He further added, \"These monuments have stood not as historic or educational markers of our legacy of slavery and segregation, but in celebration of it. I believe we must remember all of our history, but we need not revere it.\"\n\nThe city began the process of taking down the statues late last month, starting with the removal of the monument to the Battle at Liberty Place. Workers in that removal crew also wore masks, and the area was guarded by officers and snipers. Proponents and opponents of the removal plan have taken part in sometimes tense demonstrations at monument sites in the past, leading to multiple arrests and charges of disturbing the peace.\n\nThe city has not released a timeline for its removal plans, citing \"widely known intimidation, threats, and violence, serious safety concerns.\" However, Landrieu previously stated that the monument of Davis and the statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard could come down \"anytime, sooner rather than later.\"\n\nIn a recorded message late Wednesday, the staff at the Morris Jeff Community School, located near the Jefferson Davis monument, informed parents that the statue would be removed overnight. Parents were also asked not to share the news on social media \"for safety and security\" reasons, as it fears that could intensify crowds and \"attract more protesters.\"\n\nThe removal of the Jefferson Davis Memorial and the upcoming removal of the remaining Confederate-era monuments in New Orleans continues a nationwide trend of reevaluating and removing symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces.",
    " Title: Yates Testifies on Flynn Misinformation: Unveiling the Uncertainty Surrounding the Trump Administration's Early Days\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a significant turn of events, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified before a Senate subcommittee on Monday, detailing her efforts to warn the Trump administration about the misinformation provided by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nDays following the inauguration, Yates recounted three conversations with White House counsel Donald McGahn, two in person and one over the phone, where she expressed concerns about the statements made by Vice President Mike Pence and others regarding Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Yates stated that she believed Flynn was compromised due to his interactions with the Russians.\n\n\"We believe that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\" she told lawmakers.\n\nThe crux of her testimony revolved around her conversation with McGahn. \"We told them how we had this information, how we had acquired it, and how we knew it was untrue,\" she said.\n\nPresident Trump dismissed Flynn four days after The Washington Post published a story about Flynn and the reported misinformation he provided. This was more than two weeks after Yates' warning to the White House.\n\n\"Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nIn the hearing, Yates clarified that she did not know how The Washington Post obtained the story. However, she did confirm that Flynn had shared inaccurate information due to phone calls intercepted by the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his defense of Flynn, with conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which has filed a lawsuit about these intercepted phone calls, backing him up.\n\n\"President Trump is onto something,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News. \"The Obama administration was monitoring at least people close to him, and certainly, the results of that classified intelligence gathering were leaked, which is wildly illegal.\"\n\nYates maintained that her decision to inform the White House was not politically motivated and she did not call for the Trump administration to fire Flynn.\n\n\"We gave them this information so that they could take action,\" she said.",
    " Title: DOJ to Urge Federal Court to Reinstate Voting Rights Act Pre-Clearance for Texas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could escalate the ongoing debate over voting rights, the Obama administration announced Thursday that it will urge a federal judge to subject the State of Texas to the pre-clearance procedure of the Voting Rights Act, a key part of which was largely struck down by the Supreme Court last month.\n\nIn a speech to a National Urban League conference in Philadelphia, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department will make this request in a lawsuit filed by Latino state lawmakers challenging Texas' redistricting plan based on the 2010 census.\n\n\"Based on the evidence of intentional racial discrimination, as well as the history of pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities that the Supreme Court itself has recognized, we believe that the state of Texas should be required to go through a preclearance process whenever it changes its voting laws and practices,\" Holder said.\n\nThe new request would require Texas to continue to preclear those changes for the next decade. Governor Rick Perry criticized the move, stating, \"Once again, the Obama Administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott also announced plans to push back against the move, stating on Twitter, \"I'll fight #Obama's effort to control our elections & I'll fight against cheating at the ballot box.\"\n\nIn its ruling last month, the Supreme Court invalidated a legislative formula that had resulted in parts or all of 15 states having to clear all voting changes in advance with the Justice Department or federal court. However, the justices left intact a rarely-used mechanism that allows judges to impose the same pre-clearance requirements on states and localities found to have intentionally discriminated illegally in voting practices.\n\nThis move by the Justice Department is being seen as an attempt to restore some of the status quo that existed before the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder. Some advocates of tough voting rights enforcement by the federal government have argued that the Justice Department could and should use the so-called \"bail-in\" procedure to achieve this.\n\nAttorney General Holder vowed to keep up the pressure on voting rights, but he also warned that piecemeal measures like the one against Texas won't completely replace the process in place until last month. Holder's announcement of the move against Texas was met with loud applause from the largely African-American audience at the Urban League conference.\n\nWhile Holder spoke extensively about the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last week, he made no direct reference to the episode or to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on murder charges stemming from the shooting. Holder did note that a federal hate crimes law passed in 2009 \"improved our ability to hold accountable those who commit bias-motivated acts of violence.\" However, he did not mention calls for it to be used to charge Zimmerman.\n\nHolder said last week that an investigation into the shooting is ongoing. However, President Barack Obama seemed to dampen expectations of a federal prosecution when he stressed last week that criminal matters are traditionally resolved at the state and local level. The Urban League has called for a \"thorough federal investigation\" of possible violations of civil rights and hate crimes laws in the case. Martin's mother is scheduled to address the conference on Friday.",
    " Title: International Community Divided Over Trump's UN Address, Criticism of Iran and North Korea Draws Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated address at the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. President Donald Trump singled out Iran and North Korea for criticism, sparking controversy among some member nations. The U.S. president labeled Iran as a \"corrupt dictatorship\" and North Korea as a \"rogue regime,\" and threatened to \"totally destroy\" the latter if necessary.\n\nIn response, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif described Trump's speech as \"ignorant hate speech\" that does not belong in the UN. North Korea has yet to respond to Trump's threat.\n\nTrump's speech outlined a vision for a world of sovereign states working for the betterment of their citizens, but he spent significant portions criticizing what he called \"rogue nations\" that are \"the scourge of our planet today.\"\n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly warned North Korea over its weapons tests, which violate UN Security Council resolutions. On Tuesday, Trump criticized North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, saying, \"Rocket man is on a suicide mission.\"\n\nReuters news agency reported that one audience member covered his face with his hands, and that loud, startled murmurs filled the hall in response to Trump's remarks. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, who was observed crossing her arms, told the BBC, \"It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience.\"\n\nTrump called on \"the righteous many\" to confront \"the wicked few,\" and in his speech, he called Iran \"a corrupt dictatorship\" whose \"chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.\" He also criticized the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers as \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\"\n\nIranian media have followed the lead of Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in denouncing President Trump's remarks. Commentators on the official TV news channel IRINN compared Trump's speech to the bizarre performance of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at the same podium in 2009. They accused him of \"breaking diplomatic convention\" in an address \"full of contradictions.\"\n\nIRINN broadcast the entire speech live but its translator omitted Trump's critical remarks on Iran, which prompted comment on social media. Iranian MP Mahmudi Sadeqi wrote on Twitter, \"The poor translator suffered so much trying to distort and censure Trump's baseless remarks simultaneously on IRINN!\"\n\nIranian TV also reported Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's description of Trump as a \"new Hitler.\" Pro-reform dailies heaped scorn on what the newspaper Ebtekar called the U.S. president's \"repetitive and baseless claims.\" The paper hoped that Europe would \"rein him in,\" while Qanoon dubbed him a \"villain at the UN.\"\n\nAll eyes will now be on Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who will address the UN General Assembly later today. Trump also targeted Venezuela, calling its government a \"corrupt socialist dictatorship\" and warning that the U.S. was prepared to take action against it. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected what he called \"threats.\"\n\n\"Trump is not the president of the world...he can not even manage his own government,\" he said. Bolivian President Evo Morales, an ally of the Venezuelan government, tweeted, \"I am not surprised that a multi-millionaire like Trump attacks socialism. Our struggle will always be ideological and pragmatic.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, also speaking to the General Assembly, defended the nuclear deal with Iran, saying, \"Renouncing it would be a grave error.\" But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed Trump during his speech, saying the deal with Iran should be amended or scrapped altogether, and warning against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his \"America First\" doctrine but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. In contrast to the focus on globalization that has driven so much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s, Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system. There was a nod to the old axis-of-evil theme. His rogues' gallery took in a predictable cast of North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela. Nonetheless, Trump's worldview contained many contradictions. Where exactly is the boundary between national sovereignty and collective action? And does America's newfound foreign policy pragmatism extend just to calling for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela or actually for doing something practical about it?",
    " Title: Political Tensions Escalate as Romney and Obama Campaigns Clash Over Taxes and Offshore Investments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange of political rhetoric, both the Obama and Romney campaigns have found themselves in a contentious standoff over the Republican's wealth and tax policies.\n\nAmanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, has labeled questions about the Republican's wealth as an \"unfounded character assault\" and deemed it as \"unseemly and disgusting.\" The aggressive push by the Democrats comes in the wake of another mediocre jobs report, which has provided fresh ammunition for Mr. Romney's criticism of President Obama's economic policies. The report revealed that only 80,000 jobs were added in June, marking the worst quarter for job creation since the summer of 2010.\n\nPresident Obama, in response, sought to shift the focus with his call for an extension of middle-class tax cuts. He stated that the fate of similar cuts for the wealthy would be determined by voters in November's election. \"My opponent will fight to keep them in place,\" he said. \"I will fight to end them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the President's advisers and allies have intensified their scrutiny of Mr. Romney's financial holdings, seizing on reports by the media that some of the Republican's personal money is kept in overseas bank and investment accounts. A recent article in Vanity Fair magazine added new details about the status of Mr. Romney's finances, including his financial interests of at least $30 million in 12 funds in the Cayman Islands.\n\nKevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney's campaign, has maintained that the Republican candidate \"hasn't paid a penny less in taxes by virtue of where these funds are domiciled.\" However, this response has not deterred Democrats and the Obama campaign from attacking.\n\nRobert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, has accused the Republican candidate of not providing voters with the necessary information to make an informed decision about his wealth. \"Release the tax returns,\" Mr. Gibbs said. \"If Mitt Romney is not hiding something in Bermuda and Switzerland and the Caymans, it will be in the tax returns.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign is walking a fine line, attempting to portray Mr. Romney as out of touch while not appearing to question the value of wealth. This approach could backfire, particularly with moderate voters in battleground states.\n\nSo far, Mr. Obama's campaign has focused more directly on Mr. Romney's role as a business executive, suggesting that his career was a boon to the wealthy and that he did not have the interests of workers at heart. Now, Democrats are hoping to contrast Mr. Obama's refusal to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and Mr. Romney's desire to cut taxes for people like him.\n\nMr. Romney's advisers believe that this effort will misfire. They argue that voters want the candidates to discuss how they will turn around the economy. Polling suggests they may be right, as a Washington Post/ABC News poll in April found that 71 percent of those surveyed did not consider Mr. Romney's wealth to be a major reason to support or oppose him.\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Romney's advisers intend to ignore the attacks on his personal wealth. On Monday, they focused on Mr. Obama's renewed call to let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire. \"Americans are struggling in a 'zombie economy,' and President Obama's only answer is to pass one of the largest tax hikes in history,\" Ms. Henneberg said.",
    " Title: Challenging the Allegorical Narrative: A Closer Look at Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the testimony of Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27, 2018, has sparked a heated debate. The narrative that has emerged, labeling Kavanaugh as a symbol of White Male Entitlement, has been widely criticized for its allegorical nature and lack of consideration for Kavanaugh as a real person.\n\nThe characterization of Kavanaugh as a metaphor for White Male Entitlement, as seen in the works of philosophers like Martha Nussbaum and columnists such as Jonathan Capehart and Maureen Dowd, reduces him to an abstract idea rather than a human being with agency. This reductionist approach overlooks the complexities of Kavanaugh's experiences, qualifications, and the circumstances surrounding his nomination.\n\nKavanaugh's critics have based their arguments on a narrative of bigotry, where men from his background are assumed to be symbols of collective guilt due to past misdeeds. This narrative, however, disregards the possibility that Kavanaugh may feel entitled to the job due to his qualifications and years of service on the second-highest court in the country.\n\nMoreover, the allegations against Kavanaugh, such as orchestrating gang rapes, have not been substantiated, and it is questionable to attribute his anger to an abstract idea of white-male powerlessness rather than the serious allegations against him. The narrative also overlooks the fact that Kavanaugh's critics have made accusations that have led to unspeakable evils in the past, such as the treatment of black men during the times depicted in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nIt is essential to remember that Brett Kavanaugh is a real person, not a character in an allegory. Appeals to historical grievances, highbrow theories of the male psyche, and pent-up resentments may be interesting or emotionally powerful, but they are not all that relevant in this real-world context. The ongoing debate surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation should focus on the facts, qualifications, and the potential impact of his appointment to the Supreme Court, rather than reducing him to a symbol of a broader narrative.",
    " Title: President Trump Reverses Decision to Eliminate Funding for Special Olympics\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced that he is reversing a budget request to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics, a move that comes a day after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was criticized for defending a proposed $17.6 million cut to the organization.\n\nThe request was included in Mr. Trump's $4.75 trillion federal budget, which was not expected to pass Congress. Mrs. DeVos had earlier told Congress that the US Department of Education had to make \"tough choices\" following a 10% cut to her agency's budget, adding that the nonprofit group should be funded through private donations.\n\nThe cuts came as part of the administration's proposed budget for the 2020 fiscal year, which totals $4.75 trillion, the largest in federal history. The budget request slashed $17.6 million in funding for the Special Olympics, about 10% of the nonprofit organization's overall revenue.\n\nThe spending plan also included more than $1 trillion in cuts to the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled, while allotting $8.6 billion for the US-Mexico border wall. However, the budget proposal is not expected to pass Congress, which must approve it.\n\nAndrea Cahn, the Senior Director of Unified Champion Schools for Special Olympics who runs the Unified Champion programmes in the United States, says the budget cuts would have affected programmes in 6,500 schools. The funding received from the US Department of Education is specifically for the Unified Champion schools programming.\n\nRaymond S Kellis High School in Arizona is one of the schools that has adopted this type of programme. Michael Wakeford, a special education teacher and Unified Sports coach at the school, says the programme has enabled children with intellectual disabilities to be more outgoing.\n\n\"It helps our society bring faith back to humanity in a divisive world in a place where it's easy to fear what we do not know and to fear what we do not understand,\" Mr. Wakeford adds.\n\nThe Special Olympics, founded in 1968 in Washington DC, provides year-round training, health education, community building, and athletic competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. It currently serves over five million athletes across 190 countries.\n\nThe sports organization is separate from the Paralympics, which are mostly for elite athletes who have physical disabilities. Both groups are recognized by the International Olympics Committee. The US Special Olympics chapter provides trainings and competitions in 18 sports, including soccer, swimming, equestrian, and basketball. The Special Olympics World Games, which took place in Abu Dhabi earlier this month, are held every two years.",
    " Title: Georgia Governor Overrides Local Mask Mandates, Extends COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has issued an order that overrules local government mandates requiring people to wear masks in public, asserting that the state's less-stringent guidelines take precedence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kemp extended the state's COVID-19 restrictions, which strongly encourage the wearing of masks but do not require them in public, labeling a statewide mask mandate as \"a bridge too far.\" His order rescinds mask orders in key cities such as Atlanta, Savannah, Athens, and Augusta, along with more than a dozen other local jurisdictions where similar directives have been issued.\n\nThe Republican governor has been at odds with mayors and city administrators over the issue in recent days. For instance, Atlanta's Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a return to tough measures to control an ongoing spike in coronavirus infections in the capital, but Kemp's office insisted that her order was \"non-binding and legally unenforceable.\"\n\nGeorgia reported its second-highest new coronavirus case count to date on Wednesday, with 3,871 new confirmed cases and 37 COVID-19 deaths. Since the start of the pandemic, nearly 128,000 people in Georgia have tested positive for the coronavirus, and over 3,000 have died. Half of all new cases are being reported in Atlanta, the capital and largest city.\n\nThe Fulton County Health Department released their latest COVID-19 epidemiology report on July 13. The full report (which includes data for hospitalizations, long-term care facilities, demographics, and maps) can be found on the Fulton County Information website at https://t.co/pqVzMBaLq3.\n\nEarlier this month, some 1,400 health care workers signed a letter to Kemp warning that Georgia \"is simply not prepared\" for an upsurge in COVID-19 cases. The letter stated that the rising number of confirmed infections in the state \"cannot be accounted for by increased testing.\"\n\nKemp's new order requires people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, to shelter in place. It also requires restaurants and other businesses to follow social distancing precautions and restricts public gatherings to no more than 50 people.\n\nHowever, in their letter, the health care workers called for stricter measures, including a statewide mask requirement, reinstating the closing of bars and nightclubs, and prohibiting indoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including in churches, synagogues, and mosques.\n\n\"To close down when they need to close down, to mandate masks even if the governor's not willing to mandate masks. It could make a huge difference,\" said Dr. Melanie Thompson, who helped write the letter, according to 11Alive News.\n\nThe governor's new order, which expires at the end of the month, was issued on the same day that President Trump visited a UPS hub in Atlanta. The president thanked \"every driver, worker, and employee\" who has worked through the pandemic.\n\nTrump has sought to deflect criticism of his administration's handling of the crisis, at times using racist, anti-Asian language to describe the coronavirus. In his speech at the UPS facility, the president praised the carrier's workers and referred to \"our battle against the China virus.\"",
    " Title: Geithner's 2008 Warning on LIBOR Rate-Setting Process Surfaces\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a two-page memo from 2008, penned by then-New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner, has come to light, expressing concerns about the integrity and transparency of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate-setting process. The memo, addressed to Mervyn King, the then-head of the Bank of England, suggests that steps should be taken to improve the process.\n\nThe memo, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Thursday, outlines six key recommendations aimed at preventing LIBOR manipulation. These recommendations focus on practices that aim to prevent accidental or deliberate misreporting and eliminate incentives for banks to report inaccurate rates. In the email accompanying the memo, Geithner expresses a desire to discuss these recommendations further and seeks feedback on potential changes.\n\nThe LIBOR manipulation scandal erupted last month when London's Barclays bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for its practices, leading to the resignation of its CEO, Bob Diamond. The 2008 note to King is likely to spark further questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill regarding Geithner's knowledge of banks' efforts to manipulate LIBOR and the extent to which he attempted to address the issue.\n\nThe LIBOR benchmark interest rate, published every business day in London, gauges the cost of borrowing between banks. The number of banks contributing to the process varies per currency (18 for the U.S. dollar). The rate, published midday, affects the cost of lending for a range of products, such as mortgages and credit cards.\n\nA group of 12 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Thursday, demanding a full investigation. \"This scandal calls into further question the integrity of many Wall Street banks and whether our prosecutors and regulators are up to the task of regulating them,\" the senators wrote.\n\nThe emergence of this 2008 memo adds a new layer to the ongoing LIBOR manipulation scandal, potentially shedding light on the early warnings and efforts to address the issue. The full implications of this development remain to be seen as the investigation unfolds.",
    " Title: Disparity in Perceptions of Obamacare's Impact: A Political Divide Reflected in Kaiser Family Foundation Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll has revealed a significant disparity in the perceptions of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) between Democrats and Republicans. The poll suggests that Democrats are more likely to report personal benefits from Obamacare and know individuals who have gained coverage through the law, while Republicans are less likely to acknowledge such experiences.\n\nAccording to the poll, only 5% of Republicans reported being helped by Obamacare, compared to 26% of Democrats. Similarly, when asked about knowing someone who had gained coverage through the law, 49% of Democrats responded affirmatively, while only 19% of Republicans did.\n\nHowever, the disparities in self-reported benefits and knowledge of beneficiaries may not necessarily reflect the actual reach of the health care law. Instead, they could be a reflection of the deeply held political views about the Affordable Care Act. Democrats might be overestimating the law's impact, while Republicans might be underestimating it, with the truth likely lying somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe poll also showed that Republicans were more likely to report knowing someone who had lost health coverage or had their hours reduced due to Obamacare. This could suggest that the political divide in perceptions of the health care law extends beyond personal experiences to encompass broader societal impacts.\n\nThe reasons for the disparities in perceptions could be multifaceted. For instance, Democratic governors have been more likely to expand the Medicaid program, which is not available in some Republican-run states. This could potentially explain why Democrats know more people who have benefited from Obamacare.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that this factor alone would account for the significant disparities in perceptions of how the health care law is faring.

The investigation, which involved undercover recordings at Facebook, Accenture, and Cognizant, the contractors responsible for Facebook's content moderation, has revealed comments from employees acknowledging and even admitting to the existence of anti-Trump and anti-conservative bias at the social media giant.\n\nIn a tweet, Project Veritas shared a video featuring Daniel Will, a content moderator, stating, \"I think they [Facebook] are very biased with who they protect. They already shadowban, Facebook is notorious for it. They say they don't, but it's clear that people's content doesn't come up because it's been de-filtered off the queue.\"\n\nAnother video shared by Project Veritas features a Cognizant employee, Lara Kontakos, stating, \"If someone is wearing a MAGA hat, I'm going to delete them for terrorism.\"\n\nZach McElroy, a former Cognizant employee, came forward with his findings while working at the content moderation company. In a post on Medium.com, McElroy outlined the bias he perceived within the company and across Facebook. He claimed that while working at Cognizant, a graphic image of President Trump having his throat cut was allowed on the platform while memes and cartoons about former Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke were removed from the platform.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. commented on Project Veritas' video, stating, \"More truth about Facebook and the social media masters. Enough is enough, we can't let them interfere with elections any longer.\"\n\nFacebook has yet to respond to the allegations made by Project Veritas.

    " Title: Senate to Vote on Government Reopening: Political Calculations and Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - As the Senate prepares for a 12 p.m. ET vote on Monday to end the government shutdown, both Democratic and Republican leaders are engaged in intricate political calculations. Each side is weighing the political costs and rewards of prolonging the impasse against the costs and rewards of resolving it.\n\nDemocrats are grappling with the question of whether they can trust Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to hold a key immigration debate if the government reopens and a funding deal is secured. On the other hand, Republicans in the Senate are considering new steps to exploit divisions between moderate and liberal Democrats in an attempt to break down opposition to reopening the government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump faces a decision on whether he is willing to sit on the sidelines and watch as he is portrayed as an unreliable bit player in the drama. Trump, who reportedly has been closely following the shutdown on cable TV, may also have to make a leap of faith if he wants to end the shutdown, and to steel himself to go against hardline advisers and his political base to make concessions on immigration that Democrats want.\n\nTrump, in a tweet on Monday, criticized Democrats for being \"captives of their own most vehement supporters\" in a potential sign he is not yet ready to soften his position.\n\nSo far, both sides can claim political benefits from the impasse that closed down the federal government on Friday at midnight. Democrats can argue they stood firm against Trump on the fate of 700,000 people brought to the US illegally as children and whether to extend their legal status, which they could lose in March. The Democratic stand came on a weekend when tens of thousands of activists took to the streets and held women's marches and rallies directed against Trump - a sign of liberal engagement in mid-term election year.\n\nRepublicans spent the weekend taking political shots at Democrats, accusing them of closing down the government on an unrelated issue to funding federal programs. The tactic allowed Trump aides to stoke enthusiasm in his own political base and put pressure on Democratic senators facing re-election in states in November in states that Trump won in 2016.\n\nThe Senate is due to vote at noon Monday on a bill to reopen the government and fund it for three weeks. It's unclear at this point whether the plan will win over sufficient Democrats to pass. Democrats have called for a funding extension of a matter of days to ensure momentum in negotiations is maintained.\n\nFive Democrats in traditionally red states voted to keep the government open on Friday. Republican leaders will test on Monday whether those numbers will increase as the pressure mounts.\n\n\"This is their off ramp,\" a senior GOP aide involved in the talks told CNN's Phil Mattingly on Sunday night. \"We'll see if they dig in or if they want a way out.\"\n\nMcConnell offered a guarantee on Sunday that if the DACA issue was not resolved by the end of a proposed interim funding period for the government on February 8, he would hold a full debate on the issue. However, Democrats must consider whether that assurance is sufficiently concrete for them to sell to base voters who are in uproar over DACA. It also appears uncertain whether the Republican-led House would follow suit if the Senate has a debate on the issue and passes legislation.\n\nThe uncertainty over Trump's position will also weigh against a Democratic shift of position after he called for, and then rejected, a previous bipartisan deal on immigration.\n\n\"The challenge is that Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan have delegated this to the President, and - the President - can he get to yes?\" Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin told CNN's \"New Day\" Monday. \"We'll see whether he can.\"\n\nIf the Democratic grassroots perceive that their Senate leaders have caved, there could be implications at the margins for their level of enthusiasm and willingness to mobilize in November. At the same time, Democrats must bear in mind a CNN poll showing that, while there is overwhelming support for helping DACA recipients, 56% of Americans say it's not worth shutting the government down to do so.\n\nThe longer the shutdown drags on, the more red state Democrats - like Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri - risk damage by association with party leaders who the GOP says are appeasing \"illegal immigration\" by shutting down the government.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have to consider how long they are prepared to accept the picture of chaos and dysfunction in Washington that is deepening even while they control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Conventional wisdom suggests that the public is likely to punish a party in that situation - even though the GOP has done an effective job trying to shift blame to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and the Democrats.\n\nTrump, by doing little so far since Friday to publicly resolve the shutdown, also faces seeing his already compromised image as the only man who could fix Washington further tarnished. If he throws himself into a big public effort to resolve the issue and to move to a full-on solution of DACA, he could win significant political points - though he risks alienating advisers like Stephen Miller and grassroots voters in his coalition who take an uncompromising line on immigration issues.\n\nSchumer and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have complained that Trump's White House team is obstructing, rather than helping, chances of a deal. Should a big intervention by the President fail, however, he could further compromise his \"Art of the Deal\" mystique at a time when his temperament, knowledge of complicated issues, and capacity to govern is in question.",
    " Title: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders Campaign for Progressive Candidates, Stirring Controversy Among Top Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is further solidifying her position as a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old democratic socialist, is hitting the national campaign trail this week with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The duo is stumping for left-wing candidates, even as Ocasio-Cortez's rising profile continues to generate debate among top Democrats.\n\nOn July 20, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will campaign for two congressional candidates seeking to unseat Republican incumbents in Kansas: James Thompson in Wichita, and former Sanders delegate Brent Welder in the suburbs of Kansas City. Ocasio-Cortez is also set to support several progressives seeking to supplant Democratic incumbents elsewhere, causing concern among Democratic leaders and pundits who worry that her far-left politics might fracture the party ahead of critical midterm elections.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive candidate for Michigan governor, stated, \"Alexandria\u2019s victory was a proof of concept for campaigns like ours.\" El-Sayed, Detroit\u2019s ex-public health commissioner, is running against former Democratic State Sen. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has also endorsed other progressives seeking to take down incumbent Democratic lawmakers, including Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Adam Smith of Washington, and Michael Capuano of Massachusetts.\n\nIn Kansas' Republican-leaning 4th District, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will team up on Friday, Thompson came close to winning in a special election last year, and is taking his second shot at unseating GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Meanwhile, far-left Welder is running against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, whom President Trump endorsed on Twitter this week as someone who has voted for \" $5 Billion for Border Security\" and who \"loves our Military and Vets.\"\n\nWelder, who worked as a labor lawyer and advocates for a $15 minimum wage and a \"Medicare for All\" platform, has polled ahead of Yoder, and his 3rd District went to Hillary Clinton by a slim margin in 2016.\n\nPrimaries in both Kansas and Michigan take place on Aug. 7. Thompson expressed his excitement about the progressive pair's visit, stating, \"It\u2019s a huge boost to our campaign to welcome Senator Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to Wichita. The interest and enthusiasm here has been electric.\"\n\nHowever, top Democratic leaders have expressed growing concern about Ocasio-Cortez's influence. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., charged this week that Ocasio-Cortez was overly idealistic, stating, \"Meteors fizz out.\" He added, \"You come up here and you\u2019re going to be buddy-buddy with all the folks or you\u2019re going to make them do certain things? Ain\u2019t happening, O.K.?\"\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., stated that Ocasio-Cortez's public feud with longtime Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., even after she defeated him in a shocking primary contest last month, was upsetting Democrats in the House. \"She\u2019s not asking my advice,\" Pascrell said. \"I would do it differently, rather than make enemies of people.\"\n\nRep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., who is facing a primary challenge from the left by community activist Cori Bush, who has Ocasio-Cortez's backing, was more direct. \"Once an election is over and you win, why are you still angry?\" Clay asked. \"I think it\u2019s a lack of maturity on her part, and a lack of political acumen, for her to be that petty.\"\n\nFormer Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000, echoed these sentiments in an interview on Wednesday. \"When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she\u2019s a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,\" Lieberman said. \"If her win makes her into what Kellyanne Conway called the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future.\"\n\nLieberman wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling for voters to reject Ocasio-Cortez in the November elections.",
    " Title: Reflecting on the Battle of Okinawa: A Journey to Hacksaw Ridge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the East China Sea, on the Japanese island of Okinawa, lies a place of stark contrast - a site of brutal warfare during World War II and a symbol of peace and tranquility today. On a hot summer day, a father and son, leaving the comfort of air-conditioning, found themselves on the infamous Hacksaw Ridge, or Maeda Escarpment, a name given by U.S. Marines who fought here.\n\nOkinawa, one of 6,852 Japanese islands, is the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, stretching seventy miles long and averaging seven miles wide. Despite its current state of freedom and prosperity, Okinawa was the stage for some of the fiercest fighting during World War II. Apart from the American and Japanese military casualties, as many as 150,000 Okinawan civilians lost their lives in the Battle of Okinawa.\n\nThe United States, a global power, carries a dual identity - generous and good-natured, an exporter and defender of freedom, yet a bully exporter of cultural leftist agendas, promoting controversial topics such as homosexuality, abortion, and questionable aspects of American society. However, on Okinawa, America represents the Dr. Jekyll, the good America, a symbol of freedom and democracy.\n\nStanding on the edge of the Hacksaw Ridge, one can barely imagine the bloodshed and chaos that once engulfed this peaceful, green landscape. The beautiful coastline, now dotted with hotels, resorts, and industry, was once filled with battleships and landing craft. The fighting in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II was particularly savage, with the Battle of Okinawa matching the ferocity of the Eastern Front between Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nWalking the battlefields, from Hastings and Normandy to Marathon and the Cu Chi Tunnels, there was something especially brutal about the fighting in the Pacific. E.B. Sledge's classic memoir, \"With the Old Breed,\" offers a glimpse into one man's personal horror on this and other islands.\n\nStatistically, the Battle of Okinawa was significant. According to historian George Feifer, 22,000 tons of materiel were delivered to Iwo Jima daily during the battle, which is only 15% of the total necessary to sustain soldiers on Okinawa. The invasion force consisted of 1,457 ships covering more than thirty square miles of ocean and involved roughly half a million men. In contrast to the cross-Channel Overlord invasion, forces for \"Operation Iceberg,\" the code name for the Okinawa invasion, were deployed from bases in San Francisco (6,200 miles away) and Pearl Harbor (more than 4,000 miles away). By the time the Battle of Okinawa was over, 14,000 American boys had made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe American forces, with perseverance and a steely determination, fought the fanatical Japanese forces, from one bloody Pacific rock to another, until they had defeated them and supplanted the evil ideology that had produced such fanaticism in the first place. The success of their efforts can be seen in modern Japan, a democratic and peaceful nation that is envious of America's way of life and freedom.\n\nVisiting Hacksaw Ridge and the beaches that saw Americans drive a stake through the heart of Japanese fascism, one cannot help but be reminded of the words of Pericles, \"We do not covet their territory or their properties; but we covet only what is our own, and what is our own we will defend.\" The Battle of Okinawa serves as a stark reminder of the cost of freedom and the importance of standing firm against ideologies that threaten peace and democracy.",
    " Title: Illinois Emergency Rooms Witness Surge in Cannabis-Related Incidents Following Recreational Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Illinois' legalization of recreational marijuana on January 1, 2020, emergency rooms across the state have reported a significant increase in cannabis-related incidents. As of now, eleven states and Washington D.C. have legalized marijuana for adult recreational use, while thirty-three states have legalized it for medical purposes only.\n\nDr. Trevonne Thompson, an emergency room physician and toxicology director at the University of Illinois at Chicago hospital, has reported a surge in cannabis-related incidents since the new year. \"I've worked several shifts since the new year has started, and I'm seeing a cannabis-related incident just about every shift that I have worked so far,\" he stated.\n\nThompson noted that novice marijuana users are coming into the hospital at the highest rate. \"Folks that have not used in a long time or are now just deciding to try it because it is legal,\" he explained. He also pointed out that law-abiding baby boomers and others in their middle-aged years who may have tried marijuana decades ago and have not touched it since are in for a rude awakening. Today's newer strains of pot are typically much more potent than those of years past, meaning they contain higher percentages of THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana that gives the \"high\" sensation.\n\n\"So perhaps before a couple of puffs was enough to get you the effect that you were looking for,\" he said, \"And now perhaps a little less can get you what you were looking for, and now some adverse symptoms.\"\n\nThe most common symptoms are heart palpitations, anxiety, and restlessness, but they can be more severe. \"In some cases, we are seeing full-on psychosis, agitation, and hallucinations,\" Thompson said. Sometimes patients require sedation, but each case is different, and the amount of cannabis consumed largely dictates the treatment.\n\nIllinois is not alone in the surge of marijuana-related hospital visits following its legalization for recreational use. According to multiple studies, Colorado doctors saw close to triple the number of cannabis-induced emergency room cases after it was legalized for recreational use there. Doctors say edibles tend to cause the majority of issues. Edibles are food products that contain cannabis and are typically consumed at a faster rate than smoking it. Examples of edibles include gummie candies and other sweets. Consuming marijuana in edibles often causes a delay in experiencing the effects of the THC, during which time the user consumes more of the product.\n\n\"By the time the first dose kicks in, you have a lot in your system that is circulating,\" said Dr. Thompson. \"You can get yourself into a situation where you have more of the product that you would have liked and you start having symptoms.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Criticism of Sessions and the FISA Investigation: A Closer Look at the Attorney General's Internal Investigation Request\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Trump has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for requesting an investigation into potential FISA abuse, calling the move \"DISGRACEFUL!\" and questioning the impartiality of the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. The president's comments come amid ongoing investigations into the use of government's national-security surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThe background of the situation involves the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee investigations of possible abuse of FISA by top FBI and Justice Department officials. The Nunes memo and the Grassley-Graham memo allege that these officials presented suspect evidence and failed to be truthful to the FISA court.\n\nAttorney General Sessions announced on Tuesday that he had asked Inspector General Horowitz to investigate the conduct of FBI and Justice Department officials in the FISA court proceedings. Sessions' decision demonstrates a commitment to addressing the allegations seriously and in accordance with the rules.\n\nWhen there are allegations of wrongdoing by Justice Department or FBI officials, federal law and Justice Department protocols require an internal investigation by the units that exist for that purpose \u2013 the Office of the Inspector General or the Office of Professional Responsibility. Sessions' referral to the IG is in line with these standards.\n\nHorowitz, the inspector general, has earned a reputation for probity and fact-driven independence. Although he was appointed to the post by President Obama, he is a career prosecutor who has been assigned to high-level positions by administrations of both parties, and he has won the respect of congressional Republicans \u2013 some of whom rushed to his defense after Trump's outburst.\n\nAs for the report on former FBI director James Comey, it is not late. It is said to be imminent and was always expected to be filed in the March\u2013April time frame. However, Trump's criticism of the investigation may cast doubt on the report's impartiality, potentially undermining its credibility.\n\nThe same is true of the investigation of FISA abuse. Some have suggested that the appointment of a strong United States attorney from a district outside Washington to conduct a full-blown probe of the investigations that became intertwined in the politics of the 2016 election would be beneficial. This probe would examine whether the Clinton emails and Trump-Russia investigations were conducted evenhandedly, whether decision-making was driven by partisanship rather than evidence, and whether not only Justice Department protocols but criminal laws were broken.\n\nHowever, such a probe will be discredited from the start if it is politicized, or perceived as such. Meanwhile, with vital Justice Department leadership positions already unfilled, the Department's No. 3 official has just resigned after less than a year in office. With a razor-thin majority in the Senate after Republicans managed to lose the Alabama seat Sessions held for two decades, it has become a difficult feat to confirm Trump nominees. Is now really the moment for the president to be trying to drive his attorney general out the door?\n\nIn conclusion, the ongoing FISA investigation and the president's criticism of Attorney General Sessions have raised questions about the impartiality of the investigation and the future of the Justice Department's leadership. It is crucial for all parties involved to maintain a neutral and fact-driven approach to ensure the integrity of the investigation and the rule of law.",
    " Title: Comprehensive Report Reveals Extensive Use of Major Social Media Platforms in 2016 US Election Disinformation Campaign\n\nA new report, released today by the US Senate, has unveiled the extensive use of various social media platforms, including YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, PayPal, Facebook, and Twitter, in the Russian disinformation campaign that aimed to influence the 2016 US election. The report, compiled by the University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project and social network analysis firm Graphika, is the first analysis of millions of social media posts provided by Twitter, Google, and Facebook to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe report exposes the scale of Russian disinformation efforts, revealing that the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company with ties to the Russian government, spearheaded a vast campaign. The IRA is known as a \"troll farm\" and was among the three companies indicted earlier this year as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe report suggests that Russia had a particular focus on targeting conservatives with posts on immigration, race, and gun rights. Additionally, there were efforts to undermine the voting power of left-leaning African-American citizens by spreading misinformation about the electoral process.\n\nThe report details a campaign called Black Matters US, which existed across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Tumblr, and PayPal. These various accounts would promote each other's posts and events. When Facebook suspended the group on its platform, the group's Twitter account complained about the move and accused the social network of \"supporting white supremacy.\"\n\nThe report indicates that all messaging in the campaign clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party and specifically Donald Trump. The report states, \"Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract, and ultimately discourage members from voting.\"\n\nThe data used by the researchers was provided by Facebook, Twitter, and Google, but the report criticizes the \"belated and uncoordinated response\" from these companies to Russia's disinformation campaign. The researchers highlight details that could have led internet companies to detect interference earlier, such as the use of the Russian rouble to buy advertisements and internet signatures relating to the IRA's base of operations.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to Russia's Embassy in the UK for comment. The IRA was among the three companies indicted earlier this year, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Twelve of the agency's employees faced indictment charges, as well as its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nThe report concludes by stating, \"Social media have gone from being the natural infrastructure for sharing collective grievances and coordinating civic engagement, to being a computational tool for social control, manipulated by canny political consultants and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Implementation of Trump Administration's Green Card Wealth Test Amidst Ongoing Legal Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to implement its new wealth test for green-card applicants, a policy that has been blocked in a federal district court since last year. The latest decision follows a similar pattern of the Supreme Court supporting the Trump administration's immigration policies that have faced challenges in lower courts.\n\nThe new rule, announced last August, could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants by denying green cards to those deemed likely to need public assistance such as food stamps, Medicaid, or housing assistance over 12 of the next 36 months. Factors considered include family size, English proficiency, credit score, and income, among others.\n\nInitially, the policy was blocked in a federal district court in New York, with Judge George Daniels stating that the rule has \"absolutely no support in the history of US immigration law\" and is \"repugnant to the American dream.\" After an appeals court upheld the injunction, the Trump administration sought the Supreme Court's intervention.\n\nIn his four-page statement, Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, expressed frustration with the practice of district judges issuing universal injunctions that apply nationwide. Justice Gorsuch argued that these injunctions dictate how the government must treat people who are not parties to the case, causing chaos and being \"patently unworkable.\"\n\nHowever, the use of broad injunctions, according to legal experts, is not a recent phenomenon, with some tracing the practice back to the 19th century. The debate revolves around when such injunctions are appropriate, but it is \"almost laughable\" to argue that they are unconstitutional, says Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision allows the Trump administration to move forward with the wealth test implementation while the litigation continues. The case is expected to raise further questions about the use of broad injunctions in the spring, with a case involving carve-outs to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act set to be heard.",
    " Title: US Deploys 1,500 Troops, Aircraft Carrier, and Missile Defense System to Middle East in Response to Iranian Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is deploying approximately 1,500 troops, fighter jets, drones, and other weaponry to the Middle East in response to the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, according to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. The move comes after a series of incidents in the Gulf of Oman that have raised tensions between the two nations.\n\nIn a statement, Shanahan said Congress had been notified about the plans. He also announced the deployment of additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, a team of engineers, a fighter aircraft squadron, and a Patriot missile-defense system.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the move earlier on Friday, describing it as \"relatively small.\" He also said the extra troops would be \"mostly protective.\" Tensions have been escalating in recent weeks, with the US already deploying an aircraft carrier and bomber planes to the region.\n\nHowever, Trump had previously stated that he did not think more troops would be needed. \"I don't think we're going to need them,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"I really don't. I would certainly send troops if we need them.\"\n\nShanahan said he had \"approved a request from the combatant commander for additional resources\" in the region. He explained that the move was intended to \"safeguard US forces given the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, including the IRGC [Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps] and its proxies.\"\n\nThe IRGC is the most elite military unit in Iran. Last month, the US designated it as a foreign terrorist organization. Shanahan also said that \"additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft\" would be deployed, as well as a team of engineers, a fighter aircraft squadron, and a Patriot missile-defense system.\n\nThe deployment of surveillance planes, both manned and unmanned, will allow a clearer assessment of Iranian activity, such as the alleged attacks on commercial tankers and any troop movements along the coast. The additional Patriot missile batteries will give the US significant capabilities to counter any threat from the air, be that missiles or aircraft.\n\nIt is unclear whether there is a settled view in Washington about the nature of the increased threat from Iran and what should be done about it. Despite some tough rhetoric, the president has appeared reluctant to become overly entangled in the region.\n\nTensions between the US and Iran began rising this month when Washington ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue.\n\nIran has now announced it will suspend several commitments under the nuclear deal it signed with six nations. Four oil tankers were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said were sabotage attacks, while drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline. Iran has denied it was behind the incidents.\n\nRear Admiral Michael Gilday, director of the US Joint Staff, accused the IRGC of being directly responsible for the attacks on the shipping in Fujairah, part of the UAE. \"The attack against the shipping in Fujairah, we attribute it to the IRGC,\" he said on Friday, explaining that limpet mines used in the attacks had been linked directly to the IRGC.",

The ad, which features Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and accuses the whistleblower process as a \"coup,\" was also targeted to air on Turner Sports.\n\nSimilarly, the Biden campaign's ad, titled \"Biden Corruption,\" was rejected by Fox News for making false claims about Vice President Biden offering Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son.\n\nCNN's rejection of the Trump ad comes after the network refused to air an ad from the same campaign that targeted some of its journalists, including Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, and Jim Acosta, and made assertions that have been proven false by various news outlets, including CNN.\n\nThe Trump campaign has criticized CNN's decision, with spokesman Tim Murtaugh stating, \"CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it's not surprising that they're shielding him from truthful advertising too.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden campaign has urged Fox News to follow CNN's lead in rejecting the Trump campaign ad. In a letter to Fox News General Counsel Lily Chaffee, Campaign Manager Greg Schultz wrote, \"We are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the ad's claims, and we expect that you will reject it.\"\n\nThe networks' decisions to reject the ads come as both campaigns ramp up their advertising efforts in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have announced a $10 million blitz to push back against the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, with the ads being run on TV and social media, including Facebook.\n\nFacebook's Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, stated last week that politicians would be generally exempt from their fact-checking program, as they do not believe it is an appropriate role for them to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience.",
    " Title: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox Blames U.S. Drug Consumption for Border Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview on Wednesday, former Mexican President Vicente Fox suggested that the drug trafficking and violence at the U.S.-Mexico border are not primarily caused by Mexico, but by drug consumption in the United States.\n\nDuring the interview, Fox stated, \"Drug trafficking, people here in the [United] States say, 'These Mexicans have gone crazy. They're killing each other all day, violence and killings. Have they been drinking too much tequila?'\"\n\nHe continued, \"No, we're in a drug war that is not ours. We don't produce drugs significantly. Maybe Donald [Trump] should know that the state of California produces more marijuana than all of Mexico together.\"\n\nFox further explained, \"Mexico does not consume drugs significantly. Here in this nation, about five percent of people consume drugs every day. In Mexico, the consumption is 0.0001.\"\n\nHe argued, \"We don't have a consumption problem. Then, the question, why the war? Why the killings? It's because we are in between those that consume the drugs here in the north in the United States and those who produce the drugs south, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia.\"\n\nFox also criticized the U.S. government for paying the Mexican government to help patrol the border and stop drug trafficking, stating, \"We're paying the price.\" He added, \"I would have never taken those $500 million. The cost of that war is much more than the loss of one life.\"\n\nThe former president, who is an activist for legalizing marijuana, also commented on the economic implications of the drug trade, stating, \"This market generates $55 billion U.S. dollars... And where do they go? That money is laundered and that money goes to the cartels\u2014and I ask this nation, who does the laundering?\"\n\nFox also took aim at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, criticizing his statements about crime on the border. He challenged, \"So all this talking about homicides [and] violence in Mexico, the one that Trump criticizes, is produced here.\" He concluded, \"Let's get rid of that language of hate that this campaign has brought about, that's not United States. United States is a great nation.\"",
    " Title: ACLU Files Discrimination Complaint Against Republican Candidate Peter Meijer Over Refusal to Host Drag Show\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a complaint against Republican congressional candidate Peter Meijer, 31, for refusing to host a drag queen performance at a venue he owns, featuring a group of performers with Down syndrome known as \"Drag Syndrome.\"\n\nMeijer, who is running for the seat currently occupied by Rep. Justin Amash in Michigan, stated his decision was based on concerns that the performers might be exploited.\n\nThe ACLU filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, alleging discrimination based on disability and sex, according to The New York Times. Jay Kaplan, a staff attorney at the ACLU Michigan chapter, suggested the complaint was primarily filed due to the drag component.\n\n\"If members of the group were to perform an orchestra recital, chances are he wouldn't have canceled the performance,\" Kaplan said.\n\nMeijer told the Times that he did not make the decision lightly, consulting with numerous individuals, including members of the disability advocacy community, parents of children with Down syndrome, members of the L.G.B.T. community, and national groups dedicated to Down syndrome.\n\nMeijer's main concern was whether the participants could give full, informed consent. In a letter regarding his decision, Meijer wrote, \"The involvement of individuals whose ability to act of their own volition is unclear raises serious ethical concerns that I can not reconcile.\"\n\nMeijer added, \"The differently abled are among the most special souls in our community, and I believe they, like children and other vulnerable populations, should be protected.\"\n\nDisArt, a production company focused on artists with disabilities, criticized Meijer for allegedly discriminating against the performers due to their disability.\n\n\"Exclusion is discrimination, it is self-preservation, it is exploitation for political gain. It is not protection,\" the statement from DisArt said. \"We are deeply saddened, angered, and appalled at the decision to exclude Drag Syndrome.\"\n\n\"DisArt WILL protect the artists of Drag Syndrome by protecting their rights,\" the statement continued. \"There will be another venue announced soon, and on September 7th, as part of Project 1 by ArtPrize, Drag Syndrome will perform in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We hope you will be there to celebrate, to learn, to grow, and to build a stronger, more inclusive community for all.\"\n\nMeijer expressed bewilderment at being labeled an ableist or a transphobe by critics of his decision.\n\n\"I have been called a bigot, an ableist, a homophobe, and a transphobe,\" the candidate told the Times. \"I fundamentally don't understand how someone can take my very good faith concern about the potential for exploitation and spin that into discriminating against people with a disability.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, Meijer could face a fine for denying his venue if the complaint were to be considered valid.",
    " Title: Howard Schultz Faces Criticism Over Potential Independent Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump took a swipe at the potential presidential candidacy of businessman Howard Schultz on Monday, even as critics fear an independent bid by the former Starbucks CEO could help Trump in his re-election bid.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump criticized Schultz, saying, \"Howard Schultz doesn\u2019t have the 'guts' to run for President!\" Trump also claimed that America already has the intelligence he referred to, and joked about the possibility of Starbucks still paying him rent in Trump Tower.\n\nDuring an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, Schultz, a longtime Democratic donor, said both the Democratic and Republican parties are failing the American people, and that Trump has proved he is wholly unqualified to be president.\n\nSchultz, 65, said, \"I have a long history of recognizing I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled.\"\n\nPolitical consultants from both parties praised Schultz's business background, but said an independent bid would likely split the anti-Trump vote with the Democratic nominee, giving the incumbent a better chance to win re-election.\n\nRepublican consultant Mike Murphy, a Trump critic, tweeted of Schultz, \"I admire the guy and think his intentions are completely honorable but if he runs his campaign slogan really should be, 'Schultz: The Independent Vote-Splitting Leadership Trump Needs Now' # WakeUpAndSmellTheCoffee.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Mark Mellman also urged the businessman not to make the race. \"Mr. Schultz, the honest truth, is that despite your achievements, you have no chance of being elected POTUS running as an independent, but some real chance of throwing the general election to @realDonaldTrump,\" he tweeted.\n\nAsked about the prospect of tipping the race to Trump, Schultz told \"60 Minutes,\" \"I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas.\"\n\nSchultz also told CBS that he anticipates tweeted attacks from Trump. \"I think, like most people, I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets,\" he said.\n\nThe potential independent bid by Schultz has sparked debate among political analysts and pundits, with some arguing that it could siphon votes away from the Democratic nominee and potentially help Trump secure a second term. Others argue that Schultz's business acumen and centrist politics could appeal to voters disillusioned with both major parties.\n\nSchultz has not yet officially declared his candidacy, but has said he is considering a run as an independent. The 2020 presidential election is scheduled for November 3, 2020.",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis: Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden vs. Christine Blasey Ford's Accusation Against Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of high-stakes political allegations, two cases stand out in recent years: Tara Reade's sexual misconduct accusation against former Vice President Joe Biden and Christine Blasey Ford's allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. While both women's accounts have sparked intense debate, a closer look reveals significant differences in the level of corroboration each case has received.\n\nSeven people have corroborated details of Reade's story, with her accusing Biden of both sexual harassment and sexual assault. In contrast, Ford's accusation against Kavanaugh, which earned support from virtually every high-profile Democrat, lacked the same level of corroboration. There's no evidence that Ford and Kavanaugh ever met in high school, the time of the alleged assault, and her primary corroborating witness, Leland Keyser, ultimately said she didn't have confidence in Ford's account.\n\nOther than Keyser's account, the biggest piece of corroborating evidence Ford had against Kavanaugh was the result of discussions nearly 30 years after the alleged assault was said to have taken place. Notes from therapy sessions Ford and her husband had in 2012 and 2013 show that she discussed an alleged high school assault, though she didn't name the alleged perpetrator. Other friends said they'd had discussions with Ford about the alleged assault, though not before 2012.\n\nThe latest piece of evidence in Reade's case came in the form of a 1996 court document showing that Reade's now ex-husband said she had told him that she had been a victim of sexual harassment while working in Biden's Senate office in 1993. That revelation came three years after the alleged assault. Reade's husband is at least the seventh person to say they heard part or all of Reade's story decades ago.\n\nReade's ex-neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, said Reade alleged to her in the 1990s that her boss in Washington, D.C., had sexually assaulted her. Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, also corroborated details of Reade's account and said she had told their mother about the alleged incident. Moulton's position is backed up by the fact that Reade's mother appears to have referenced her daughter's alleged issues at Biden's office while calling into a 1993 \"Larry King Live\" episode.\n\nLorraine Sanchez, who worked alongside Reade in the mid-1990s for a California state senator, said that Reade had complained to her that her former Washington, D.C., boss had sexually harassed her. Two anonymous friends of Reade have also backed up her story.\n\nReade's case against Biden hasn't been without criticism. As with Ford, aspects of her story have provided ammunition for doubters. Skeptics have pointed out that the story Reade told to journalists changed over time, escalating from a sexual harassment accusation to a sexual assault accusation. Three former Biden aides who Reade says she told about alleged harassment from Biden have denied her account.\n\nThe difference between Reade's account and Ford's is that while both gave skeptics reason to question their accounts, Reade's accusation has more corroboration from third parties relatively close in time to the alleged assault than Ford's. However, the corroboration of Reade's account hasn't been enough for many high-profile Democrats to offer her the same support they offered Ford.\n\nDemocratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a prominent defender of Ford, called Reade's accusation \"ridiculous.\" Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who also showered Ford with praise, said she \"stand [s] by Vice President Biden. He's devoted his life to supporting women and he has vehemently denied this allegation.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, who said in December 2017 that any candidate or elected official \"who has engaged in sexual misconduct\" should \"step aside,\" has thrown his full support behind Biden. \"I'm very familiar with the vice presidential vetting process. They look at everything about you. They looked at the entire history of Joe Biden, his entire career,\" Perez told ABC's Martha Raddatz.\n\n\"And I'll tell you, if Barack Obama had any indication that there was an issue, Barack Obama would not have had him as his vice president. Barack Obama trusted Joe Biden. I trust Joe Biden, and those investigations have been done.\"\n\nWhile Ford's Kavanaugh accusation had issues, it was still stronger than other Kavanaugh accusations Democrats hyped against the Supreme Court nominee. Julie Swetnick, the client of disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, alleged without any evidence whatsoever that Kavanaugh was involved in gang rapes in high school. Despite that lack of evidence and despite Avenatti's track record providing good reasons to doubt him, some in the media still gave Swetnick's claims credence.\n\nAnd Swetnick's accusation wasn't even the thinnest claim against Kavanaugh to receive credulous press coverage. CNN and The Hill both spread a bombastic accusation against Kavanaugh, before later updating their coverage to note that the man who made it retracted his claim and apologized for making it. A Rhode Island man called Democratic Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office and claimed that Kavanaugh and one of the judge's high school friends, Mark Judge, had drunkenly sexually assaulted a friend of his while in Rhode Island in 1998, a transcript from a Senate Judiciary Committee interview with Kavanaugh showed. The man retracted the claim shortly after it became public and said he made a \"mistake\" in leveling the false accusation.",
    " Title: \"America's Declining Absolute Mobility: A Look at Raj Chetty's Research\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by a team of researchers led by Raj Chetty reveals a significant decline in absolute mobility in the United States over the past few decades. The research shows that children born in 1940 had a high likelihood of earning more than their parents, but for those born in 1980, this trend has significantly decreased.\n\nThe study found that for individuals born into the bottom of the income distribution, there is a higher likelihood of growing up to be less disadvantaged than their parents. However, for those in the middle 60 percent of the income distribution, upward mobility has become a \"crapshoot.\"\n\nThe research suggests that economic growth is not the primary factor contributing to this decline in mobility. A comparison of GDP growth for children born in 1980 with the rapid growth experienced by children born in 1940 shows an increase in mobility, but it still falls short of the mobility experienced by the 1940 cohort.\n\nIn contrast, if inequality had remained at 1940 levels, mobility would have been significantly higher, particularly for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution. This indicates that a more egalitarian income distribution is necessary to restore the broadly shared increase in living standards that the United States was known for in the postwar decades.\n\nWhile faster growth is generally desirable, it is not entirely clear how it can be achieved on a sustained basis. Some argue that a significant boost in growth is essentially impossible for a country like the United States that is already affluent. On the other hand, achieving a more equal income distribution through different tax and regulatory structures is technically feasible.\n\nHowever, implementing these changes in a political system that seems to be moving towards a large regressive tax cut is another matter. The study's findings suggest that upward mobility can be restored, even without bringing back the unusually rapid growth of the postwar decades.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes Natural News Page for Violating Spam Policy, Banning Far-right Conspiracy Outlet\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook on Sunday took down the page for Natural News, a far-right conspiracy outlet that boasted nearly 3 million followers. The social media giant confirmed to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday that the page violated Facebook's policy against spam.\n\nThe founder of Natural News, Mike Adams, wrote on fellow right-wing conspiracy site Infowars that his site was \"permanently banned\" from posting. He also shared his sentiments with the Gateway Pundit, another far-right site, stating that the apparent ban is evidence of a conspiracy against his website.\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on Saturday that Natural News and its founder had a history of pushing hoaxes and calling for mass arrests against the left. Prior to the ban, Natural News had more Facebook followers than Infowars at its peak. Natural News used the page to promote its unique blend of natural remedies and far-right conspiracy theories, including disinformation about vaccines.\n\nFacebook has previously taken action against similar pages, including those for Infowars\u2014a move criticized by the right as \"censorship\" by Silicon Valley. In May, Facebook issued a ban on Alex Jones, as well as far-right figures like Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos, and anti-Semitic and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. (The bans also applied to Facebook-owned Instagram.)\n\n\"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson said of the bans in May. \"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"\n\nFacebook has been taking stronger actions against conspiracy and extremist content over the past year. In August, it banned Infowars and its founder Alex Jones, although Infowars appears to have used similar-sounding pages like \"Newswars\" to promote its content after the ban.\n\nFacebook also began taking stronger actions against anti-vaccination hoaxes this year, banning anti-vax ads in March. Those ads previously targeted women in measles-stricken areas, The \u2588\u2588\u2588 revealed.",
    " Title: Facebook Takes Steps to Combat Fake News, Enlists Third-Party Fact Checkers and Improves Detection Systems\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to mounting criticism over its role in the spread of fake news, particularly during the U.S. presidential election, Facebook Inc. has announced a series of measures aimed at addressing the issue.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, addressed the concerns in a post on Friday, outlining several projects already underway. He emphasized the need to strike a balance between encouraging free expression and preventing the dissemination of false information.\n\nFacebook is considering labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or the community, providing a warning to users before they read or share such content. The company is also working to simplify the process of reporting fake news and enhancing its technical systems to better identify such articles.\n\nIn addition, Facebook is seeking collaboration with journalists to understand their verification processes and exploring partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations. Zuckerberg acknowledged that fake news has become a lucrative business and mentioned that the social media giant is investigating ways to disrupt the economics of it.\n\nZuckerberg's remarks follow his earlier statement that it was \"crazy\" to suggest that fake news on Facebook influenced the election outcome. However, as criticism of his handling of the issue grew, and even President Barack Obama spoke about the negative impact of fake stories on social media, Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook's commitment to resolving the issue.\n\n\"Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community, and we are committed to getting this right.\"",
    " Title: \" Navigating the Future of Education: A Look at the Challenges and Solutions for Reopening Schools Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the question of when and how to reopen schools has become a pressing concern. Last week, President Trump urged governors to consider reopening schools as part of a broader economic revival strategy. However, most schools in the United States are expected to remain closed for several more months.\n\nA total of 45 states, along with Washington D.C., have ordered or recommended school building closures through the end of the academic year, with a focus on potentially resuming in-person instruction in the fall. The shift to distance learning has had significant impacts, with students, particularly those in vulnerable groups, missing out on crucial academic and social development. Many parents are also finding it challenging to work without a reliable place to send their children daily.\n\nExperts agree that reopening schools will be a crucial step in returning the country to normalcy. Optimistic forecasts suggest schools could safely reopen on time in the fall, though day-to-day instruction will likely look very different. A vaccine is not expected to be widely available for another year at the earliest, meaning the coronavirus will remain a threat throughout the next school year. Most models for a return to instruction call for social distancing measures to protect students, teachers, and parents at home from infection. Suggested changes include limiting class sizes, staggered schedules, and a blend of online and in-person learning.\n\nThe next few months will provide valuable insights into the viability of reopening schools. There is evidence that the virus poses less risk to young children than adults. Some epidemiologists suggest there is reason to believe children are also less likely to pass the virus on to others, though more research is needed to confirm this. The U.S. will also learn a great deal about the impact of reopening from schools in other countries, some of which are already bringing students back.\n\nHowever, there are significant logistical hurdles to overcome before schools can open. The biggest challenge is the lack of resources, with many of the country's 13,000 school districts already struggling to operate before the pandemic. The economic downturn caused by the virus will only exacerbate these issues, making it difficult to provide enough space and staff to enact distancing measures. Any plan to return will also need to be approved by teachers' unions, who have suggested they would strike if proper safety measures were not in place when schools reopen.\n\nSome argue that schools should only reopen when testing is widely available and technology to effectively track outbreaks is in use, even if that takes beyond the start of the next school year. A number of national education associations have banded together to lobby Congress for $200 billion to prop up state budgets and ensure schools have the resources to reopen safely. Funding for states is expected to be a major point of debate as lawmakers in Washington consider yet another massive stimulus bill in the coming days and weeks.\n\nIn conclusion, whenever students do return, classes are unlikely to resemble the school days they remember. There may be staggered half-day classes or one-day-on, one-day-off schedules to spread out desks and keep buses running half-empty. As the nation moves forward, the availability of testing and the development of effective tracking technology will play a significant role in determining when and how schools can safely reopen.",
    " Title: U.S.-Iran Tensions: Trump's Strike on Soleimani and the Road Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the U.S. strike on Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani, the political landscape surrounding U.S.-Iran relations remains uncertain. In a statement, Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) suggested that President Trump's actions have placed the U.S. in a strong negotiating position, with Iran's foreign minister indicating a readiness for diplomatic engagement. However, many Democrats view Trump's strike as another example of his unpredictable foreign policy, with concerns about the long-term implications for a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) stated that a classified briefing on Wednesday provided a better understanding of the reasons behind the timing and execution of the strike. Yet, to most Democrats, the U.S. is in a worse position than a week ago, with Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) expressing concern that Trump's legacy could be a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nThe potential for further escalation between the U.S. and Iran remains a significant concern, with experts warning of possible missile attacks, cyberattacks, and proxy attacks on U.S. allies. The Department of Homeland Security has warned that an attack on U.S. soil may come with little or no warning.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, stated that Iran will continue to seek opportunities to confront the U.S. and is currently on an \"escalation glide path.\"\n\nTrump administration officials argue that the president's approach has improved the U.S.'s stance on Iran compared to the previous administration. The killing of Soleimani, they claim, sent a clear message to the Iranian regime, deterring future attacks from Iran-linked groups.\n\nSupporters of the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign argue that, despite the 2015 nuclear deal, the U.S. and Iran were always on a collision course. Now, as the two countries engage in direct confrontation, the U.S. is dealing with an economically weakened Iranian regime.\n\nWithin the Republican Party, there was a general sense of relief on Wednesday, with Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) praising Trump's address on the matter. However, the long-term outcomes of the strike depend on Iran's actions, Romney noted. Romney also stated that he does not believe there is any interest on the part of the president to go to war with Iran.",
    " Title: Congress Fails to Renew Federal Funding, Triggering Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night session on Tuesday, Congress adjourned without renewing funding for the federal government, leading to the commencement of a government shutdown across the nation. The Senate was the first to adjourn, while the House followed suit shortly after 1 a.m. Despite efforts to find a middle ground, a deal to continue funding into fiscal year 2014 remained elusive.\n\nThe White House Budget Office issued an order just before midnight to initiate the closure of non-essential services, affecting approximately 800,000 federal workers who will be placed on furlough, and leaving hundreds of thousands more employees to report for work without the guarantee of paychecks.\n\nOne program that will continue to operate is the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The president's health care overhaul is funded through separate laws and, despite the shutdown, is operational as of Tuesday morning. Americans without health insurance can now access state-based exchanges to begin shopping for insurance, often with the benefit of government aid.\n\nThe debate between House Republicans and Senate Democrats raged throughout the day, with the House sending multiple proposals over to the Senate, but never the one plan senators demanded: a funding bill with no strings attached.\n\nAs the midnight deadline passed, Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) stated on the House floor, \"It is now midnight, and the great government of the United States is now closed.\"\n\nPresident Obama increased the pressure by releasing a video message early Tuesday morning, addressing American troops, in which he blamed Congress for letting the military down. \"It has failed to pass a budget and, as a result, much of our government must now shut down until Congress funds it again,\" he said.\n\nA last-ditch House plan to request formal talks with Senate Democrats was met with derision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who stated there will be no negotiations with the threat of a shutdown still looming.\n\nAt stake are most basic government operations, including national parks, federal agencies, and delays in processing new benefit applications for various programs. However, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, the military, and federal law enforcement will remain on the job, though without paychecks in the near term, except for the troops.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner emerged after a final House vote, stating, \"We are hoping the Senate will take our offer.\" House Democrats, on the other hand, claimed the GOP's push for talks was a smokescreen to cover the fact that Republicans wanted to force a shutdown.\n\nRepublicans denied this allegation and pointed to the three separate proposals they'd already sent to the Senate to cancel, delay, or otherwise change Obamacare, only to see each of them defeated by a unified Democratic caucus in the Senate.\n\nSenate Democrats have passed a bill to fund the government through Nov. 15 and have refused any other offers, stating they need to take a stand against what they called \"extortion\" by the GOP. \"We will not go to conference with a gun to our head,\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nRepublicans countered that if senators wouldn't even agree to talk, it showed they were the ones who wanted a shutdown. \"This is a logical next step when the House and Senate are unable to resolve our differences,\" said Rep. Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.",
    " Title: Aetna's Exit from Obamacare Exchanges Highlights Challenges in Rural Areas, Experts Offer Solutions\n\nArticle:\n\nAetna's recent announcement of withdrawing from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces in 11 states has added to the perception that the healthcare reform law is faltering. However, experts argue that the ACA has achieved significant milestones, such as providing health insurance to 20 million Americans who were previously uninsured, and reducing the projected cost of healthcare in the U.S. by $2.6 trillion compared to the 2010 government forecast.\n\nThe challenge lies in the exchange markets, where consumers choose their insurer under Obamacare. In some parts of the country, key insurers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars in these exchanges, leading to a lack of competition and, in some cases, only one insurer being available. Avalere Health, a healthcare consulting firm, forecasts that a third of the country's exchange regions may offer only one insurer in 2017.\n\nSeven states - Alaska, Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming - are expected to have only one insurer in each market-exchange region. This analysis does not account for insurers that may still enter these markets.\n\nSome experts argue that the pullout of major insurers from some exchange markets does not necessarily signal doomsday. In some cases, smaller insurers are able to compete effectively. Linda Blumberg, an expert on the exchanges at the Urban Institute, states, \"When some insurers are coming in with narrower networks, at a lower price, that's what you want. That's healthy competition, not necessarily a cause for panic.\"\n\nHowever, several issues persist. One is the imbalance of younger, healthier enrollees versus older, sicker ones in some exchange markets. Another is the higher costs of offering healthcare in remote regions.\n\nExperts suggest several solutions to address these issues. One is to expand the pool of healthy enrollees by making the penalty for not having insurance more immediate and severe, or by offering plans that young people perceive as desirable and affordable. Another is to increase federal financial support in troubled markets, or to let states take the lead in designing plans to serve their populations.\n\nThe outcome of these suggestions depends on the makeup of the next Congress and the White House, and experts suggest that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be more likely to reach a deal with Congress than Republican candidate Donald Trump, though outright repeal is unlikely.",
    " Title: Greece's Syriza Party Forms Coalition Government: Implications for the Eurozone and Future Bailout Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nGreece's far-left Syriza party, which campaigned against the terms of the nation's international bailout, has formed a coalition government with the Independent Greeks party. The new government, led by Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras, has vowed to negotiate better terms for Greece as it grapples with high unemployment and a struggling economy.\n\nSyriza, which failed to secure an absolute majority in Sunday's election, will now be able to push ahead with its agenda with the support of the Independent Greeks party, which holds 13 seats in the 300-seat parliament. Tsipras was sworn in as the new Greek prime minister on Monday.\n\nThe bailout package, worth approximately $270 billion, has allowed Greece to avoid bankruptcy but has come at the cost of severe spending cuts. The new government's agenda includes renegotiating the terms of the bailout and seeking talks directly with governments, rather than the troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund.\n\nGreece's economy has been in a state of crisis for several years, with 26% unemployment, an anemic growth rate, and a GDP that has plunged 30% below pre-financial crisis levels. One-third of Greece's population lives below the poverty line, and many people are without health insurance and other necessities.\n\nThe formation of the new government has caused uncertainty in the markets, with the Athens Stock Exchange down nearly 4% before recovering some losses. Markets across Asia and Europe were weaker, although the euro currency strengthened slightly on Monday after falling last week to its lowest level in over 11 years.\n\nThe White House congratulated the country, stating that the Greek people have taken many difficult but important steps to lay the groundwork for economic recovery. The United States will continue to support Greece and the international community's efforts to strengthen the foundation for Greece's long-term prosperity.\n\nThe new government's agenda could have implications for the eurozone and future bailout negotiations. Yields on Greece's 10-year government bonds increased 40 basis points to 8.81%, according to Bloomberg data. Some analysts believe that doubts over whether the EU bailout program will be extended could keep Greek bonds and the euro under pressure.\n\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have warned the Syriza party not to make promises to the Greek electorate that it can't keep and that the current debt arrangements must be respected. The Syriza party's victory could signal a broader shift of support away from mainstream political parties toward economic populism, which could lead to more active political pressure to pare back austerity measures within Spain and Italy.\n\nIn a statement, Syriza's financial planning official, Giorgos Stathakis, said that the new government had no plans to meet with negotiators from the troika and would instead seek talks directly with governments. The formation of the new government and its agenda could have significant implications for the eurozone and the future of the international bailout package for Greece.",
    " Title: Trump Praises Michael Cohen for Not Alleging Collusion with Russia, Criticizes Timing of Testimony\n\nIn a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, President Donald Trump criticized his former attorney Michael Cohen for lying in testimony to Congress, but found reason to praise him for not alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump called the blockbuster hearing \"fake\" and expressed disapproval of its scheduling during his trip.\n\n\"He lied a lot, but he didn't lie about one thing - he said no collusion with the Russian hoax,\" Trump said. \"I was actually impressed that he didn't say, 'well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.' He didn't say that.\"\n\nCohen testified on Wednesday, calling Trump a \"conman\" who knew in advance about the release of stolen emails aimed at hurting his Democratic rival in the 2016 election campaign. Trump criticized the timing of the hearing, stating it should not have been held while he was on an important trip.\n\n\"Having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing. They could have made it two days later or next week,\" he said. \"But having it during this very important summit is sort of incredible.\"\n\nTrump has called the investigation into possible collusion between Moscow and his presidential campaign a \"witch hunt.\" Cohen, 52, was a close aide of Trump for years, and his testimony could increase the legal and political pressure on the Republican president. However, Cohen did not appear to disclose a \"smoking gun\" that could sink his former boss.\n\nCohen said he had no direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Moscow during the election campaign. Possible collusion is a key theme of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which has been a focus during Trump's two years in office. Trump and the Kremlin have both repeatedly denied the allegation.",
    " Title: Lawyer for Stormy Daniels' Alleged Accuser Fundraising for Defamation Case Against Trump\n\nIn a recent development, Gloria Allred, the attorney representing Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Donald Trump's reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" who has accused the former President of sexual assault in 2007, has stated that she is not concerned about the motivations of donors supporting Ms. Zervos' defamation case against Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Allred, in a statement, expressed that she has no means of determining whether donors have a political agenda or are simply advocates for truth. She has been actively soliciting donations online and has sought fund-raising assistance from David Brock, a former self-proclaimed \"right-wing hit man\" who became a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton during her campaign against Mr. Trump.\n\nAs of now, Ms. Allred reported that the fundraising efforts have garnered \"just under $30,000,\" primarily in small donations. The funds are being utilized for expenses such as depositions, and have not been allocated towards legal fees, which currently stand at $150,000, according to Ms. Allred. She also clarified that neither she nor Ms. Zervos would accept any of the donated funds personally.\n\nIn an email, Ms. Allred stated, \"We certainly do not see any prospect of being paid by the fund based on the amounts donated to date. Nevertheless, we will continue to devote ourselves to Ms. Zervos's case because we believe, as does Ms. Zervos, that truth matters and that President Trump should be held accountable for his words and his actions.\"\n\nMs. Zervos initially made the allegations during the 2016 presidential campaign, and Mr. Trump dismissed them as \"made-up nonsense\" and suggested they were politically motivated. These comments formed the basis for the defamation suit Ms. Zervos filed after the election. A judge is currently deciding whether to allow the lawsuit to proceed.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach to Foreign Policy During Transition Period Causes Uncertainty and Alterations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the last week, President-elect Donald Trump has made several controversial statements on his Twitter account, including a call for the United States to strengthen and expand its nuclear capabilities, an accusation towards China for an \"unprecedented act\" in seizing a U.S. Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea, and a suggestion that the U.S. should keep the drone after its return. Trump also condemned the deadly truck rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin as an \"attack on humanity,\" and linked it to his proposed immigration ban from countries with a history of Islamic extremism. On Friday, Trump suggested that the suspect in the attack had made a religiously motivated threat, and questioned when the U.S. and other countries would \"fight back.\"\n\nTrump's pronouncements, often vague and offhand, have left the long-term impact on policy open to debate. However, his intervention to pressure Egypt to delay a United Nations Security Council vote disrupted a sensitive diplomatic negotiation and potentially undermined President Obama's final opportunity to make a statement on the stalled Middle East peace process.\n\nWhen Egypt complied, the same resolution was brought to a vote by four other countries on the Security Council: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal, and Venezuela. The U.S. largely observed the proceedings from the sidelines. On Friday morning, President Obama, from his vacation home in Hawaii, directed his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to instruct the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, not to block the resolution.\n\n\"In a practical sense, the message this sends is that the Obama administration is over,\" said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to both Egypt and Israel. \"Everybody knows this resolution doesn't carry any weight. The assumption has to be that the Israeli government will take some retaliatory measures, knowing that Trump is coming into office, and knowing that Trump tried to oppose this, they will do so with impunity.\"\n\nThis role reversal between the departing and incoming presidents has deepened what was already an unsettled moment in American foreign policy: a sense that the White House's policies towards the world's most troubled places had run out of steam and were about to change radically, but in ways that were wholly unpredictable.\n\nTrump has been respectful of his predecessor, and the president-elect's aides have said that the two men have spoken often. However, Trump has shown little patience for the traditions of the interregnum between presidents.",
    " Title: National Review Launches Anti-Trump Campaign: A Divisive Move in the Republican Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold and unprecedented move, the conservative magazine National Review has published a collection of essays from 22 right-leaning thought leaders, collectively arguing against the possibility of Donald Trump becoming the Republican Party's presidential nominee. The publication, founded by the legendary conservative William F. Buckley, follows its own critical editorial of Trump with a series of pieces questioning the businessman's conservative credentials and his suitability for the highest office in the land.\n\nThe central concern of the National Review (NR) seems to be the potential transformation of the right-wing political spectrum under a Trump presidency. The editors express apprehension that Trump's free-flowing populism could dismantle the conservative ideological consensus within the GOP, potentially relegating Buckley's ideas about limited and orderly government to the dustbin of history.\n\n\"Trump is a philosophically unmoored political opportunist who would dismantle the broad conservative ideological consensus within the GOP in favor of a free-floating populism with strong-man overtones,\" concludes the NR editorial.\n\nIt is important to note that not all contributors to the anti-Trump campaign appear to be absolute Trump opponents. Conservative commentator Erick Erickson, for instance, states that he would vote for Trump over Hillary Clinton. Several writers express personal admiration for Trump, describing him as gracious and even fun.\n\nHowever, many contributors voice doubts about Trump's conservative bona fides. They point to his past donations to Democratic candidates and his support for single-payer healthcare as evidence of his big-government leanings. Some accuse Trump of being a con artist, while others express concern about his penchant for boasting that his personality alone can solve complex problems.\n\nThe boasts, some argue, carry an authoritarian undertone, contradicting the conservative belief in limited government. Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, for instance, writes that Trump's approach resembles a \"two-bit Caesarism\" that American conservatives have traditionally disdained.\n\nAs the primary season approaches, the question remains whether the National Review's anti-Trump campaign will have any significant impact. Trump currently leads in New Hampshire and is tied in Iowa, with a clear path to the nomination. His core supporters are likely to view such criticism as further evidence of the establishment's hostility towards him, a key part of his appeal.\n\nIn response to the NR editorial, Trump tweeted, \"National Review is a failing publication that has lost its way. Its circulation is way down, with its influence being at an all-time low. Sad!\"\n\nThe anti-Trump movement's core problem may not be its silence or the lack of public criticism of Trump, but rather the lack of a viable alternative candidate. The race currently pits Trump against Ted Cruz, with no clear favorite among the establishment. As political analyst Jonathan Bernstein wrote in his Bloomberg View column, \"What is clear is that at least for now, Republican party actors have collectively failed to choose any of the remaining mainstream conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, or John Kasich \u2013 who would seem to offer an excellent chance of winning the nomination if only party actors could signal to mainstream conservative voters that one of them is the horse to back.\"",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Weigh Options to Prevent Government Funding Showdown Amidst Immigration Executive Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of President Barack Obama's anticipated executive action on immigration, Republican leaders are intensifying their efforts to prevent a government funding standoff. The move, which could potentially disrupt the passing of a long-term spending bill by Dec. 11, has prompted top Republicans to consider various legislative strategies to address the issue without jeopardizing government financing.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and their top aides and deputies are deliberating several options. These include offering a separate immigration legislation on the floor, tightening border security and demanding the president enforce existing laws; renewing the effort next year when Republicans have larger numbers in both chambers; and passing two separate funding bills\u2014a short-term bill with tight restrictions on immigration enforcement agencies, and another that would fund the rest of the government until the fall.\n\nThe leadership has not made any decisions, and is likely to weigh additional options. The House does not expect to bounce between options on the floor\u2014they will pick one, and stick with it, sources said. The strategies are all designed to prevent another standoff over funding the government, as Republicans prepare to take control of Capitol Hill in January.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, who will chair the Senate Budget Committee next year, stated, \"I think there is a growing momentum to the idea that Congress would be acting responsibly and modestly if it funds the government but simply bars the president from executing policies that Congress believes shouldn\u2019t be executed by denying funding.\"\n\nRepublican leaders have not completely given up on a funding bill that would last until next October, but the political and legislative climate is unpredictable. The White House has not told Republican leaders when it will take unilateral action, but senior aides and lawmakers have made it clear to the Obama administration that acting before Congress funds the government would backfire.\n\nThe least desirable option, according to several Republicans directly involved in planning, is a series of short-term spending bills. McConnell and Boehner desperately want to avoid a rolling set of spending fights early in the year, which would undermine their campaign promises to return Congress to regular order.\n\nIf Republican leaders have to fall back on a short-term spending bill, it is likely to last through February or March to give McConnell time to set up and start his new majority. However, the GOP clearly sees the short-term option as a losing fight. Republicans and the White House could be locked in an immigration-fueled, government-shutdown scare every two or three months.\n\nAs of now, House conservatives seem unsure of their strategy. \"We got ta look at what the president may do on immigration,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a former chairman of the Republican Study Committee. \"There\u2019s all kinds of discussions happening right now, so we\u2019ll look at a number of things.\"\n\nThe GOP leadership is growing increasingly nervous that time is short. The House is in session until Thursday, and then doesn\u2019t return until the evening of Dec. 1. That gives Congress just 10 weekdays\u2014at most\u2014to pass a government funding bill. As of now, the future of government funding and immigration policy remains uncertain.",
    " Title: White House-CNN Tensions Continue as Trump Administration Weighs on AT&T-Time Warner Merger\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing feud between the Trump administration and CNN appears to have extended to the realm of corporate mergers, as the White House's stance on the pending AT&T-Time Warner deal raises questions about the potential impact of political tensions on business transactions.\n\nAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner expressed his displeasure with CNN during a meeting earlier this year with Gary Ginsberg, a top executive at Time Warner, CNN's parent company. Kushner reportedly suggested that CNN should reduce its staff by 20% due to its coverage of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHowever, a White House official stated that Kushner's remark was not serious and was merely an attempt to make a point. The White House did not immediately respond to the Wall Street Journal's request for comment regarding the meeting.\n\nThe Trump administration's antagonism towards CNN, which has been a recurring theme since the 2016 presidential campaign, has been a source of concern for media watchdogs and free press advocates. In the past, Trump has labeled CNN as \"fake news\" and has publicly criticized the network's coverage of his administration.\n\nThe ongoing feud between the Trump administration and CNN may now have implications for a significant media merger. In October 2016, AT&T announced its intention to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion, a deal that includes premium TV channel HBO, film studio Warner Bros., and networks like CNN.\n\nBecause of the merger's size, the government must review it for antitrust reasons. In the past, Trump has expressed his disapproval of the deal, stating that it would result in too much concentration of power in the hands of a few. On Wednesday, news broke that the administration was looking to block the deal.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the administration's decision to potentially block the merger is due to its animus towards CNN or as a result of Trump's promise of a populist presidency that would be an antitrust enforcer. The Wall Street Journal notes that the administration claims politics are not factoring into the government's review of the merger, and AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson stated on Thursday that he does not believe politics are an issue.\n\nHowever, as my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote on Wednesday, it is difficult to know with Trump, given his history of lying, disregard for government norms, and disdain for the free press. Under these circumstances, any actions taken by the administration naturally fall under a cloud of suspicion, and it is easy for companies adversely impacted by the administration's regulatory decisions to raise questions about them.\n\nIn light of these developments, Kushner's remark, even if it was a joke, is no laughing matter. The potential impact of political tensions on corporate mergers raises serious questions about the role of the government in regulating business transactions and the potential for political retribution in regulatory decisions.",
    " Title: Major U.S. Corporations Form Joint Venture to Address Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) announced on Tuesday the formation of a new company aimed at reducing healthcare costs for their combined 500,000 U.S. employees. The move represents a significant challenge to the U.S.'s expensive healthcare system, which has seen mounting costs impact corporate profitability.\n\nThe new, not-for-profit venture will initially focus on technology for \"simplified, high-quality, and transparent healthcare.\" The companies did not provide specific details about their strategy but stated they are currently searching for a chief executive officer.\n\nHealthcare industry experts suggest the new entity could negotiate directly with drugmakers, doctors, and hospitals, leveraging their vast databases to better understand and control the costs of healthcare services. This could potentially undercut the industry's \"middlemen,\" including health insurers, pharmacies, and benefits managers.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett described the ballooning costs of healthcare as a \"hungry tapeworm on the American economy.\" He emphasized that the new venture does not claim to have all the answers but aims to address the issue without accepting it as inevitable.\n\nU.S. healthcare spending has been increasing annually at a rate faster than inflation, accounting for 18 percent of the economy in 2017. Corporations sponsor health benefits for more than 160 million Americans.\n\nThe new initiative grew out of discussions between Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Buffett, and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and gained momentum in recent months. The three CEOs plan for their companies to be the only clients of the joint venture, but they intend to share the strategies and technology they ultimately develop to reduce costs for the economy and the government.\n\nTraditional healthcare players have attempted to reduce costs without sacrificing profit margins. Pharmacy network CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) recently reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), arguing their combination could save money for the nation's employers.\n\nInvestors expect Amazon will disrupt the healthcare industry in a similar manner to its impact on the retail sector, fueled by recent media reports suggesting the company may enter the pharmacy business. The partnership with JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, and Berkshire, the third-largest public company globally and an insurance provider, offers new opportunities to reshape the industry, analysts said.\n\nHealth insurers providing benefits to Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire could be among the most affected. JPMorgan uses UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) for health benefits, while Amazon uses Premera Blue Cross. Express Scripts (ESRX.O), the pharmacy benefits manager, has disclosed it manages pharmacy benefits for Amazon. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Cigna Corp, and health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) were 4% to 7.2% lower at the close. Drugstore operators CVS and Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA.O), as well as Express Scripts, closed between 3% and 5.2% lower. Amazon closed up 1.4%.",
    " Title: \"Former Obama Faith-Outreach Director Criticizes Democratic Party for Secularism and Indifference to Christians\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with The Atlantic, Michael Wear, former faith-outreach director for the Obama administration, has criticized the Democratic Party for its indifference to Christians and its commitment to secularism. Wear, who served as the director of faith-based and neighborhood partnerships during Obama's presidency, has revealed that he almost quit his position after the administration dropped a pastor from the 2012 Inauguration for disagreeing with the Democratic line on gay marriage.\n\nWear's comments shed light on the Democratic Party's perceived disconnect with religious voters, particularly Christians. He attributes this disconnect to a growing secularization within the party, with younger Democrats who are less familiar with religious traditions and less inclined to engage with religious issues.\n\nWhen asked about the reason behind Donald Trump's sweeping victory among evangelicals in the 2016 election, Wear responded, \"Liberals have been trying to convince Americans, and evangelicals in particular, that America is not a Christian nation. The 2016 election was evangelicals saying, 'Yeah, you're right! We can't expect to have someone who is Christian like us. We can't expect to have someone with a perfect family life. What we can expect is someone who can look out for us, just like every other group in this country is looking for a candidate who will look out for them.'\"\n\nWear also shared an anecdote about his attempts to incorporate religious references into a faith-outreach document for Obama, only to have White House staffers question the meaning of the references. He recounted an instance where a White House official asked, \"Is this a typo? It doesn't make any sense to me. Who/what are \u2018 these \u2019?\"\n\nWear's comments are likely to generate little response from the Democratic Party, which has been criticized for its deep-rooted commitment to secularism, moral relativism, and Islamophilia. Wear's remarks echo those of Alan Dershowitz, who has also criticized the party for its perceived hostility towards Judeo-Christian traditions.\n\nThe Democratic Party's stance on religious issues has been a topic of debate within the party for years. In 2004, the open secularism of John Kerry's campaign was seen as a factor in his defeat against George W. Bush. Since then, the party has made attempts to reach out to \"values voters,\" but these efforts have been met with skepticism and criticism from both within and outside the party.\n\nWear's comments serve as a reminder of the challenges the Democratic Party faces in engaging with religious voters, particularly Christians, and the potential consequences of ignoring this demographic. The party's commitment to secularism and its perceived hostility towards religious traditions may continue to be a barrier to reaching out to religious voters, particularly in the context of the ongoing culture wars in the United States.",
    " Title: Post-Midterm Analysis: Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia Elections Offer Insights for 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent midterm elections held on Tuesday, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia provided valuable insights for the upcoming 2020 elections, with 12 months remaining. Here are some key observations:\n\n- In Kentucky, the governor's race was not an upset, as Democrat Andy Beshear's victory was not unexpected. The shift in the race's rating from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid-July by Inside Elections was indicative of Governor Matt Bevin's vulnerability.\n\n- President Donald Trump's presence was a boost, not a hindrance, for Bevin. Without a last-minute push and a visit from the President, Bevin might have lost by a wider margin. The strategy of urging Kentucky voters to view their ballots as a message to the nation was a wise move for the governor and the Republicans, but it was not sufficient to address Bevin's issues.\n\n- The impeachment process is not a silver bullet for Republicans. While it may energize the GOP base, the Kentucky results demonstrate that there is a limit to its effectiveness, and the party cannot rely on it as a panacea.\n\n- The transformation of Virginia is now complete. Just over a dozen years ago, Virginia had two Republican U.S. senators. Today, Republicans are struggling to find a credible challenger against Senator Mark Warner, and Democrats hold full control of the commonwealth at both state and federal levels.\n\n- The suburbs continue to pose a challenge for the Republicans. The latest evidence comes from northern Kentucky in the Cincinnati suburbs, where Bevin won in 2015 but Beshear won in 2019. Similarly, in northern Mississippi, the GOP margin in DeSoto County dropped from 61 points to 20 points. This trend is a continuation of the GOP's suburban problems since President Trump took office. This should be particularly concerning for President Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.\n\n- Mississippi is a red state, and State Attorney General Jim Hood, viewed as the strongest possible Democratic candidate, lost by 5 points.\n\nNathan L. Gonzales, an elections analyst for CQ Roll Call, offers these insights.",
    " Title: Obama's Re-election Prospects Threatened by High Unemployment Rate as Economy Falters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe dismal June jobs report has refocused the presidential campaign on the economy, a reality that President Barack Obama's hopes for a second term hinge on revitalizing an economy and reducing the jobless rate, which has historically proven fatal for incumbents. Since World War II, no president has won re-election with a jobless rate over 7.4 percent, a figure the economy is unlikely to reach before November. With only four reports remaining before the election, the president is running out of time to lower the jobless rate.\n\nFriday's report, which showed the economy added just 80,000 jobs in June and marked the worst quarter for job creation in two years with unemployment remaining at 8.2 percent, has significant implications. Voters tend to judge a president on recent economic trends rather than their performance over four years. While Obama has added over 4 million jobs during his term and the jobless rate has dropped from an October 2009 high of 10 percent, these achievements may not be enough to sway voters.\n\nObama's approval rating on the economy, consistently rated as the top issue for voters, has long been in dismal territory. Friday's numbers are likely to solidify the current dynamic that does not favor the White House, forcing the president to continue a negative campaign strategy that attacks Mitt Romney's business record and wealth. This approach has been effective thus far, giving Obama a slim lead in most national polls. However, it may have reduced impact as the Romney campaign and its supporters in deep-pocketed outside groups prepare to launch an unprecedented advertising blitz, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars, criticizing the president's economic stewardship and defending Romney's private sector record.\n\nThe Romney campaign is also expected to add new communications staff and is readying a fresh defense of Romney's record as head of private equity firm Bain Capital. Friday's report, which aligns with Romney's argument that Obama has not pushed the economy onto a faster track, will likely strengthen Romney's case for a new approach emphasizing lower taxes and less regulation.\n\nObama attempted to place the weak jobs number in context, highlighting the over 4 million jobs created during his term. He also continued to blame Congress for blocking policies he claims would create faster growth, such as infrastructure spending and hiring more police officers, teachers, and other public employees.\n\n\"We learned this morning that our businesses created 84,000 new jobs last month, and that overall means that businesses have created 4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months including 500,000 new manufacturing jobs,\" Obama said. \"That's a step in the right direction. But we can't be satisfied because our goal was never to just keep on working to get back to where we were back in 2007. I want to get back to a time where middle-class families and those working to get into the middle class have some basic security.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Embarks on West Coast Fundraising Trip Amidst Political Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will embark on a three-day fundraising trip to the West Coast on Wednesday, aiming to raise millions for Democratic congressional candidates. The trip, which includes five fundraisers in California, will see the President attend events hosted by executives from Disney studios, Yahoo, and the former chairman of Qualcomm.\n\nThe fundraisers are part of more than 20 events that the President has committed to attend this year, as Democrats strive to maintain control of the Senate and gain seats in the House. With his job-approval ratings at a low point, President Obama joked at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner about Democrats' perceived reluctance to campaign with him.\n\n\"Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don't really want me campaigning with them,\" Mr. Obama said. \"And I don't think that's true\u2014although I did notice the other day that [daughter] Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill Clinton. I was a little hurt by that.\"\n\nThe President's first stop will be in Arkansas, where he will tour tornado damage and meet with the families of victims, accompanied by Sen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat running for a third term in a close race against Republican Rep. Tom Cotton. The appearance with Obama is not a campaign event, but rather a tour to assess the damage caused by the tornado. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, and Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican, will also be part of the tour.\n\nLater on Wednesday, the President will fly to Los Angeles to participate in a joint fundraiser for House and Senate Democratic candidates. He will also receive an \"Ambassador for Humanity\" award from Steven Spielberg at a Holocaust memorial event sponsored by the University of Southern California's Shoah Foundation. The award recognizes President Obama's commitment to democracy and human rights, as well as his appointment of the nation's first special envoy for Holocaust Survivor Services.\n\nThe Holocaust event and another \"official\" energy-related event in San Jose ensure that taxpayers will cover much of the cost of the President's trip, despite it being primarily political in nature.\n\nOn Thursday, the President will attend four fundraisers in Southern California. His fundraising hosts include Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn, billionaire and former Qualcomm Chairman Irwin Jacobs, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Current Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs, Irwin's son, has been active in promoting President Obama's immigration reform plan, while Ms. Mayer has lobbied the administration to allow more transparency about the information requests her company receives from the National Security Agency.\n\nTickets for the events range from $1,000 per person to $64,800 per couple, depending on the event and the level of access to President Obama. Irwin Jacobs was the second-biggest donor to President Obama's 2012 campaign, contributing well over $2 million to the President's re-election effort.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party), but they are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in November. Many political analysts believe the GOP is within reach of picking up the net six seats needed to regain control of the Senate. In the House, Democrats would need a net gain of 17 seats to take the chamber, a goal that most political strategists believe the party can not achieve. Democrats are leading in the 2014 money race of \"hard\" contributions, which are subject to federal limits. However, Republicans are believed to be benefiting more from spending by outside groups that don't need to disclose their contributions.",
    " Title: Ohio Presidential Race Heats Up as Candidates Focus on Budget Deficit and China Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential campaign has intensified its focus on the crucial swing state of Ohio, with both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama holding campaign events in the state today. Ohio, a state no Republican has won the White House in modern times without, has become a battleground for the two candidates.\n\nRomney emphasized the national debt during his speech in front of a ticking debt clock, while Obama accused his challenger of newfound outrage over China policy, a subject of particular importance in Ohio, where there is sensitivity to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs.\n\nBoth candidates spent the entire day in the state, sharing turf for the first time in roughly two months. Romney's support in Ohio has been slipping, with 538 rating Ohio a \"tossup\" but shifting that to \"leans Democratic\" after a series of polls showed growing support for President Obama.\n\nThe bad news for Romney in Ohio was reinforced by public perception, in a new Quinnipiac University-Washington Post poll, that his campaign has faltered. Six in ten Americans expressed a negative opinion of how he's handling his campaign, and a majority responded unfavorably to his comments on people who do not pay income taxes.\n\nObama's ratings for handling his campaign are substantially better, 54-43 percent, favorable-unfavorable. And while ratings of Romney's campaign have grown more negative, favorable ratings of Obama's campaign efforts have gained 8 points since July, according to 538 pollster Gary Langer.\n\nAfter waking up to daunting poll numbers showing him behind by double digits in Ohio, Mitt Romney, appearing at a campaign event with golfing great Jack Nicklaus, today attempted to showcase a rare bright spot in the polls, that he leads Obama on his perceived handling of the federal-budget deficit.\n\n\"There's something else he wants to do that's the same as he's done in the past, and that is trillion-dollar deficits,\" Romney said today in Westerville, Ohio, of his differences with Obama on budget-deficit reduction. \"If he were re-elected, I can assure you it will be almost $20 trillion in debt.\"\n\nThe new Quinnipiac University poll shows that when asked who would do a better job on the budget deficit, Ohio voters preferred Romney over Obama 49 percent to 45 percent.\n\nObama took the stage this afternoon at Bowling Green State University, while Romney, 130 miles away on the opposite side of the state, hosted a business roundtable in Bedford Heights. Obama accused Republican rival Romney of \"newfound outrage\" over Chinese trade practices and disingenuous claims that he would hold the Asian power accountable.\n\n\"When you hear this newfound outrage, when you see these ads he's running promising to get tough on China, it feels a lot like that fox saying, 'You know, we need more secure chicken coops,'\" Obama told a crowd of 5,500 supporters in Bowling Green. \"I mean, it's just not credible.\"\n\nThe president sought to cast himself as a warrior for U.S. workers, highlighting trade cases his administration has brought -- and won -- against China at the World Trade Organization.\n\nA Romney campaign spokeswoman noted that Obama has refused to label China a \"currency manipulator\" and argued that the actions the administration touts have \"failed, expired or been described as mere 'peanuts' by trade analysts\" at restoring a level playing field for U.S. companies.\n\nThe candidates will then swap sides of the state, presumably passing each other mid-flight, with Romney holding a 5:30 p.m. ET event at the SeaGate Convention Center in Toledo while Obama stumps in Kent at Kent State University.\n\nThere is more than a month left in the campaign, although voters in some key battleground states start early with absentee voting this week. There are pivotal presidential debates between now and Election Day.\n\nMitt Romney has made preparation a priority, taking days off the campaign trail in recent weeks to prepare. Obama, meanwhile, has only engaged in several preparation sessions, although he plans a three-day crash course in Nevada before the first debate Oct. 3.\n\nAs 538's political director Amy Walter pointed out today, debates can mean the difference in a presidential campaign. It rarely happens, but she pointed to Gallup data showing that George W. Bush might have benefited enough from the debates to squeak into Election Day. And the rest is Supreme Court history.\n\n\"He did get some help from the Supreme Court. But, the fact remains that Bush came into the debates down 8 points to Al Gore, but came out of the debate period ahead by 4 points,\" Walter wrote today.\n\nIn advance, both campaigns this week sought to lower expectations for their debate performances.",
    " Title: Economic Uncertainty and Government Expansion: A Look at the Impact of Obama's Policies in 2013\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final months of 2012, Americans have been grappling with a sense of economic uncertainty, as the looming fiscal cliff and the repercussions of President Barack Obama's reelection have become the central focus of the nation. The economic landscape has seen a surge in gun sales, increased visits to gun shows and shops, and a flurry of activity in the stock market, as investors seek to secure their profits and estate planners report a rush of people trying to beat higher inheritance taxes.\n\nThe political climate in Washington is a significant factor in this economic turmoil. The tax-and-spending drama unfolding in the capital threatens real-world consequences for every American, as the reach and cost of government continue to expand. The \"invisible hand\" of free markets is being replaced by the \"visible hand\" of bureaucrats, with the political class now wielding significant influence over the economy.\n\nThe fiscal cliff, with its wild swings in the stock market, provides a snapshot of this new reality. President Obama's reelection secured first-term government expansions, such as ObamaCare, which carries expensive mandates and potential unintended consequences. Regardless of how the fiscal talks are resolved, the IRS will be taking a larger share of the fruits of national labor.\n\nEconomic indicators, such as housing prices and the unemployment rate, suggest that the economy is growing. However, the unemployment rate is falling primarily because millions have stopped looking for work, and ordinary wages are stagnant or falling. On the other hand, spending continues to rise, hiring is up, and the Federal Reserve's printing presses are running overtime.\n\nThe Obama administration is content to keep borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, or nearly $4 billion a day, seven days a week. Each day brings plans for added regulations and new ways to redistribute wealth. This combination creates a huge cloud hanging over every family and business, with debts and inflation exacting penalties, perhaps for generations, and stifling innovation and job creation.\n\nThe certain result will be an economic pie that doesn't grow fast enough, leading to new demands for more redistribution under the guise of \"fairness.\" The government redistributes by taking the first bite for itself.\n\nThe most disheartening aspect of this gloomy vision is that Americans voted for it. Obama was upfront about wanting to raise taxes and expand government and the debt. The reach and cost of Washington grew dramatically in the last four years, and he was rewarded with four more. It is naive to think he will change course. His rejection of any serious reforms of entitlements shows that he is emboldened.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic outlook for 2013 is uncertain, with many Americans anticipating disappointment in the face of Obama's policies. It is essential to remain informed and vigilant in these times, as the economic landscape continues to evolve.",

O'Rourke, who gained national attention during his close Senate race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, entered the presidential race with high expectations but ultimately fell short due to weak poll numbers, reduced fundraising, and a lack of a solid base of support.\n\nInitially, O'Rourke's polling numbers suggested he might be a serious contender for the nomination, with polls showing him at 10% or more shortly after announcing his candidacy. However, his numbers quickly deteriorated as the race progressed, and he spent the past few months polling below 5%. His fundraising struggles also played a significant role in his campaign's downfall. Despite raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, he managed to raise only $13 million by the end of the second quarter and added just $4.5 million in the third quarter.\n\nO'Rourke's debate performances did not help him recover either. In fact, his most recent performance seemed to have hurt him. After the October debate, O'Rourke's net favorability among Democratic primary voters fell by about 6 points in a post-debate poll with Ipsos, the biggest decline for any of the 12 candidates on stage. His place at future debates was in jeopardy, as he was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate.\n\nO'Rourke's struggle to attract a large enough base of support in the primary may be attributed to the makeup of the Democratic electorate. As a moderate three-term congressman, he won over many suburban white voters in his Texas Senate bid. However, a base of white moderates, particularly younger ones, was not enough to secure the nomination. According to data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, only about 12% of 2016 Democratic primary voters fit all three descriptors \u2013 young, white, moderate.\n\nO'Rourke's leftward pivot on issues, particularly gun control, may have also played a role in his decline in the polls. He made headlines in the September debate by calling for a mandatory gun buy-back program. It's possible that he shifted left to appeal to a broader base, but the strategy did not seem to resonate with voters.\n\nAs O'Rourke moves on from his presidential campaign, it remains to be seen where he will appear next. His exit serves as a reminder that early campaign strength does not always translate into success in the long run.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Face Internal Struggle Over Filibustering Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats are grappling with the decision of whether to filibuster President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. According to Politico, at least seven conservative Democratic senators favor an open vote for Gorsuch, while others, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are contemplating the potential repercussions of appearing obstructionist.\n\nThis internal debate is a contentious issue within the Democratic Party. While Senate Democrats have the numbers to sustain a few defections, they must filibuster Gorsuch, or any other nominee Trump appoints, as a matter of principle and to maintain a chance in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe most significant factor to consider is that this is a vacancy filled during a presidential term's final year, as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) rightly points out. Supreme Court justices have retired or died in the final year of a presidential term on numerous occasions, and presidents still managed to get their nominees confirmed \u2014 including President Reagan. However, blocking a nominee for an entire year in the hope that the next president will be from the opposing party, as Senate Republicans did with Merrick Garland, has never happened before. Indeed, Obama could have likely appointed him if he were not such a hesitant compromiser.\n\nThe norm of not filling a Supreme Court seat during the final year of a presidential term is now established. No longer will any president be able to fill a Supreme Court seat unless his or her party also controls the Senate. As Republican senators like John McCain and Ted Cruz have promised to hold the seat open throughout Hillary Clinton's entire presidency when it appeared she was going to win, Gorsuch is moving forward regardless. The filibuster will remain in place until it obstructs the Republican agenda, at which point it will be abolished. As Jonathan Chait argues, Democrats should stand up to Trump's nominee now and force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take responsibility for jamming Gorsuch into the vacant seat.\n\nThe case for all-out partisan trench war is further strengthened by the surrounding political circumstances. Donald Trump lost the popular vote by the largest margin of any president, and in an election marked by efforts at systematic disenfranchisement of African-Americans and FBI meddling on Trump's behalf. Instead of governing in a moderate fashion, Trump and his inner circle of advisers are pushing through radical, bigoted policy as quickly as possible. Most alarmingly, they are attempting to ban Muslim immigration from seven countries through executive order, and apparently directing federal law enforcement to ignore federal court orders staying the action.\n\nSometime soon, the Supreme Court will rule on the question of Trump's defiance of federal court orders, and as Tom Scocca argues, there is every reason to think that Gorsuch will behave as a \"partisan stooge.\" This raises the additional highly alarming prospect of Trump's nominee serving to legally launder his illegal actions.\n\nTo cap it all off, Trump is unpopular \u2014 and for a recently-elected president, wildly so. Trump's executive order has already caused massive chaos, and Republicans are preparing mass deportations and to throw millions off their health insurance. Ordinary liberals are beside themselves with fury, and protests (built on a foundation carefully built up over the years by Black Lives Matter and other groups) are organically springing up on a near-daily basis. And not just in New York and D.C., but also in places like Birmingham and Louisville.\n\nDemocrats will face midterm elections next year, and the Senate map for them is incredibly challenging, with many seats up in states that Trump won. However, it would be a significant mistake to think compromising with Trump is the way to win those seats. Their basic problem is turnout, and Democrats need a fervent, activist core to juice turnout of their traditional demographic groups, which have not recently turned out for midterms. But to get that core, they need to give them something to fight for.\n\nRight now, there is incredible anti-Trump energy. If Democrats want to channel that energy, they must credibly signal that they will fight Trump tooth and nail. Filibustering Gorsuch is the loudest way they can do it.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Advocates for Loretta Lynch's Confirmation as Attorney General, Discusses Political Matters at \"Politics and Pie\" Forum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance at the \"Politics and Pie\" forum in Concord, New Hampshire, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush expressed his support for President Barack Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. Bush urged the Senate to confirm Lynch's nomination, which has faced opposition from a number of Senate Republicans.\n\nDuring his speech, Bush criticized the delay in Lynch's confirmation, stating that the longer the process takes, the longer current Attorney General Eric Holder remains in office. He emphasized the importance of presidents' ability to choose their own team, and expressed the view that political considerations should not always be partisan.\n\nThe nomination of Loretta Lynch has been held up for 160 days since Obama announced his choice on Nov. 8, due to a Senate fight over a sex-trafficking bill that includes a controversial abortion provision. However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has threatened to break protocol and force a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nBush also took the opportunity to address other political matters, including a jab at Hillary Clinton's recent visit to Chipotle. He stated that he cooks at home and does not need to dine at the fast-casual chain, though he admitted to occasionally visiting Chipotle. Bush broke his strict paleo diet to enjoy some blueberry pie at the event.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Bush joked that he was not trying to break a tie between his family and the Adamses, who are the two families to have produced the most presidents in U.S. history. Bush quipped that his motivation was not to break the tie, but to prove it.\n\nThe event provided a glimpse into Bush's political views and his approach to campaigning, as he continues to consider a potential run for the presidency in 2016.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Consider Expanding Trump Tax Inquiry to Include Business Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats are deliberating whether to broaden their investigation into President Donald Trump's taxes to encompass his business tax returns, in addition to his personal returns, a move some view as essential for effective oversight.\n\nThe debate has gained momentum, according to aides and lawmakers, following last week's testimony by former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, who alleged to lawmakers that Trump manipulated his business asset values and reduced employee salaries to lower his taxes.\n\nThe testimony suggests that investigators in the House of Representatives will need both his personal and business returns to fully assess Trump's compliance with tax laws and understand the network of businesses he owns, lawmakers said.\n\nHouse Democrats have spent months preparing for an unprecedented request to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for Trump's personal tax filings. Adding Trump's business returns could complicate an already legally delicate effort, aides and lawmakers said. Trump owns more than 550 companies and business entities, including the Trump Organization, his financial disclosure reports show.\n\n\"There's conflicting advice on this,\" said Representative Richard Neal, chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and the only House lawmaker authorized by law to ask Mnuchin for Trump's returns.\n\n\"Tax policy is pretty complicated. There are times when individual returns can instruct you. Other times, you might seek a business return,\" Neal told reporters in an interview. \"It has to conform to the principle of a pretty narrow law.\"\n\nNeal is attempting to formulate his request to Mnuchin so that it can withstand a likely court fight with Trump, who has refused to release his returns, defying decades of presidential practice. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has also retained extensive business interests while serving as president, raising questions about conflicts of interest.\n\nInterest in Trump's business returns is coming from at least four other House panels, including Oversight and Judiciary, according to aides and lawmakers. House Oversight wants to depose long-time Trump tax attorney Sheri Dillon, who likely has a deep understanding of Trump's tax returns.\n\nCommittee officials said this week that no final decision has been made on whether to pursue the business returns in the initial request.\n\nCohen's testimony \"opened a lot of doors for investigatory bodies,\" Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the House Oversight Committee, told reporters.\n\n\"It's about comparing his financial statements with his tax reports. What Cohen named particularly were the Trump Organization taxes,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats, who won control of the House in the November 2018 U.S. elections, say Trump's personal returns would reveal whether he has complied with U.S. tax laws and any IRS audits, as well as his effective tax rate, business and investment income, and charitable contributions.\n\nHowever, Democrats could stumble by focusing solely on Trump's personal returns, if their aim is to identify conflicts of interest between his sprawling business investments and the policies he advocates from the Oval Office, tax experts say.\n\n\"Personal returns alone fall short,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.\n\nSuccess against legal resistance to disclosure by Trump would greatly depend on the ability of Democrats to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose for their request.\n\nRosenthal said including business returns would strengthen the House argument because the documents are geared strongly to legitimate oversight questions such as conflicts of interest.\n\nHowever, House Democrats are discussing simplifying their request by targeting a limited number of Trump companies tied to investments of interest, rather than the entire business network, and possibly making further requests later.\n\n\"It's going to be a combination of both personal and business, because he goes back and forth between both. To get the full picture, I don't think you can just pick one or the other,\" said Representative Gerry Connolly, an Oversight member.",
    " Title: Ferguson's Shift in Demographics and New Leadership: A New Era of Community-Centered Policing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the controversial shooting of Michael Brown, the small city of Ferguson, Missouri, has been undergoing significant changes. Barbara Tipsword, an 85-year-old volunteer at a local store, expressed her commitment to preserving the city's unique character, stating, \"We love Ferguson and we are here to do anything we can to keep our Ferguson the way it is.\"\n\nTipsword, a long-time resident, was taken aback by the angry protests that followed Brown's death, having previously viewed Ferguson as a model of integration. Over the last 25 years, Ferguson has transitioned from nearly three-quarters white to two-thirds black. In the 1990s, a group called Proud, which stood for People Reaching Out for Unity and Diversity, was formed to promote integration. The group's efforts, many believed, had long since been fulfilled.\n\n\"We integrated so well, I had thought,\" Tipsword reflected. \"I just didn't know.\"\n\nTipsword, while not expressing sympathy for the protesters, acknowledged a growing awareness of the anger felt by black residents towards the police. \"I guess the people of Ferguson were complacent,\" she said. \"There was another thing going on for some people.\"\n\nA new chapter in Ferguson's history began last month as Andre Anderson, a black police commander from Glendale, Arizona, was introduced as the city's new, interim police chief. Addressing a crowd at the community center, Chief Anderson emphasized his commitment to a new kind of inclusive, community-centered policing. He was joined by Ed Beasley, an African-American who had previously been the city manager in Glendale, and who had been announced as Ferguson's interim city manager a month earlier. New members of Ferguson's City Council, including two African-Americans elected in April, were also present, increasing the number of black people on the seven-member Council to three from one.\n\nThis moment marked a shift in Ferguson's public face, with city leaders under pressure to present a new image in the wake of the Justice Department's findings that the city's law enforcement policies were predatory, and that city officials stood by as some employees shared racist emails. The city is now striving to reach a settlement with the Justice Department over these issues.",
    " Title: US Government Weighs Response to Alleged Russian Cyberattacks on Political System\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The US government is grappling with how to respond to a series of cyberattacks targeting Democratic Party organizations and election registration websites, with debate raging over whether to publicly attribute the attacks to Russia.\n\nAccording to FBI and Justice Department officials, there is strong evidence to warrant publicly naming Russia as responsible for the political organization attacks, law enforcement and intelligence officials briefed on the investigation say. However, US intelligence agencies and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have expressed caution about moving to \"name and shame\" Russia, citing concerns about Russian retaliation and the potential exposure of US intelligence operations.\n\nWhite House officials are also reportedly hesitant due to the political overtones of making such an attribution weeks before the US presidential election. Some White House officials believe the FBI and intelligence agencies need to provide more definitive links between Russian intelligence hackers and WikiLeaks, the organization that published the stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAn administration official stated that there is no effort to slow down the attribution of the hacks. \"As senior law enforcement officials have said, there is an active, ongoing investigation into recent cyberintrusions against the DNC and related entities,\" the official said. \"The law enforcement and intelligence communities will reach their own conclusions in due course. Policy decisions regarding public attribution for these intrusions are contingent on the results of that investigation, which we are careful not to get ahead of.\"\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement officials believe the Russian goal is not necessarily to get a particular candidate elected, but rather to sow dissension and raise doubts about the US political system. This is similar to Russian activity in recent years in Europe, according to US intelligence and law enforcement officials.\n\nThis week, congressional leaders and staff received briefings on the sprawling US hacking investigation. They were told that there is now near-certainty that Russian intelligence is behind cyberhacking attacks against targets ranging from the DNC and other political organizations tied to Democrats to Washington think-tanks and even reporters at The New York Times, according to US officials familiar with the briefings.\n\nThe prospect of Russian hacking activity affecting confidence in the US election is a major concern for US government officials. US officials do not view the hacks of election-registration websites as a threat to the vote count, as voting machines and tabulation systems are not connected to the Internet. However, there are concerns about hackers tampering with registration data and causing voters to show up at their polling places on election day to find they are not on the voting rolls. This could amplify such issues this year and affect public confidence in the election outcome.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement, \"This is a direct provocation that goes to the heart of American democracy. Every American should be able to walk away from the ballot box and know that their voice has been heard. We can not allow such action to go unanswered, which is why President Obama should send a clear signal to intruders: attempts to influence US elections or destabilize the integrity of our electoral process will be met with severe consequences.\"",
    " Title: Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior Against Senator Al Franken: A Call for Ethics Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking revelation, KABC radio host Leeann Tweeden has accused Senator Al Franken of groping and forcibly kissing her during a USO tour in 2006. Tweeden's account, which has garnered widespread attention, describes a disturbing incident where Franken, despite her objections, aggressively kissed her and forcefully inserted his tongue into her mouth.\n\nFranken's response to the allegations has been somewhat ambiguous. He stated, \"I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it.\"\n\nThe question now is, what is the appropriate response or consequence for such gross behavior? Franken, who was 55 at the time of the incident, can hardly dismiss it as a youthful indiscretion.\n\nThe Democratic party is likely to be divided in their responses. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri has already called for an ethics investigation, stating on Twitter, \"I'm shocked and concerned. The behavior described is completely unacceptable. Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation.\"\n\nHowever, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, when asked about the Franken allegations, responded, \"You guys need to find something more interesting.\" It is worth noting that this statement was made before being asked about the Franken accusations, a fact that seems to have been overlooked in initial reports.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the Democratic party will handle this situation and whether they will uphold the standards of conduct they have been advocating for in the wake of the #MeToo movement.",
    " Title: Hurricane Irma Causes Flooding and Power Outages in Charleston, S.C., While Florida Keys Suffer Extensive Damage\n\nArticle:\n\nHurricane Irma, now a tropical depression, has caused significant problems in Charleston, South Carolina, with high winds, flooding, and power outages affecting more than 900,000 electricity customers in Georgia and South Carolina. A tropical storm warning is currently in effect for all of Georgia's Atlantic coast and most of South Carolina's coast.\n\nIn Charleston, knee-high floodwaters have coursed through the streets, with some residents navigating by kayak. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood emergency for Charleston County, and parts of the city's historic core, located on the Charleston peninsula, have been closed down.\n\nMayor John Tecklenburg stated that the city had been hit with a four-foot storm surge, leaving parts of the peninsula looking as if they had merged with the Ashley River. He explained that Charleston was in the path of two weather systems, with the counterclockwise rotation of Irma and a clockwise high-pressure rotation over the Atlantic, causing strong winds and hurricane bands to directly impact the city.\n\nFurther inland, concerns about serious damage remain high, even as the storm's power diminishes. In Atlanta, winds have caused trees to crash into residences and onto roadways, and the city's public school system has canceled classes through Tuesday. Delta Airlines has also canceled approximately 900 flights due to strong north-south crosswinds at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nIn Jacksonville, Florida, Mayor Lenny Curry has urged residents to heed warnings, as high tides will raise river waters up to 6 feet above their normal levels and cause additional flooding. The city is facing a \"trifecta\" of water-related threats: storm surge, heavy rainfall over the weekend, and Monday's rising tides.\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Bob Buckhorn reported that the city had been spared the storm's worst, with minimal flooding and manageable debris. The city was again spared from a direct hit by a hurricane, as it has been for over 90 years.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, tree limbs littered lawns, and minor debris has blown onto roads but is not stopping traffic. In Orlando, officials reported that the city had weathered the storm without major damage.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott inspected the Florida Keys on Monday from a Coast Guard aircraft, stating that the flight revealed extensive flood damage, boats washed ashore, and trailer parks filled with overturned homes. He expressed his sympathy for the people in the Keys, stating that the recovery process will be long and challenging.\n\nIn Marco Island, rescue officials are checking on people who stayed behind during the storm, which made landfall there on Sunday. There were no deaths or serious injuries reported, and the storm surge had receded by daybreak. The city is without power and water, but officials expect to be restored in a couple of days. There is minimal structural damage, and no lost homes have been reported.",
    " Title: Youthful Indiscretion vs. Assault Allegations: Experts Weigh In on Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of assaulting a girl at a house party in 1982, have sparked a national conversation on the relevance of youthful indiscretion in evaluating the character of a mature adult.\n\nRod Dreher, editor of The American Conservative, tweeted, \"I do not understand why the loutish, drunken behavior of a 17-year-old high school boy has anything to tell us about the character of a 53-year-old judge.\" Fox News commentator Stephen Miller likened the allegations to \"drunk teenagers playing seven minutes of heaven.\"\n\nHowever, experts argue that an assault such as the one alleged by Christine Blasey Ford falls outside the realm of youthful indiscretion. Ford claims Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, tried to remove her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\nScience suggests that teenagers do not have full control over their impulses, with the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for decision-making, still developing into their 20s. Teenagers often engage in risky behavior, such as binge drinking and reckless driving, but these actions are usually \"calibrated not to hurt people,\" according to Christine Nicholson, a clinical psychologist who works with adolescents.\n\nHowever, sexual assault, as described by Ford, is a hard line. \"Trying to make an argument that boys will be boys, that\u2019s just reaffirming rape myths that we know are so pervasive in our culture,\" said Katie Edwards, a psychology professor and affiliate at the University of New Hampshire's Prevention Innovations Research Center. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any scientific evidence that this person wouldn\u2019t know that what he was doing was harming another person.\"\n\nExperts noted stark contrasts between the kinds of risky teen behavior that can be attributed to immaturity and actions that indicate a deeper flaw in a person's psyche. Teenage antics are usually \"calibrated not to hurt people,\" said Sherry Hamby, a psychology professor at the University of the South. If a boy covers the mouth of a girl to drown out her screams, \"it's pretty clear that you know you do not have consent,\" she said.\n\nScreaming would be \"a sign that even a young child would notice that something is wrong,\" said Edwards. Children begin to read emotions and learn right from wrong as early as age 2 or 3. \"Trying to make an argument that boys will be boys, that\u2019s just reaffirming rape myths that we know are so pervasive in our culture,\" Edwards said. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any scientific evidence that this person wouldn\u2019t know that what he was doing was harming another person.\"\n\nUnlike binge drinking and similar actions, sexual assault is a rare offense in teenage boys, a deviant behavior, Nicholson said. \"This is not a common thing for a boy to do,\" she said. \"A boy can get drunk. A girl can get drunk. But to sexually assault someone while drunk is not a common affair.\"\n\nAlcohol's ability to lower a person's inhibitions and perpetuate crime has been well-studied. Hamby said it should not be considered an exculpatory factor for bad behavior, just as it would not be for any other crime committed while intoxicated. She would not consider age an excuse in such a case, saying it would set an abnormally low bar for teenage boys.\n\n\"It's absolutely within the capacity of (a 17-year-old) to refrain from sexually assaulting someone,\" Hamby said.\n\nIn discussing the Kavanaugh allegations, Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, asked, \"Should any of us be held liable today\u2014when we lived a good life, an upstanding life by all accounts\u2014and then something that maybe is an arguable issue took place in high school?\"\n\nSurvivor advocates noted that assaults can follow victims decades later. Of college-age men who self-reported acts that would qualify as rape, 63% admitted to repeat rapes, according to a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts and the Brown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"People who offend throughout adulthood often began those behaviors in adolescence,\" said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \"That does not mean that people who behave badly in their youth, in adolescence, all go on to do this across their lifetime.\"\n\nYouths who commit sexual assault can be reformed by taking responsibility for their offense and working through it in therapy, experts said. But that takes admitting it first.\n\n\"There would be a big difference if this guy said, 'Look, I did this. It was so godawful, and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I have never done it again' and apologized profusely,\" said Yale psychiatry professor Joan Cook.\n\nNicholson said sexual assault, even if perpetrated in elementary school, would invalidate someone from serving on the Supreme Court. \"You can't attempt to rape someone and go on to become a Supreme Court justice,\" she said. \"People don't do that.\"",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Tread Carefully on Pushing Obama for Swift Immigration Reform Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democratic leaders are navigating a delicate balance as they weigh how aggressively to push President Barack Obama on immigration reform before the midterm elections. The concern is that Obama's executive action on immigration could negatively impact the reelection bids of Democrats in red states, potentially flipping the Senate to Republican control.\n\nDespite previous calls for executive action, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington are now adopting a more cautious stance. This week, representatives for each senator declined to comment on whether they want the president to act before the elections or wait until after.\n\n\"The timing of it is entirely up to him,\" said Ben Marter, spokesman for Sen. Durbin, referring to the president's decision.\n\nDemocrats are attempting to divert attention back to the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has stated that there are no plans to act on immigration this year.\n\n\"If House Republicans would just do their job and pass an immigration reform bill that fixes a broken system, then we wouldn't even be having this conversation,\" said Adam Jentleson, spokesman for Sen. Reid, who declined to comment further.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Schumer echoed similar sentiments, stating, \"The president would not be forced to even contemplate taking independent action to cope with our broken system had House Republicans not spent more than a year blocking the Senate's already-passed bipartisan immigration reform legislation.\"\n\nThe debate underscores the delicate dance that Democrats are performing on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue regarding immigration. Obama and Democratic congressional leaders are grappling with calls to take action on immigration while avoiding steps that could jeopardize the Senate's Democratic majority.\n\nThe GOP is already capitalizing on the issue in key Senate races. Obama administration officials are reportedly preparing to ease deportations for certain undocumented immigrants living in the United States illegally, though the exact timing remains uncertain.\n\nIn a Univision interview this week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressed support for granting protections to parents of U.S. citizens or young undocumented immigrants, similar to the \"Dreamers\" shielded under a 2012 Obama administration directive. Pelosi also endorsed calls to protect the estimated 8 million undocumented immigrants who would have qualified under the Senate's comprehensive reform bill.\n\nWith the potential for backlash in conservative states, Democratic leaders in the Senate are reluctant to take ownership of the timing of the president's decision. At the same time, they do not want to alienate pro-immigration groups by publicly siding with red-state Democrats, despite the Senate leadership's efforts to shield their vulnerable members from taking tough votes all year.",
    " Title: Supporting Protesters and Advocating for Change: A Guide to Donating and Taking Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of ongoing protests against police brutality and systemic racism, many are seeking ways to support protesters and contribute to the cause. One immediate action is making a donation to a local bail fund to help secure the release of protesters who have been arrested.\n\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to reduce the risk of exposure for protesters in detention facilities. Donating to bail funds can help expedite their release, ensuring their safety and enabling them to continue their peaceful demonstrations.\n\nSeveral local bail funds have been established across the country to assist protesters. Due to an outpouring of support, some of these funds, such as the Minneapolis Freedom Fund and the Brooklyn Bail Fund, have asked donors to redirect their funds to other nonprofits. To find a list of funds for major cities, consider this thread compiled by filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry.\n\nWhen deciding where to send your donations, it's essential to conduct a background check on the organization to ensure your contribution is going to a legitimate and trustworthy cause. Another starting point is the National Bail Fund Network, which offers a directory of community bail funds, organized by state. Additionally, ActBlue's donation portal allows you to split your donation among 38 different community bail funds.\n\nIn the short-term, getting protesters out of jail quickly is critical. In the longer-term, police brutality is a systemic issue that requires comprehensive reform. If you have extra funds to spare, consider donating to organizations working on solutions for ending police brutality, such as Campaign Zero. Campaign Zero not only accepts donations but also serves as a valuable resource for understanding possible solutions and learning about actions you can take right now to address police violence.\n\nFor those looking for ways to advocate for black lives, there are numerous resources available.

The announcement was made on Tuesday, with Palin stating, \"I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America.\"\n\nAt a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, Palin expressed her support for Trump, stating, \"You\u2019re putting relationships on the line for this country because you\u2019re willing to make America great again.\" She further added, \"I am here because like you, I know it\u2019s now or never.\"\n\nTrump, in response, expressed his gratitude for Palin's support, stating, \"She\u2019s the woman that from day one I said I needed to get her support.\"\n\nPalin, who is known for her association with the Tea Party movement, is the highest-profile backer for a Republican contender in the race so far. In her endorsement speech, she praised Trump for bringing up controversial issues to create \"a good, heated primary,\" while taking aim at what she called \"establishment candidates\" in the race.\n\nThe endorsement comes less than two weeks before the critical lead-off Iowa caucus, where Trump is currently in a dead heat with Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In the statement announcing the endorsement, Trump's campaign described Palin as a conservative who \"helped launch the careers of several key future leaders of the Republican Party and conservative movement.\"\n\nSenator Cruz responded to Palin's endorsement of Trump, stating, \"Regardless of what Sarah intends to do in 2016, I will remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin.\"\n\nPalin is expected to join Trump for campaign events in Norwalk, Iowa, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Wednesday. The Democratic National Committee responded to the endorsement, stating, \"Even with a record number of candidates and internal calls to become more inclusive as a party, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin remain two of the GOP\u2019s most influential leaders.\"\n\nIn addition to Palin's endorsement, Trump received another endorsement on Tuesday from Aissa Wayne, the daughter of the western film actor John Wayne. Wayne endorsed Trump, stating that the country needs a strong and courageous leader like her father, and that he would have endorsed Trump if he were still alive.\n\nThe endorsements come as the Republican primary race heats up, with a record number of candidates vying for the party's nomination.

    " Title: The Myth of Technological Unemployment: A Closer Look at the Impact of Automation on the American Workforce\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate about the effects of technological advancements on the American workforce, a common concern is the potential for technological unemployment. This fear is fueled by the notion that as automation and other technological innovations replace human labor, a significant portion of the workforce will be left jobless. However, a closer examination of historical and contemporary data suggests that this fear may be unfounded.\n\nThe argument for technological unemployment is often supported by references to the works of economists such as Robert Gordon, Tyler Cowen, John Maynard Keynes, and David Ricardo, who have expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs due to technology. Yet, the results of automation have generally been positive overall. Workers have moved from menial jobs to better ones, monitoring robots in high-tech environments, or have found employment in industries that benefit from the cheaper goods produced by robots.\n\nOne common misconception is that the employees of car companies make up a significant portion of the car-buying public. This is a fallacy, as the majority of car buyers are not employees of the companies they purchase from. The idea that creating prosperity is achieved by having workers purchase from their own employers is flawed.\n\nHistorically, the advent of mechanical harvesting, hybrid corn, and other technological innovations have not led to widespread unemployment. In 1800, four out of five Americans worked on farms, but today, only one in 50 do. Similarly, the decline in jobs in sectors such as railways, manual telephone operators, elevator operators, typists, and even video store clerks has not resulted in the high levels of unemployment one might expect.\n\nIn the United States, approximately 1.7 million jobs disappear each month, a natural manifestation of creative destruction. This equates to over 1% of jobs lost per month, or more than 10% per year at simple interest. If disemployment were truly permanent, a third of the labor force would be unemployed within a few years, and the fraction would continue to rise. However, this is not the case.\n\nThe solution to technological unemployment is not to halt innovation, as this would perpetuate the same income levels for those currently doing well, while leaving the poor and young with few opportunities. Instead, we should focus on creating a flexible labor force that can adapt to changing economic conditions. This requires liberty, not government programs that may subsidize jobs or attempt to dictate job retraining from above.\n\nUltimately, the question we should ask is which society we would rather enter at birth, without knowing where within that society we would end up. One in which all jobs are protected, bureaucrats decide who gets subsidies and who doesn't, and the economy stagnates, as seen in France, or one in which labor laws are flexible, individual workers decide their own futures, and the economy lifts up the poorest among us? The latter seems to be the more desirable option.",
    " Title: Presidential Interference in Military Justice: The Bergdahl Case and the Question of Mitigation\n\nArticle:\n\nA controversial ruling in the court-martial of Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant who deserted his post in Afghanistan, has sparked outrage and concern among military and legal experts. The case has been marred by allegations of presidential interference, with President Donald Trump's public comments on the case potentially influencing the outcome of the trial.\n\nCandidate Trump had previously expressed harsh criticism of Bergdahl, calling him a \"dirty rotten traitor\" and suggesting he should be executed. These comments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, raised concerns about inappropriate command influence on military proceedings. However, Trump was not a commander at the time, and his comments did not directly affect the case.\n\nAfter Bergdahl pled guilty, Trump was questioned about his pre-election tweets, and he responded by stating that \"People heard what I said.\" This renewed his previous efforts at interference, and critics argued that Trump's comments as president put unlawful pressure on the military and its court-martial system.\n\nThe presiding judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, announced that he had not been influenced by Trump's public outbursts. However, during a hearing at Fort Bragg, Col. Nance stated that he would consider the president's comments as mitigation evidence in determining an appropriate sentence for Bergdahl.\n\nThis decision has been widely criticized as illogical and a travesty of justice. The president's comments do not provide any factual, legal, or moral justification for a lenient sentence for Bergdahl. In fact, they may have tainted the prosecution by undue influence.\n\nThe concern is that Col. Nance's decision to consider the president's comments as mitigation evidence was a violation of the principles of justice and the rule of law. Federal rules of evidence allow the exclusion of evidence that may be more prejudicial than relevant or probative. In this case, the president's comments were external noise that should have no bearing on the proceeding or Nance's judgment.\n\nCritics argue that Col. Nance's decision to consider the president's comments as mitigation evidence was a defiant gesture aimed at President Trump, but it was much more than that. The ruling fully spoke to the men and women who serve and sacrifice, their families, and millions of informed Americans who bear witness.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage and concern among military and legal experts, who argue that the president's comments should not have been considered as mitigation evidence. The ruling has been criticized as a travesty of justice, and calls for a review of the case and a possible retrial have been made.\n\nMay God please comfort the families and rest the souls of the men who died searching to find and rescue the deserter. And may Karma please visit Barack Obama and Susan Rice in their thoughts and dreams and torment them for the lies they knowingly told the nation about former Private Bergdahl.",
    " Title: Investigators Focus on Engineer's Actions in Amtrak Derailment as Inquiry Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that left eight people dead and over 200 injured, investigators are zeroing in on the actions of the train's engineer, Brandon Bostian, in the crucial moments leading up to the crash.\n\nInvestigators have reviewed a video shot from the front of the train until the moment it left the track. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt revealed that with 65 seconds remaining on the video, the train's speed was 70 m.p.h. With 16 seconds left, the speed had reached 100 m.p.h., eventually accelerating to 106 m.p.h. before the engineer applied the emergency brakes, causing a slight deceleration.\n\n\"Mere seconds into the turn, we see the train tilting approximately 10 degrees to the right,\" Mr. Sumwalt told reporters at a press conference in Philadelphia. \"And then the screen went blank.\"\n\nThe train's engine, an ACS64, had been in service for less than a year and had no reported issues, according to Mr. Sumwalt. The track, checked by the railroad the day before the accident, and the signals, all of which have been inspected since, showed no problems. The only exceptions are those in the immediate vicinity of the wreckage that have yet to be tested.\n\nAlthough railroads like Amtrak still heavily rely on infrastructure from decades past, the locomotive involved was a modern marvel \u2013 a \"Cities Sprinter\" electric locomotive that was introduced only last year, with design roots in Germany and Austria. The locomotive was built by Siemens and delivered to Amtrak in 2014 specifically for its Northeast Corridor service.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the focus remains on understanding the sequence of events that led to the tragic accident and ensuring the safety of passengers traveling by rail.",
    " Title: The Real Reasons Behind Democratic Opposition to Betsy DeVos' Education Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, Vice President Mike Pence was compelled to cast the deciding vote for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, following weeks of intense opposition from the Democratic party. The question remains, why did Democrats engage in an all-out war against an education secretary rather than focusing their efforts on other cabinet nominees?\n\nSome Democrats and mainstream media outlets have based their opposition on claims of \"radical\" views, citing Secretary DeVos' alleged pro-charter school stance as a point of contention. However, as New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has noted, Secretary DeVos' views are not significantly different from the Obama administration's pro-charter schools position and are almost identical to the perspectives of centrist Democrats such as Senator Cory Booker.\n\nOther Democrats and media outlets have opposed Mrs. DeVos due to her lack of experience as a government bureaucrat or school administrator, as well as her inability to answer certain questions during the confirmation hearings. However, these reasons may not fully explain the fever-pitch opposition.\n\nAs opinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have argued, the overheated Democratic opposition is motivated by:\n\n1. The influence of powerful interest groups, such as teachers' unions, who recognize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education under DeVos' tenure.\n2. The Democratic Party's upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency, who understand that DeVos' charters and vouchers will be attractive to families with financial disadvantages, ethnic minority heritage, or ideological and religious convictions that differ from the mainstream. In other words, private schooling will be accessible to children who are very different than the Democratic Party's upper-middle-class suburbanites.\n\nIn response to the Democratic Party's powerful interest groups and upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency, here are four reasons why DeVos may turn out to be a welcome remedy to our nation's educational ills:\n\n1. Liberation from Bureaucracy: DeVos' educational philosophy could enable her to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.\n2. Empowering Families and Communities: DeVos' educational philosophy would allow financially-disadvantaged children to choose the education that fits their unique needs and abilities. In the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government\u2014rather than the family or local community\u2014is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.\nUnder DeVos' potential system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child's education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.\n3. Qualifications and Experience: DeVos' critics argued that she wasn't qualified to serve as our new Secretary of Education because she had not served as a teacher, a principal, or an educational policy wonk. However, those experiences are not necessary prerequisites for the office. As Michael Petrilli noted, Secretary DeVos has devoted her life energies and financial resources to the cause of education and has interacted extensively with politicians and educational policy makers. Although her path to the post of secretary is different than her predecessors, it is a good path, and one that qualifies her.\n4. A Philanthropist at Heart: We already know that DeVos will be an imperfect Secretary of Education\u2014just as all prior secretaries of education have been. Yet, there are good reasons to believe that she will be successful. She is a philanthropist who has proven that she cares deeply about education. She holds a philosophy of education that can reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged. And, she has the work ethic and the connections to make it happen.\n\nSo let's just step back for a moment, cool our fevered brows, and pull for Betsy DeVos as she tries to reform our nation's education system.",
    " Title: President Trump Continues to Use \"Chinese Virus\" Term, Sparks Controversy and Concerns Over Racial Sensitivity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and remarks during a press conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump once again referred to the novel coronavirus as the \"Chinese Virus,\" despite calls from global health officials to avoid labels associating the disease with a particular nation or ethnic group.\n\nThe president's comments have drawn backlash and raised concerns about stigmatizing Asian-Americans, with critics arguing that his rhetoric could fuel discrimination and hate crimes against them.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump used the phrase in a tweet about supporting the airline industry as travel restrictions decimate their business. \"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!\" he wrote.\n\nScientists say the virus originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, but the World Health Organization has warned against using terms that associate diseases with certain groups of people.\n\nDespite this, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as \"Chinese virus\" on Twitter Wednesday morning and later at a White House press conference. Asked by a reporter why he continues to use a phrase that some consider to be racist, the president defended his terminology.\n\n\"Because it comes from China,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's not racist at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate.\"\n\nThe White House also noted that similar names for illnesses have been used in the past, citing examples such as Spanish Flu, West Nile Virus, Zika, and Ebola, all named for places.\n\nOn social media, many critics condemned the president's use of the term. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Tuesday, \"Our Asian-American communities \u2014 people YOU serve \u2014 are already suffering. They do not need you fueling more bigotry.\" The NYPD is investigating several cases of potential hate crime attacks on Asian-Americans in recent days, and Asian-Americans across the country have reported experiencing heightened discrimination, bullying, and harassment.\n\nDr. Eugene Gu responded on Twitter, \"I've been deathly afraid of this exact moment where Trump turns to racism and xenophobia and calls COVID-19 the 'Chinese Virus.' We are in deep trouble as a nation now that the President of the United States makes the conscious decision to go down this dark path of hate.\"\n\nEvangelical pastor Eugene Cho called for the president to set an example of unity instead of finger-pointing. \"Mr. President: This is not acceptable. Calling it the 'Chinese virus' only instigates blame, racism, and hatred against Asians \u2014 here and abroad. We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism; Leadership that brings the nation and world together. Not further divides.\"\n\nHowever, at least one TV personality came out in support of Mr. Trump's remark Tuesday night. Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson praised the president, saying, \"How is it inaccurate to call a virus from China 'Chinese?'\"\n\n\"Good for him,\" Carlson said. \"That was Trump at his very best.\"\n\nThe president has used such rhetoric before. In his Oval Office address last week, Mr. Trump made a point of referring to it as a \"foreign virus\" that \"started in China.\" At a congressional hearing on March 10, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, agreed when asked by Congresswoman Lois Frankel that it was \"absolutely wrong and inappropriate\" to call COVID-19 the \"Chinese coronavirus.\"\n\n\"This painful rhetoric has consequences,\" Democratic Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said at another hearing on March 12, calling out an unnamed Republican colleague who'd also referred to it as the \"Chinese coronavirus.\" \"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen not only the spreading of the virus but also a rapid spreading of racism and xenophobia.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Affirms Belief in U.S. Intelligence Agencies' Assessment on Russian Election Interference, Yet Expresses Trust in Putin's Denials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a news conference in Hanoi, President Donald Trump clarified on Sunday that he accepts the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, but also expressed belief in Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials of such interference.\n\n\"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin. \"As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies. As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump had criticized the former heads of the FBI, the CIA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, labeling them as \"hacks\" and questioning their judgment on the matter of Russian meddling. The president, who now has new leadership in all three agencies, said on Sunday that he has worked \"very strongly\" with the new leadership in U.S. intelligence.\n\nThe CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. A special counsel's examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides has led to indictments against Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Trump foreign policy adviser.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ) said in a statement that Mr. Trump's belief in Mr. Putin's denial was \"naive.\"\n\n\"There's nothing 'America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community,\" Mr. McCain said. \"Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, the president bashed the \"haters and fools\" he said were questioning his efforts to improve relations with Russia, and accused critics of \"playing politics\" and hurting the U.S.\n\nReferring to his earlier comments about Mr. Putin's denials, Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday, \"What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. What he believes is what he believes. What I believe is that we have to get to work.\"\n\nHe said again that the U.S. needs Russia's help on issues ranging from North Korea to Syria.\n\n\"We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve North Korea, to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism,\" the president said.\n\nHe also pointed to recent U.S. sanctions against Moscow over the election meddling.\n\n\"People don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned,\" he said. \"They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.\"\n\nMr. Trump commented on the Russia election issue for the second straight day on Sunday, just before he arrived in the Philippines, the final stop on a five-country trip to Asia. In Manila, Mr. Trump is meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and will attend a pair of international summits.",
    " Title: Arizona Primary: Clinton's Arizona Victory Casts Doubt on Sanders' Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders' anticipated Arizona victory, initially slated for next week, now appears uncertain following his recent losses in several states. The Vermont senator has been questioning his ability to recover from his poor performance in time for the March 22 contest against Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I think he needed a lot of momentum heading into the last week of voting here,\" said D.J. Quinlan, an unaligned Arizona Democratic strategist and former executive director of the state Democratic Party. \"Hillary's sweep definitely took away any momentum they had.\"\n\nSanders faced a challenging situation in Arizona even before the recent losses. In 2008, Clinton won 13 of the state's 15 counties against Barack Obama, and the state's significant Hispanic population has historically favored Clinton. The misstep during his wife Jane Sanders' visit to conservative Sheriff Joe Arpaio's \"Tent City\" outdoor jail, which was met with criticism from immigration rights advocates, further complicated matters.\n\nThe Clinton campaign swiftly capitalized on the situation, with Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez, a leading immigration rights advocate, stating, \"When Jane Sanders visited Joe Arpaio's inhumane detention center, the Sanders campaign had a chance to tell Arpaio to his face that he was wrong and that he needed to resign -- as many of us have said for years.\"\n\nIn response, the Clinton campaign released a series of ads highlighting Clinton's work on immigration reform and contrasting her record with real estate mogul Donald Trump and Arpaio, who has endorsed Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sanders campaign has been active in its Latino outreach efforts. Sanders has secured endorsements from more than a dozen prominent Latino Democrats in the state and released ads featuring Tucson-based Congressman Raul Grijalva, a leading progressive who represents much of southern Arizona.\n\nThe pattern in Democratic primaries and caucuses so far is that Sanders has had the advantage among younger voters and less diverse electorates, while Clinton has had the upper hand in more diverse electorates and among older voters. Arizona, being closer to the latter, presents a challenge for Sanders.\n\n\"She's doing very well with whites over 50, which is most whites,\" Quinlan said, pointing to this as a positive sign for Clinton. \"Frankly, I just think Hillary's organization is stronger, and the fact is I just think she has a built-in demographic advantage.\"\n\nSanders isn't just fighting demographics in Arizona \u2013 he's also fighting against a well-known candidate in the state. \"The Clintons have been very popular in Arizona. President Bill Clinton has visited on multiple occasions to campaign on behalf of Democrats over the last two, four cycles,\" said Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman Alexis Tameron. \"So there's a familial essence to that. And I also do think it's a belief amongst political types that Latinos are drawn to the Clintons, like Latinos are drawn to the Kennedys.\"\n\nClinton, who currently leads by 26 percentage points in the only recent polling, has yet to campaign in the state, while Sanders has made stops three times and his campaign has attracted large crowds. Early voting, which starts about two weeks before the primary election, may offer some insight into the eventual outcome.\n\nEarly voting numbers have provided some positive signs for Clinton: According to figures provided by the Arizona Democratic Party, of the 601,049 early ballot requests, 262,547 were returned, with 121,374 from voters 65 and over and another 75,504 from voters between the ages 50-64. Both age groups have been friendly to Clinton in other states.\n\nBy contrast, just 18,842 ballots have been returned from voters between the ages of 25 to 34 and 8,959 from voters between 18 and 24 \u2013 ominous signs for Sanders, who runs best among younger voters.\n\nSanders' chief strategist Tad Devine acknowledged the challenges facing the campaign in Arizona but remained optimistic that Sanders might pull out a victory. \"I think Hillary's ahead. I concede that. I think she had a bump out of Tuesday there as well,\" Devine said. \"There's a lot of early vote, and she tends to be very much ahead with the early vote. I think about half the people have already voted in Arizona. So I think she has an advantage. But I think we're closing hard.\"",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Debate Highlights the Rivalry Between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final Republican presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses, the growing feud between Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida took center stage. Both senators, who represent different ideological wings of the Republican Party, engaged in a heated exchange on national security and immigration, with the latter two issues being the dominant themes of the evening following the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.\n\nThe debate, held in Las Vegas, saw the two Cuban-American senators, both in their mid-40s, go after each other on the issues of NSA phone record surveillance, defense spending, and Islamic State, as well as their respective stances on immigration.\n\nOn the issue of NSA phone record surveillance, Rubio has been critical of Cruz's vote for the USA Freedom Act, which imposed new limits on the collection of phone metadata by US intelligence agencies. Rubio argued that the lack of access to records and information could have prevented terror attacks, while Cruz defended the legislation as expanding the potential universe of records the government has access to.\n\nIn terms of defense spending and approach to Islamic State, Rubio accused Cruz of voting against legislation that authorizes defense spending, stating that air forces alone cannot defeat ISIS. Cruz, on the other hand, has promised to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS with air strikes and is less enamored of sending US ground troops to Syria and Iraq.\n\nCruz also tried to distance himself from Rubio by painting him as aligned with the policies of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Cruz argued that the focus should be on killing the bad guys, not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars.\n\nImmigration was another contentious issue, with Rubio's stance being the most fraught for some conservatives due to his co-authorship of comprehensive immigration reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Rubio has sought to differentiate himself from Cruz by highlighting his support for big increases in the caps on green cards and the number of visas for high-tech workers. Cruz, in response, has since backed off that position and fought back, stating that he led the fight against Rubio's \"legalization and amnesty.\"\n\nIn post-debate analysis, both senators were deemed to have had strong performances, and their duel is likely to intensify in the weeks ahead. The fact that both Cruz and Rubio are Cuban-American first-term senators may be an accident of history, but it matters to a Republican Party anxious to showcase diversity. Whether either candidate can make major inroads into the Hispanic vote is an open question, particularly for Cruz, who does not speak Spanish and who only uses his heritage to highlight his Cuban-born father's journey to freedom in the US.\n\nRubio, on the other hand, is fluent in Spanish and has made his Cuban-immigrant parents' humble lives as service-workers a central part of his optimistic view of the American dream. If any of the Republican candidates are capable of channeling Ronald Reagan, whose sunny demeanor helped him to the presidency twice, it may be Rubio. Likability is a key ingredient to presidential campaign success, and if support for Trump begins to wane, one can't assume that his voters will go to Cruz.\n\n\"Too often [Cruz's] message seems negative, and I think that's a challenge for him,\" says Henry Barbour, Republican national committeeman from Mississippi, speaking before Tuesday's debate. \"The key is to come across as the guy with the positive agenda \u2013 the Ronald Reagan of the group. And everybody wants to be the Ronald Reagan.\"",
    " Title: Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro: A Shift Away from Leftism and Towards Nationalism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of Brazil, a significant shift has occurred with the election of Jair Bolsonaro, who has been dubbed the \"Trump of the tropics.\" The media has compared his victory to a return of \"fascists\" on a platform of \"beef, bibles, and bullets.\" However, Brazilians, tired of years of failed leftist policies, seem unperturbed, according to the UK Spectator.\n\nAn anecdote from the Spectator highlights this sentiment: when Pink Floyd's Roger Waters gave a concert in S\u00e3o Paulo and broadcast an anti-Bolsonaro message, he was booed for a quarter of an hour. The wealthy audience, who could afford tickets for his show, were reportedly Bolsonaro voters. Brazilians feel that only they can understand the peculiar afflictions of their country, and there is irritation that others should impose their opinions.\n\nRecent developments in Brazil have been promising, with Bolsonaro canceling a climate change summit for next year in Rio, viewing it as costly and a waste of time. He has also appointed Ernesto Araujo, his choice for foreign minister, who rejects the pro-abortion stance of the international community and dismisses environmental activism as Marxism.\n\nThe left-leaning media has expressed concern over Araujo's appointment, with headlines such as \"Brazil's Bolsonaro names Trump fan top diplomat as Cuba relations sour.\" The media has also criticized Araujo for his views on the environment, labeling him as \"anti-Christian\" and a useful idiot for anti-Western countries.\n\nBolsonaro's stance on the Paris climate accord has also caused controversy, with France going up in flames due to his environmental policies, and President Macron threatening to retaliate against Brazil if it pulls out of the accord. However, Bolsonaro remains firm, stating that he will not risk the country's agribusiness for the sake of bowing to green novelties and alarmist conjecture.\n\nAraujo's article urging Trumpian \"Brazil First\" policies has been met with disapproval by the media, but to many Brazilians, it sounds like long-overdue common sense. As they look across the border to a country like Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez deprived the people of all three elements of \"beef, bibles, and bullets,\" the shift in policy seems like a step towards stability and self-reliance.",
    " Title: Esquire's Cover Story Sparks Controversy During Black History Month\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Esquire magazine has found itself at the center of a social media storm after debuting a cover story on Tuesday that features a white, middle-class teen during Black History Month. The March issue of the men's glossy magazine presents a lengthy profile about 17-year-old Ryan Morgan, a high school senior from West Bend, Wisconsin, under the headline \"An American Boy.\"\n\nThe cover choice has been widely criticized on Twitter as tone-deaf, with many users expressing their disapproval. One user, @seanieviola, tweeted, \"Inside Esquire conference room: 'We should probably do a cover story for Black History Month, any suggestions?' 'There's a white boy in Wisconsin who's sad.' Esquire CEO: 'Run it.'\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Christine Pelosi, also voiced her disapproval, writing, \"Esquire: 'Let's use a white teen boy as our foil to lament the rising power of #MeToo and of gun violence prevention advocacy in a cover photo above an inside look at Harvey Weinstein's rape defense for #BlackHistoryMonth.' - @esquire making a series of bad choices.\"\n\nA follower replied, \"Esquire: 'Have you dry heaved this morning? Let us help you.'\"\n\nThe Esquire piece about Morgan delves into his daily life and the adversity he's faced for being a supporter of President Trump. \"I couldn't say anything without pissing someone off... Lots of drama over politics,\" he told the magazine. \"It ruined friendships and changed social groups. People were making friends based on their politics more than anything.\"\n\nIn a separate story titled \"Why Your Ideological Echo Chamber Isn't Just Bad For You,\" Esquire editor-in-chief Jay Fielden explained that Morgan's cover story is part of a series on growing up now, exploring different perspectives, including white, black, LGBTQ, and female, which will continue to appear in coming issues.\n\n\"What we asked [author Jennifer Percy] to do\u2014and she did brilliantly\u2014was to look at our divided country through the eyes of one kid,\" Fielden said. \"Ryan Morgan is his name. He's white, lives in the middle of the reddest county in Wisconsin, and, as you will see, he is an unusually mature, intelligent, and determined young man.\"\n\nThe Esquire cover story and the ensuing controversy serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges of navigating diverse perspectives in today's society and the potential consequences of insensitive decisions in media representation.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on China over Uighur Repression, China Threatens Countermeasures\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing human rights concerns, U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday that mandates sanctions against those responsible for the repression of China's Uighur minority. The bill, which passed with a single \"no\" vote in Congress, is intended to send a strong message to China and hold accountable those involved in the alleged mistreatment of over a million Muslims in the Xinjiang region.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Muslims to torture, abuse, and attempting to erase their culture and religion. China, however, denies the mistreatment and claims the camps provide vocational training and are necessary to combat extremism.\n\nIn response to the signing of the law, China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement, expressing anger and accusing the U.S. of \"vilifying\" the human rights situation in Xinjiang and launching a malicious attack against China. China threatened countermeasures, without providing details, and urged the U.S. to correct its mistakes and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.\n\nThe U.S. and China are already at odds over various issues, including China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan. The World Uyghur Congress, a main exile group, thanked Trump for signing the law, stating that it gave hope to the desperate Uighur people.\n\nTrump signed the bill as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held his first face-to-face meeting since last year with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi. Trump issued a signing statement, noting that some of the bill's requirements might limit his constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy, regarding them as advisory, not mandatory.\n\nThe signing came as newspapers published excerpts from the new book by former national security adviser John Bolton. Among other allegations, Bolton claims that Trump sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election during a closed-door 2019 meeting, and that Trump approved of the construction of the camps in Xinjiang.\n\nThe Uighur law for the first time calls for sanctions on a member of China's powerful Politburo, Xinjiang's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, as responsible for \"gross human rights violations.\" It also calls on U.S. companies operating in Xinjiang to take steps to ensure they do not use parts made with forced labor. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison, presented a 19-page blueprint that focuses on deficit reduction through tax increases and investments in infrastructure, education, and public welfare programs.\n\nThe budget plans, in essence, offer a choice between two alternate futures for America.\n\nAccording to Paul Ryan's vision, the government achieves fiscal sustainability by implementing tax reform, lowering rates for individuals and corporations while eliminating deductions and credits. Medicare is transformed into a voucher system for those turning 55, with the program surviving through cost-containment measures. The Affordable Care Act is repealed, and tort reform is enacted to reduce frivolous lawsuits. Welfare is provided only to those meeting work requirements, and job-training programs and career scholarships help people find employment.\n\nIn contrast, the House Progressive Caucus's budget calls for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for those earning over $250,000, with increased tax rates for millionaires and billionaires. The federal government invests more in infrastructure, creating jobs, and extends unemployment benefits to nearly two years. A public-option health system is adopted, while Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security benefits remain intact. The caucus also proposes a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and rollbacks of corporate tax credits benefiting oil and gas production.\n\nBoth budgets promise significant deficit reduction, but the progressive budget aims for $4.4 trillion in savings through tax increases and ending the war in Afghanistan, while maintaining and expanding government services. The Ryan budget, on the other hand, aims for a $1.2 trillion reduction, balancing the budget in 10 years and saving basic services from bankruptcy.\n\nWhile both budgets may not come to fruition in their entirety, they serve as a testament to the deep partisan divide in the House and the challenges in finding common ground between fiscal conservatives and liberal spending advocates. The next 10 years will likely see a compromise between the two, as Republicans and Democrats seek a middle ground that balances fiscal responsibility with investment in vital services.",
    " Title: Democrats Adopt GOP Tactics in 2014 Campaign Strategy Amid Challenging Political Climate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats running in traditionally blue or purple districts are adopting Republican-leaning campaign strategies, reflecting a shift in response to a challenging political environment.\n\nFaced with President Barack Obama's rising unpopularity and the tendency for conservatives to turn out in higher numbers during midterm years, Democrats are emphasizing balanced budgets, tax cuts, and other traditionally GOP positions in their campaign ads. This strategy is a departure from the more liberal positions they may have taken in previous elections.\n\nIn districts that voted heavily for Obama in 2012 and 2008, such as Colorado's 6th district, Democratic candidate Andrew Romanoff is running an ad that mirrors a tea party theme, highlighting his record in balancing the state's budget. New Hampshire's 2nd district representative, Ann McLane Kuster, is promoting her support for small-business tax cuts and touring local businesses in her ad. Former Iowa state senator Staci Appel, who represents a district Obama won by 4 percentage points two years ago, is emphasizing her record of fighting overspending in state government.\n\nIn a swing southern Arizona district, Democratic representative Ron Barber is focusing on increasing border security funds, a theme that does not mention elements of immigration reform typically popular among Democratic voters. Colorado's 6th district candidate, Patrick Henry Hays, who is running in an Arkansas district that Mitt Romney won in 2012, is emphasizing the need for a balanced budget, limited government regulations, and less wasteful spending.\n\nThese candidates are not overtly mentioning their Democratic Party affiliation in their ads, a strategy aimed at appealing to more conservative voters in competitive districts. The success of these Democrats in the 2014 midterms will largely depend on their ability to strike a moderate tone and connect with conservative voters.\n\n\"It's a different kind of electorate,\" said Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco-based Democratic pollster. \"If you're running in a competitive district as a Democrat in a nonpresidential year, you want to strike a more moderate tone.\"",
    " Title: Obama Clarifies Economic Remark, Acknowledges Weak Economy Amidst Political Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama found himself in a whirlwind of controversy on Friday, as his comment during a press conference that \"the private sector is doing fine\" became a focal point for criticism from Mitt Romney and congressional Republicans.\n\nObama's initial statement, intended to highlight private-sector job growth, was quickly seized upon as evidence of his alleged disconnect from the state of the economy. Within hours, the President backtracked, acknowledging that \"it is absolutely clear the economy is not doing fine.\"\n\nThe President's original statement contradicted the consensus of economists who view the current recovery as the weakest in modern American history. The comment also reinforced the central Mitt Romney campaign talking point that Obama is a European-style socialist out of touch with the free enterprise system.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney seized the opportunity to criticize Obama, stating, \"For the President of the United States to stand up and say the private sector is doing fine is going to go down in history as an extraordinary miscalculation and misunderstanding by a president who\u2019s out of touch.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Speaker John Boehner, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also joined in the criticism, labeling the President's statement as disconnected from reality.\n\nIn the afternoon, Obama addressed the controversy, decrying the \"political games\" that had amplified his morning comments. He reiterated his awareness of the economy's weakness, stating, \"The economy is not doing fine. There are too many people out of work. The housing market is still weak, too many homes underwater and that\u2019s precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that can make a difference.\"\n\nThe President's press conference was initially intended to offer assurances that he was working to address Europe's economic troubles while pushing for growth at home. He also used the opportunity to denounce rumors of leaks of key national security information as \"offensive.\"",
    " Title: The Biblical Rhythms and Literary Influences in Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech delivered at the 1963 March on Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Baptist ministers, skillfully blended the oral tradition of the black church with biblical rhythms, historical allusions, and literary references. This synthesis of various ideas and motifs not only resonated with his audience but also added depth and amplification to his message.\n\nDr. King's speech, replete with biblical allusions, drew parallels between the African-American struggle for equality and the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. He referenced passages from the Bible, such as the prophets Isaiah and Amos, the Declaration of Independence, Shakespeare, and popular songs like Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nOne of the most famous biblical allusions in the speech is when Dr. King speaks of \"that day when all of God's children\u2014black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics\u2014will be able to join hands.\" This allusion is a nod to a passage from Galatians, emphasizing unity and equality among all people.\n\nAnother significant biblical reference is the dream sequence, which is interwoven with the \"Exodus\" narrative. Dr. King's dream for America is a call for deliverance from hardship and oppression, mirroring the Israelites' journey towards freedom.\n\nThe speech's literary influences extend beyond the Bible, with references to works by T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, and W.E.B. Du Bois. These references lend a historical continuity to Dr. King's message, grounding it in the dreams and aspirations of those who came before him.\n\nDr. King's ability to synthesize ideas and make them accessible to diverse audiences was a testament to his gift for oratory. This gift, combined with his leadership skills, allowed him to balance the concerns of grass-roots activists with the need to forge a working alliance with the federal government, ultimately shaping the trajectory of the civil rights movement.\n\nIn his final lines, Dr. King quoted a Negro spiritual, reminding his audience of the slaves' sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation: \"Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\" This poignant conclusion encapsulates the hope and determination that defined Dr. King's leadership and the civil rights movement as a whole.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Work Around the Clock to Avert Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for government funding approaches, Congress is working tirelessly to finalize a $1.3 trillion spending bill and avoid a government shutdown. House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed optimism that negotiators will reach an agreement by Tuesday, and stated that a continuing resolution is not currently being considered as a backup plan.\n\n\"There are some unresolved issues. We're working through them as we speak, and we're hoping to post it today,\" Ryan (R-Wis.) said.\n\nAppropriators have been working nearly around the clock to complete the spending bill, with one top GOP aide reporting that they worked past 1 a.m. on Tuesday before taking a break and resuming at 7:30 a.m. The agreement requires bipartisan support from the White House and all four corners of Congress, including Senate and House Democrats as well as Senate and House Republicans.\n\nA top Democratic aide noted that there are still around 20 riders in play and at least a dozen other major issues being discussed during the negotiations. \"This process just takes time,\" the aide added.\n\nRepublicans appear ready to attach the Fix NICS gun purchase background checks bill to the spending package, a move that could help build bipartisan consensus around the package. \"That's something we're discussing with our colleagues. I think we should do Fix NICS. I agree with Fix NICS. That's something we're discussing with our friends on the other side of the aisle,\" Ryan said.\n\nRep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) is hoping to attach the Gateway Tunnel project to the spending bill, a move that could potentially gain President Trump's support and fund the project. \"This is important. It's important to the nation. It'd be an economic stimulus,\" Donovan said.\n\nHowever, not all Republicans are on board with the spending bill. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a member of the Freedom Caucus, has announced that he will vote no due to the $1.3 trillion price tag. \"I'm not happy with the product that's going to be there in four days, but we can get there. That's the problem is we're going to get there,\" Brat said.\n\nWith government funding set to lapse at the end of the day on Friday, time is running out for Congress to reach an agreement and avoid a shutdown. \"We have to keep our government open. Nobody sent us to Washington to shut their government down. They sent us to make it work better for them,\" Donovan said.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Admits to Misleading Investigators About Media Leak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has admitted to misleading investigators about his role in a media leak, according to transcripts of his interviews with investigators released Thursday by the Justice Department's inspector general in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThe transcripts detail the frustration of an unidentified FBI investigator who spent time investigating the leak, only to discover that the former deputy director himself was the source of the leak. McCabe had repeatedly denied being the source of the leak, but later confessed and apologized when confronted by the investigator, according to the transcripts.\n\nAn FBI agent recounted the conversation, stating, \"I remember saying to him, 'Sir, you understand that we've put a lot of work into this based on what you told us.'\" The agent further explained, \"I mean, and I even said, long nights and weekends working on this trying to find out who amongst your ranks of trusted people would, would do something like that. And [McCabe] kind of just looked down, kind of nodded and said, 'Yeah, I'm sorry.'\"\n\nInspector General Michael E. Horowitz concluded last year that McCabe \"lacked candor\" with investigators probing a leak to The Wall Street Journal that revealed the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton's emails and the Clinton Foundation. The Justice Department fired McCabe in the spring of 2018, citing Horowitz's conclusions. McCabe is suing the Justice Department for wrongful termination, alleging President Trump ordered his firing.\n\nWhen FBI investigators confronted McCabe about the leak, he denied authorizing the disclosure to The Wall Street Journal. He also presented himself as a \"victim,\" according to the agent who conducted the interview. After investigators received \"conflicting information\" on whether he ordered the leak, McCabe confessed in a follow-up interview, the transcripts said.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney in D.C. is currently considering criminal charges against McCabe based on Horowitz's conclusions. His attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. McCabe has stated he would refuse to accept a plea deal. The full extent of the investigation and any potential charges remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Sends Oregon Bakery Discrimination Case Back to Lower Court for Reconsideration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has sent back to a lower court a case involving an Oregon bakery whose owners claim the state drove them out of business after they refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple based on their religious beliefs. The top court's order on Monday scrapped a ruling from the Oregon Court of Appeals in favor of the same-sex couple.\n\nThe bakery's owners, who refused to make the cake, argued that state fines pushed them out of business. The Supreme Court asked the appeals court to reconsider the case in light of a top court holding from last year, the Masterpiece Cakeshop case. In that case, the court ruled 7-2 in favor of a baker who refused to serve a same-sex couple, stating that the state of Colorado was impermissibly hostile to the baker's religious beliefs.\n\nThe court in the Masterpiece case did not decide on the underlying question of whether a wedding cake qualifies as the type of artistic expression that is entitled to the Constitution's most stringent protections under the First Amendment. By sending the case back to the lower court, the justices handed an incremental win to the owners of the bakery while avoiding hearing the divisive case in the midst of the 2020 election campaign.\n\nThe court's term beginning in October is already expected to be significant for LGBT rights. In April, the court agreed to hear a set of cases that could settle whether federal antidiscrimination laws apply to LGBT employees. An opinion in the case is expected by June 2020, just months before Americans go to the polls in the next presidential election.\n\nThe court has now effectively punted twice in two years on the issue of whether a bakery may refuse service to a same-sex couple. In the Masterpiece case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has since retired and has been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, emphasized the difficulty of deciding the issue. He wrote that a baker's religious rights \"might\" be violated by antidiscrimination laws, but noted the difficulty of pinpointing the moment when a customer's right to not be discriminated against could give way to the business owner's own First Amendment rights.\n\n\"A baker's refusal to attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way, or a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the cake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the public generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on it are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but endless,\" Kennedy wrote. Ultimately, Kennedy predicted the issue would be addressed in \"some future controversy involving facts similar to these.\"",
    " Title: Shale Gas Revolution: A Double-Edged Sword for Climate Change and Energy Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shift from coal to shale gas as a primary source of electricity has been hailed as a significant step towards reducing carbon emissions, as shale gas generates approximately half the carbon dioxide that coal does. This transition, as noted by oil economist Philip Verleger Jr. in the International Economy, will also lead to increased production of oil and gas at lower prices, benefiting American consumers, manufacturers, and jobs.\n\nHowever, Verleger cautions that the falling prices of hydrocarbons could hinder the push for renewable energy programs. He also warns of the potential for the new technologies used to extract shale oil and gas to release large quantities of methane if not handled properly. Methane, when released into the atmosphere, contributes more to climate change than carbon dioxide.\n\nIn light of these concerns, environmentalists are urging the government to implement policies that discourage the use of carbon-intensive fuels and promote low-carbon energy. A carbon tax, they argue, would not only clean the air, drive clean-tech innovation, weaken petro-dictators, and reduce the deficit, but could also become part of the budget debate.\n\nPresident Obama, in his State of the Union address, vowed to foster policies that could \"cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.\" About 30 percent of energy in buildings is wasted. To fulfill this promise, the president could negotiate with power companies over the fairest way to achieve a 25 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from existing coal power plants and refiners.\n\nMoreover, the president could introduce the concept of \"natural infrastructure\" into the public discourse. Mark Tercek, the president and CEO of The Nature Conservancy, argues that forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems serve as nature's infrastructure for controlling floods, supplying water, and adapting to climate change. Investments in natural infrastructure, such as restoring dunes and wetlands, can provide storm protection and wildlife habitat, as demonstrated by Cape May, New Jersey, which was spared significant damage during Hurricane Sandy due to its restored dunes and wetlands.\n\nGiven the president's call for infrastructure investment during high unemployment, Tercek suggests emphasizing natural infrastructure as well. Federal programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Farm Bill can be expanded to make communities more resilient, while changes in the tax code and other federal rules can incentivize private investment.",
    " Title: President Obama Defends NSA Data Collection Programs as \"Modest Encroachments\" on Privacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hastily arranged news conference in San Jose, California on Friday, President Barack Obama defended his administration's controversial data collection programs, describing them as \"modest encroachments on privacy\" necessary for the fight against terrorism.\n\nThe President sought to quell a growing furor that erupted Wednesday night with the news that the National Security Agency (NSA), at the request of the FBI, was routinely collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers in the U.S. The government also acknowledged Thursday that the NSA is gathering Internet users' personal data, such as email, photos, and online chats in real time, from the computer servers of at least nine large Web service providers under a top-secret program called \"Prism.\"\n\nThe revelations have sparked a storm of protest among privacy advocates and in Congress, where many lawmakers said they were unaware of the scope of the programs. Mr. Obama said Friday that lawmakers are \"fully briefed\" on the programs periodically.\n\n\"Every member of Congress has been briefed on this program,\" Mr. Obama said. \"These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.\"\n\nWith regard to the surveillance of web data and emails, Mr. Obama insisted, \"This does not apply to U.S. citizens, and it does not apply to people living in the United States.\"\n\nThe President also addressed the possibility of government agents targeting individuals without probable cause. \"I will leave this office at some point, sometime in the next three and a half years,\" Mr. Obama said. \"After that I will be a private citizen. And I suspect that, on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails, or listen to their phone calls, I'd probably be pretty high on that list. So it's not as though I don't have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected.\"\n\nMr. Obama emphasized the need to balance national security interests with the protections of individual freedom guaranteed in the Constitution. \"I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,\" he said. \"My team evaluated them. My assessment, and my team's assessment, was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks.\"\n\nThe President also highlighted the system of checks and balances in place among federal judges, Congress, and the executive branch to ensure the surveillance programs are not abused. \"We've got congressional oversight and judicial oversight,\" he said. \"If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution and due process and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.\"\n\nHe concluded by stating that government employees involved in America's national security \"take this work very seriously.\" \"They cherish our Constitution,\" Mr. Obama said. \"They operate like professionals. The last thing they'd be doing is taking programs like this to listen to somebody's phone calls.\"",
    " Title: Majority of U.S. Intelligence Community Believes COVID-19 Originated in Wuhan Laboratory as an Accidental Leak\n\nThe majority of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) agencies have reached a consensus that the COVID-19 virus is a natural occurrence that accidentally leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China, according to a senior intelligence official. While not all of the 17 agencies that make up the IC fully endorse this theory, the majority believes it to be the case. The holdouts are still open to the possibility that the virus leaked from a laboratory.\n\nThe IC unanimously agrees that the virus was not the result of an intentional act, the senior official stated. This account aligns with reports from Fox News White House reporter John Roberts and President Donald Trump's public statements.\n\nRoberts reported on Saturday that there is agreement among most of the 17 Intelligence agencies that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab, with the source emphasizing that the release was believed to be a mistake, not intentional.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed on Thursday that the IC is \"rigorously\" investigating whether the virus was a result of a lab leak, while making clear that COVID-19 is not believed to be \"manmade or genetically modified.\"\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Trump stated that he has seen information that indicates with a high degree of confidence that the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. When asked by Roberts if he had seen anything that gave him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the virus, Trump answered, \"Yes, I have.\"\n\nThe senior intelligence official's account, Roberts' reports, and Trump's statements suggest a growing consensus within the U.S. Intelligence Community that the COVID-19 virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, as a result of an accidental leak. However, it is important to note that not all agencies have reached a definitive conclusion, and further investigation is ongoing.",
    " Title: Obama Highlights Benefits of Affordable Care Act, Criticizes Repeal Attempts by Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to emphasize the positive impacts of his health care law, President Barack Obama hosted a White House event on Thursday, inviting families who have received rebate checks from their insurance companies due to the Affordable Care Act's provision on medical care spending. The President criticized Republican lawmakers for their repeated attempts to repeal the law, labeling it as a political move.\n\n\"I recognize that there's still a lot of folks in this town at least who are rooting for this law to fail,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It's not\u2014I already have really good health care.\"\n\nThe President mocked the Republican lawmakers for their persistence in voting to repeal parts or all of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a move he described as re-fighting old battles.\n\n\"Sometimes I just try to figure out why,\" Mr. Obama said to laughter from his invited guests. \"Maybe they think it's good politics.\"\n\nThe event featured families who have benefited from the health care law's provision that provides consumers with a refund if their insurance company doesn't spend a set percentage of premium dollars on medical care and improving health care quality, rather than administrative costs or overhead.\n\nMorgan Theriot, a self-employed woman from Silver Spring, Md., was one of the families introduced by the President. She received a $267 refund check from her insurance company last summer after it didn't meet the requirement to spend at least 80 percent of her premium dollars on her health care.\n\n\"I'm curious\u2014what do opponents of this law think that folks here today should do with the money they were reimbursed?\" Mr. Obama asked. \"Should they send it back to the insurance companies? Do they think that was a bad idea, to make sure that insurance companies are being held accountable?\"\n\nHowever, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, countered the President's argument, stating that the President wasn't telling Americans the full story.\n\n\"What he won't say is that next year, Obamacare will impose a new sales tax on the purchase of health insurance that will cost Americans about $8 billion,\" Mr. McConnell said Thursday. \"If the administration is concerned with saving people money on their health care, I have some advice for them. Work with us to repeal Obamacare and start over.\"\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, echoed McConnell's sentiments, stating that the GOP will continue its efforts to repeal the law.\n\n\"The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,\" Mr. Boehner said. \"The law is costing American jobs; it's forcing people to give up health plans they like; and it's driving up the cost of care for families across America. In my home state, many Ohioans will pay nearly $200 more a month, on average, for individual plans. This law has to go.\"\n\nFor the law to work as its supporters envision, more young and healthy people need to sign up for insurance under the various health exchanges being set up in states. The audience at the White House included community groups who will be working at the grassroots level across the country to help enroll Americans in the new health insurance marketplaces this fall.\n\nThe President's pitch came a day after the House voted to delay mandates in the federal health care law requiring individuals and large employers to have coverage, with dozens of Democrats joining Republicans in poking a symbolic hole in the President's signature achievement.\n\nThirty-five Democrats joined with House Republicans to give large businesses a one-year reprieve on the requirement to provide health insurance for full-time employees, helping pass that provision on a 264-161 vote. The House also voted 251-174 to give individuals the same one-year break, with 22 Democratic lawmakers joining Republicans. The measures are certain to go nowhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nThe President chuckled at Republican lawmakers for repeatedly voting to repeal provisions of the law.\n\n\"Yesterday, despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it was supposed to for middle-class Americans, Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for nearly the 40th time to dismantle it,\" he said. \"We've got a lot of problems in this country, and there's a lot of work that Congress needs to do.\"\n\nMr. Obama also highlighted the benefits Americans are already seeing from the law, including in New York, where officials this week said individuals buying insurance on the state-based health care exchange in 2014 will see their premiums drop by an average of 50 percent compared with last year's direct-pay individual rates.\n\nThe President's progressive allies launched a TV ad campaign timed to coincide with the President's message. Americans United for Change went on the air with a new TV ad, \"Hands Off Obamacare,\" attempting to put the GOP on the defensive for trying to strip away provisions of the health law.\n\n\"Republicans want to take your benefits away and put insurance companies back in charge,\" says the announcer in the ad. \"Obamacare is working. Tell Republicans\u2014hands off Obamacare.\"\n\nThe administration announced in July that it was postponing for one year, until 2015, the law's requirement for employers with more than 50 workers to provide health insurance for all full-time employees. Sharon Stiller, an employment law specialist at the New York firm of Abrams, Fensterman, said many of her employer-clients expect the law's definition of \"part-time\" employee to be changed. Currently, the law defines a part-timer as any employee who works less than 30 hours per week.\n\n\"The word on the street is that there may be some changes with respect to the definition of 'part-time,'\" Ms. Stiller said. \"It's harder for employers to decide to do the necessary planning because they're not sure exactly what the final criterion will be.\"",
    " Title: Heritage Action's Decision to \"Key Vote\" on Obamacare Repeal Bill Complicates Republican Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected move, Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, has announced it will score a bill the House is set to vote on, which aims to repeal several components of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This decision could potentially complicate the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, as it puts pressure on conservatives to vote against a bill they had previously been enthusiastic about.\n\nThe bill, H.R. 3762, does not fully repeal Obamacare, including its major spending provisions such as the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for individuals to purchase insurance on the exchanges. By using the reconciliation process, Republicans can pass the bill with a simple majority in the Senate, but only provisions tied to spending can be included in the measure.\n\nPolicy experts agree that using budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare is the Republicans' best chance to put a repeal bill on President Obama's desk, even though the president is virtually guaranteed to veto it. The move by Heritage Action could inadvertently praise Democrats, who plan to vote against reconciliation because they support the healthcare law. A spokesman for Heritage Action would not confirm whether Democrats will receive a positive score from the organization for opposing the bill.\n\nIn the Obamacare fight, the aim of reconciliation is to set a legislative precedent for a Republican president to follow. Forcing a presidential veto of a bill repealing Obamacare will cause every presidential candidate to answer a simple question \u2013 what would you have done? Every serious Republican candidate will answer that they would repeal it in a heartbeat. However, if reconciliation is only used to remove a few provisions, it does not provoke the conversation and force a Republican nominee to continue to support repealing Obamacare in its entirety.\n\nIn addition to leaving one of Planned Parenthood's main funding sources intact, the reconciliation tool is ineffective in defunding Planned Parenthood because it does not contain sufficient leverage to succeed. The reconciliation tool can only place a standalone bill on the President's desk, which would be promptly vetoed. However, due to the recent Center for Medical Progress videos, there is sufficient political will to carry a defund effort past the finish line.\n\nH.R. 3762 is a net tax cut, a net spending cut, and a net cut in the deficit and debt. It repeals the most essential parts of Obamacare. It can not be filibustered by Harry Reid. It causes heartburn in the other team and will force President Obama to double down on the most unpopular parts of his healthcare law. It's a bill House conservatives can and should enthusiastically support.\n\nHowever, the organization's reasoning for its decision has been met with criticism. In order to use the \"reconciliation\" budgetary tool to roll back much of Obamacare, the maneuver must result in a net reduction of the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office's math. The only provisions of Obamacare that are eligible for repeal through this process are the ones directly pertaining to fiscal and budgetary issues. A House Ways and Means Committee spokesman tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the legislation that is slated to be voted on this week, and against which Heritage Action is lobbying, represents \"the best way to repeal the worst parts of the law.\" The constraints of reconciliation prohibit a repeal of the entire law.\n\nMany conservatives strongly support the measure, despite it not seeking to repeal each and every potentially-eligible provision of Obamacare. Ryan Ellis makes a detailed case, reaching this bottom line conclusion: \"So long as President Obama is sitting in the Oval Office twirling his veto pen, exactly zero major Obamacare repeal efforts will prevail (although ten different instances of piecemeal erosion have taken place via those dozens of repeal votes liberals enjoy mocking)\". Therefore, until at least 2017, all significant Obamacare repeal votes will be symbolic. And symbolism for the purposes of messaging and advancing the proverbial ball ought to be undertaken in a smart and strategic manner. Conservatives have demanded that Republicans utilize reconciliation \u2013 which Harry Reid and the Democrats used to ram the law through in 2010 \u2013 to at least get meaningful legislation onto the president's desk. This bill accomplishes that, targeting some of the law's crucial and most hated provisions.\n\nTo \"score\" against this legislation in such a way that would effectively punish Republicans for voting in favor of a sweeping anti-Obamacare bill (and perversely reward Democrats for opposing something they openly admit would ruin the law) seems like a counter-productive, water-muddying misadventure. Especially in times of divided government, the perfect must not be the enemy of the good. Obamacare is terrible. This bill is good, not perfect \u2013 yet somehow it's being seized upon as yet another occasion to assemble a self-defeating, divisive conservative circular firing squad. That laughing you hear is from the other side of the aisle.",
    " Title: President Obama and Mitt Romney Court Latino Voters Ahead of NALEO Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) convention this week, both President Barack Obama and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney are making a concerted effort to address the Latino community, a demographic crucial to their respective electoral strategies.\n\nOn Thursday, Romney will address the NALEO, while Obama will follow suit on Friday. The appearances come a week after President Obama announced a new policy that allows some undocumented young people to remain in the U.S. Romney has yet to denounce this move, and both candidates recognize the importance of Latino votes in their bid for the presidency.\n\nThe economy remains the primary focus of the presidential election, but issues such as contraception, gay marriage, and health care take a back seat. Immigration, however, has emerged as a significant side issue with potential electoral consequences.\n\nPrior to his recent policy announcement, Obama enjoyed the support of most Hispanic voters but not the enthusiasm they showed in 2008. This may be changing, in part, due to the decision not to deport young immigrants whose undocumented parents brought them to the U.S. as children.\n\nMatt Barreto, of Latino Decisions, a political opinion research group, reported a significant shift in Obama's favor on an enthusiasm measure, with a 50-point turnaround.\n\nRomney's stance on immigration has become a contentious issue. He has repeatedly declined to state whether he would continue Obama's policy. On Wednesday, a conference call on the economy organized by the Romney campaign was terminated after receiving three questions about immigration.\n\n\"He is trying to walk a line, not to sound hostile to Latinos,\" said Rick Santorum, Romney's former GOP presidential rival, on CNN. The challenge for Romney is that the president's new policy is popular with independent voters and Hispanics, but unpopular with many Republican base voters who view it as a form of amnesty. During the primaries, Romney himself criticized a similar policy known as the DREAM Act.\n\n\"If I were elected, and Congress were to pass the DREAM Act, would I veto it? And the answer is yes,\" Romney said at a campaign stop late last year. This statement is likely to be a recurring theme in the fall campaign. Obama has indicated he may use clips from the Republican primaries verbatim.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the Obama campaign's top political strategist, stated, \"Gov. Romney has no standing on this issue, on any of these issues, frankly. There's no reason for anyone in that community to see him as focused on their concerns and interests. He has dug himself in a great big hole.\"\n\nIn an election that may hinge on turnout among base voters, Romney cannot afford to alienate anti-amnesty conservatives. However, he still needs the Latino vote.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, whose efforts to craft a version of the DREAM Act were preempted by the president's new policy, referred to swing states with strong Hispanic populations such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico. In 2008, Obama won two-thirds of the Latino vote. Polls show he is still getting the same share, but with his support among white voters waning, he will need to register more Latinos and encourage them to vote.\n\nLatino registration has declined since 2008, but Barreto believes the president's decision to suspend certain deportations provides him with a campaign platform. \"There's something he can go out and campaign on. It's not just promises or 'I'll do this next time.' He actually has done something,\" Barreto said. \"And if there's a clear contrast there, with the other candidate saying, 'I don't know how I think about that,' that's a clear decision for Latinos. This is an important personal symbolic issue.\"\n\nRubio disagrees that immigration policy is the key to the Hispanic vote. \"This idea that Hispanics, all they think about is immigration 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is just not true. I mean, they're like everybody else in the country,\" he said. \"They're worried about the future. They're worried about their kids' future. Their house is worth less than it used to be worth.\"\n\nEd Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, believes there is a way for Republicans to surpass the 31% of the Hispanic vote Sen. John McCain of Arizona received in 2008. \"I believe a pro-legal immigration message, a pro-economic growth, a pro-job creation message, a pro-education reform message will be very resonant with Americans of Hispanic descent,\" Gillespie said. \"I believe as a result of that, we're going to see Gov. Romney's share of the Latino vote rise from the baseline of Sen. McCain's share.\"\n\nWhen Romney attends the NALEO political convention in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday, he will have an opportunity to present his case personally.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader McConnell Rejects Trump's Proposal for Simultaneous ObamaCare Repeal and Replace\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected President Trump's suggestion for the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) immediately and replace it later. In a statement on Friday, McConnell indicated that the Senate's bill, which includes significant changes to ObamaCare, remains challenging, and the Senate will stick with its current path.\n\nMcConnell's response came after Trump tweeted earlier in the day, suggesting that if Republican senators are unable to pass the current measure, they should immediately repeal the law and then replace it at a later date. The Kentucky Republican's statement echoed Trump's winning campaign slogan, \"It's not easy making America great again, is it?\"\n\nThe Senate introduced its bill about two weeks ago but left Washington for the July 4 recess without enough support from the chamber's 52 GOP senators to pass the measure. McConnell will need support from at least 50 of them, as the bill has no support among Senate Democrats. The GOP-controlled House passed its ObamaCare overhaul bill earlier this month.\n\nMcConnell is struggling to bridge the divide between moderates and conservatives within the Republican party. The president also tweeted his message shortly after Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse appeared on Fox & Friends to discuss a letter he had sent to Trump, suggesting a vote on repealing former President Barack Obama's health law followed by a new effort at working out a replacement. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also claimed credit for recommending the tactic to the president in a conversation earlier in the week.\n\nTrump's suggestion has the potential to harden divisions within the GOP, as conservatives like Paul and Sasse complain that McConnell's bill does not go far enough in repealing Obama's health care law, while moderates criticize it as overly harsh in kicking people off insurance rolls, shrinking the Medicaid safety net, and increasing premiums for older Americans.\n\nMcConnell has been trying to strike deals with members of both factions to finalize a rewritten bill that lawmakers can vote on when they return to the Capitol the second week of July. Even before Trump was inaugurated in January, Republicans had debated and ultimately discarded the idea of repealing the overhaul before replacing it, concluding that both must happen simultaneously. Doing otherwise would invite accusations that Republicans were simply tossing people off coverage and would roil insurance markets by raising the question of whether, when, and how Congress might replace Obama's law once it was gone.\n\nThe idea also would leave unresolved the quandary lawmakers are struggling with now, about how to replace Obama's system of online insurance markets, tax subsidies, and an expanded Medicaid with something that could get enough Republican votes to pass Congress. House Republicans barely passed their version of a replacement bill in May, and the task is proving even tougher in the Senate, where McConnell has almost no margin for error.\n\nModerates were spooked as the week began with a Congressional Budget Office finding that McConnell's draft bill would result in 22 million people losing insurance over the next decade, only 1 million fewer than under the House-passed legislation, which Trump privately told senators was \"mean.\" However, conservatives continue to insist that the bill must go further than just repealing some of the mandates and taxes in Obama's law.\n\nUnderscoring the fissures within the GOP, conservative group leaders on that call welcomed Trump's suggestion but said it did not go far enough because it could open the door to a subsequent bipartisan compromise to replace Obama's law. At the same time, a key House Republican, Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, rejected Trump's suggestion, contending that it \"does not achieve what President Trump set out to do.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Previews State of the Union Address, Blames Washington Dysfunction for Economic Contraction\n\nIn his weekly radio and Internet address, President Barack Obama, in what appears to be a preview of his upcoming State of the Union address, attributed the recent economic downturn - the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) contracting unexpectedly in the fourth quarter of 2012 - to \"bad decisions in Washington.\"\n\nThe president emphasized the overall health of the economy and cautioned against excessive focus on cutting government spending, stating, \"We all agree that it's critical to cut unnecessary spending. But we can't just cut our way to prosperity. It hasn't worked in the past, and it won't work today. It could slow down our recovery. It could weaken our economy. And it could cost us jobs - now, and in the future.\"\n\nInstead, the president advocated for a balanced approach, suggesting a combination of spending cuts and strategic investments in areas such as education, infrastructure, research, and development. He argued that these investments are essential for America to compete for the best jobs and new industries.\n\nThe president's remarks follow Wednesday's news that the American economy shrunk by 0.1 percent in the last quarter of 2012, a contraction that Democrats are increasingly attributing to the Republican Party's \"austerity politics.\"\n\nRepublicans, who have focused on reining in government spending since retaking the House in 2010, argue that government bailouts, stimulus projects, and higher taxes are hindering the economy. Democrats, on the other hand, contend that the economy would have been worse without the government spending and advocate for continued stimulus.\n\nIn his Saturday remarks, Mr. Obama defended the overall health of the economy, citing signs of progress such as rising home prices, increased car sales, a resurgence in manufacturing, and the creation of 2.2 million jobs in 2012. However, he also acknowledged the recent GDP report as a reminder of the negative impact of Washington's decisions on economic progress.\n\nThe president predicted a year of \"solid growth\" in 2013, provided Washington could avoid \"self-inflicted wounds.\"",
    " Title: \"Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare's Individual Mandate: A Look at the Origination Clause and the Affordable Care Act\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of tax season and the ongoing debate surrounding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), a new challenge to the law's \"individual mandate\" is making headlines. The case, filed by Matt Sissel, an Iowa small business owner, questions the constitutionality of the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to either purchase health insurance or face a penalty, labeled as a \"tax\" by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Obama administration never argued that the individual mandate is an exercise of Congress' taxing authority, and President Obama himself has maintained that the individual mandate is a regulatory action authorized by the Commerce Clause. However, the Supreme Court's decision on Obamacare last June labeled the individual mandate as a \"tax,\" creating a potential constitutional issue.\n\nArticle I, Section 7 of the Constitution, known as the Origination Clause, states that tax bills must \"originate in the House of Representatives.\" The framers wrote this clause to keep the taxing power close to voters and entrusted it to members of the House, who are elected every two years and have smaller constituencies than senators.\n\nHowever, Obamacare did not follow the constitutional script. Instead of originating in the lower chamber, it started in the Senate, when Majority Leader Harry Reid took an old bill the House had passed that would have given veterans tax credits to buy homes, struck out all of that bill's language, and inserted instead the confusing web of provisions that became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe question of Obamacare's constitutionality, particularly in relation to the Origination Clause, is now before US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C. The case highlights the controversial and contentious nature of the Affordable Care Act, which was passed hastily, without thorough review, and through questionable procedural tricks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has yet to address whether the Senate can evade the Origination Clause by hollowing out a House bill and substituting its own tax. Randy Barnett, a Georgetown University Law School professor and leading constitutional critic of Obamacare, has written that if any act violates the Origination Clause, it would seem to be the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Constitution's procedural guidelines, while seemingly dry formalities, were designed to safeguard the rights of the American people. If the Supreme Court's decision on Obamacare is not to become a precedent for Congress to impose any variety of mandates on Americans under the taxing power, courts should take care to enforce democratic controls over that power.\n\nTimothy Sandefur, a principal attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation, is representing small business owner Matt Sissel in challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate \"tax.\" The case underscores the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding the Affordable Care Act, and the importance of adhering to the Constitution's procedural guidelines to protect the rights of American citizens.",
    " Title: Nike Taps Controversial Figure Colin Kaepernick for 30th Anniversary \"Just Do It\" Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is sure to stir debate, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been announced as one of the faces for Nike's \"Just Do It\" 30th anniversary campaign. Kaepernick, who ignited a nationwide controversy in 2016 by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police violence against African-Americans, is now featured in the advertising campaign alongside other sports stars such as Odell Beckham Jr and Shaquem Griffin.\n\nKaepernick's decision to kneel during the anthem sparked a divisive response, with President Donald Trump referring to players who \"disrespect\" the U.S. flag as \"sons of bitches\" and calling for them to be fired. The protest has been a contentious issue, with the NFL and Kaepernick currently embroiled in a lawsuit, with the quarterback arguing that team owners froze him out due to his activism.\n\nThe Nike adverts feature Kaepernick with the slogan, \"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\" The star took to Twitter on Monday to share the advert and the slogan. Gino Fisanotti, Nike's vice president of branding for North America, was quoted by cable sports network ESPN as saying, \"We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward.\"\n\nOther stars of the Nike campaign, including tennis great Serena Williams, have expressed their support for Kaepernick. However, the announcement has not been without criticism, with some taking to social media to use the #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt hashtags, a play on the company's slogan. Country star John Rich posted a photo of a pair of socks with the Nike emblem cut off.\n\nKaepernick, who remained on a contract with Nike throughout the kneeling row, has now renegotiated his deal to be part of the anniversary campaign. In May, the NFL announced that teams whose players who knelt for the national anthem would be fined under a new policy. The league said players not willing to stand for The Star-Spangled Banner could stay in the changing rooms until it had been performed. However, the new policy is yet to be implemented as negotiations between the league and the players' union are ongoing.",
    " Title: White House Defends Melania Trump's Response to Criticism, Distinguishes Son Barron Trump from Greta Thunberg\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, the White House has defended First Lady Melania Trump's response to criticism, stating that her defense of her teenage son, Barron Trump, does not equate to hypocrisy for not criticizing her husband's attack on 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham stated on Friday that Barron and Thunberg are in different categories, with the latter being a global climate activist who travels the world giving speeches. Grisham's statement came a day after President Trump attacked TIME Magazine's decision to name Thunberg \"Person of the Year.\"\n\n\"So ridiculous,\" Trump tweeted. \"Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!\"\n\nThe first lady had previously defended her son after a Stanford University law professor mentioned him during a House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing. \"A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it,\" the first lady said in response to a quip by Pamela Karlan.\n\nTIME named Greta Thunberg its 2019 Person of the Year, a decision that has been met with controversy, including from President Trump. The first lady's stance on the matter has led to accusations of hypocrisy, given her husband's habit of mocking political opponents and others on Twitter.\n\n\"It is no secret that the president and first lady often communicate differently\u2014as most married couples do,\" Grisham said.\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama encouraged Thunberg while traveling in Vietnam this week, saying, \"Don't let anyone dim your light.\" Mrs. Obama added, \"Like the girls I've met in Vietnam and all over the world, you have so much to offer us all. Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on.\"\n\nThunberg responded to Trump's attack by changing her Twitter profile description to describe herself as a \"teenager working on her anger management problem.\"\n\nThe first lady's stance on the matter has been a subject of debate, with some criticizing her for not extending the same protection to Thunberg that she did to her son. However, the White House maintains that the two situations are not comparable.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Shifts Power Towards Activist Base Amidst Rising Liberal Coalition and Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the Democratic National Committee is eliminating superdelegates, elected officials and party elites who traditionally help determine presidential nominees. This shift is expected to grant more authority to the activist base, a group that is increasingly influencing the party's agenda.\n\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who was among those arrested during last week's immigration protest, emphasized the need for the party to focus on its base. \"We have to pay attention to our base,\" she said, pointing to a series of special elections and primaries, including that of Rep. Joseph Crowley, as evidence of a rising liberal coalition asserting its power. \"That energy, combined with the real threat of a second Supreme Court justice that could strip away women's reproductive rights and a lot of other rights that people have come to rely on \u2014 I think it is an even bigger call to action,\" Jayapal added.\n\nThis shift in the Democratic Party mirrors the turmoil experienced by Republicans during the first two years of President Obama's administration, when the Democratic Party held all the levers of government, leaving the Tea Party-inflected Republican Party to protest in impotent fury.\n\nSome Democrats view this moment as akin to the era following the Vietnam War and Watergate, when the reaction to a controversial Republican president triggered a moderate and liberal backlash. This movement delivered dozens of new seats, but it also ushered in a generational changing of the guard that jolted party leaders.\n\nFormer Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, elected in the Democratic wave of 1974 and a leader in the effort to reinvent the Democratic Party in the 1980s, sees the current moment as a time of reckoning for the party. He believes the party has failed for years to define a forward-looking vision. The pressure of the midterm election\u2014heightened, he says, by the Supreme Court vacancy\u2014could create a new moment of definition.\n\n\"There almost has to be a generational renewal of belief systems,\" said Hart, a two-time presidential candidate, who is now 81. \"When we were in power, under Obama and Clinton, I don't believe party leaders did what should have been done, and that is come up with a manifesto for the 21st century.\"",
    " Title: House Approves $1.37 Trillion Spending Package, Averting Government Shutdown\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has passed a $1.37 trillion spending package, a move that could prevent a government shutdown scheduled for this Friday. The bill, which now heads to the Senate for approval, includes funding for President Donald Trump's border wall, increased tobacco purchasing age, and gun violence research.\n\nThe spending package, broken down into two bills, marks the first of three significant votes this week in the House. The remaining votes include a historic impeachment vote against President Trump and a new North American trade deal.\n\nPresident Trump has yet to comment on the spending deal, reached after months of negotiations between House and Senate leaders. The administration's desire for a border wall along the southern U.S. border was a key point of contention during last year's 35-day government shutdown.\n\nThe spending deal maintains the wall's funding at $1.375 billion, similar to last year's allocation. However, the administration retains the ability to reallocate funds from other government accounts, a compromise as Democrats sought to limit the administration's spending adjustments after being denied by Congress.\n\nWhile the amount falls short of the $8.6 billion the president requested, some House Democrats remain opposed to the agreement. Shortly before the vote, the Hispanic Caucus expressed opposition to the inclusion of wall funding and detention beds for immigrants.\n\nThe caucus, comprising about 40 lawmakers, stated that the bill's benefits did not \"outweigh the serious issues that remain.\" They argued that without reining in the administration's ability to move funds, the spending bill would allow the administration to continue redirecting billions from national security priorities to border security.\n\nLiberals secured a 3.1% raise for federal workers, upgrades to election systems, and $25 million in gun violence research, a significant shift after decades of resistance from the gun lobby.\n\n\"I\u2019m pleased that we have reached a bipartisan agreement that will keep government open, provide the certainty of full-year funding, and make strong investments in key priorities for American communities,\" said House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.\n\nThe deal also includes a ban on flavored vape products, expected soon, with menthol and vape stores potentially being spared. The increased use of vaping and e-cigarettes among young people prompted this measure. As of the end of October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 34 deaths and 1,604 lung injury cases related to vaping.\n\nThe deal also includes a permanent repeal of the \"Cadillac Tax,\" a 40% tax on higher employer insurance plans that was part of the Affordable Care Act. The deal would raise the age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, a move that gained support due to the increased use of vaping and e-cigarettes among young people.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., stated, \"These bills include a long list of priorities that will benefit people across the country. This is what the American people deserve \u2013 for us to fulfill our primary responsibility \u2013 funding the government.\"",
    " Title: Addressing the Mental Health Crisis Among Adolescents and Young Adults: A Call for Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, the question \"Do you know where your children are?\" has taken on a new meaning. While physical safety remains a concern, the advent of social technology has introduced a new dimension to this question, as children can now engage in risky online behavior without leaving the comfort of their homes.\n\nA recent study by the Pew Research Center found that 92% of teens go online daily, with 24% reporting constant use. However, contrary to popular belief, Facebook is not their favorite social network, with only 15% of kids choosing it as their preferred platform. Instead, 33% of teens favor Instagram, 20% opt for Twitter, and 19% prefer Snapchat, an app that allows for the sharing of temporary, often explicit, images.\n\nThis shift in social media preferences coincides with a rise in anxiety and depression among adolescents, teenagers, and young adults. A 2014 National College Health Assessment survey of nearly 80,000 college students throughout the United States found that 54% of students reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety in the past 12 months, and 32.6% \"felt so depressed that it was difficult to function\" during the same period. The study also revealed that 6.4% had intentionally harmed themselves, 8.1% had seriously considered suicide, and 1.3% had attempted suicide.\n\nThese statistics are alarming, and the responsibility for this mental health crisis lies, in part, with us. Children are growing up in a world where they expect immediate response, gratification, and notification. Their brains have not had time to evolve; they must adapt to change in an instant, and the results are distressing.\n\nSocial technology provides a platform where things can run wild. The stress of high school \u2013 the competition for popularity, the pressure to fit in, the judgmental nature of social activities \u2013 is amplified online. As children transition to college, they face additional pressures.\n\nTo address this issue, several remedies have been suggested:\n\n1. Creating more structured forms of social media that prevent children from diving headfirst into the digital world.\n2. Providing a way for parents and administrators to get feedback on their children's online use without invading privacy and alerting them to potential dangers.\n3. Incorporating courses on social technology and responsibility into school curricula to educate adolescents about the long-term consequences of their online actions.\n4. Easing up on the pressure to perform and promoting social media as a tool for fostering collaborative relationships rather than a medium for fueling competition, aggression, and irresponsible behavior.\n5. Offering more mental health support in schools and colleges, addressing mental health issues proactively rather than waiting for symptoms to surface.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial that we, as a society, take action to address the mental health crisis among adolescents and young adults. By implementing these remedies, we can help create a safer, healthier digital environment for our children to grow and thrive in.",
    " Title: Trump Invites Congressional Leaders for Border Security Briefing as Government Shutdown Enters Second Week\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to a border security briefing at the White House as the federal government remains partially shut down over the president's demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The president's invitation, described by congressional sources as a briefing and not a negotiating session, was sent to the top two Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThe House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no signs of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in its second week. About a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 workers affected.\n\nDemocrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. However, its prospects are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measures but has since fallen in line with Trump's demands for funding for the border wall.\n\nThe legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell. In a letter to colleagues, Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said, \"We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer.\"\n\nTrump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure. \"Border Security and the Wall'thing'and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Trump calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nThe Democrats' two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras. The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce, and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. The House Democrats' measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants in wall funding. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump.",
    " Title: Retailers See Strong Black Friday Sales Amid Reduced Inventories and Fewer Discounts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from previous years, retailers found themselves in a favorable position on Black Friday as consumers moved towards e-commerce, leaving stores with less inventory and the need for fewer discounts to attract shoppers. The National Retail Federation expects Black Friday sales to reach around $33 billion, a 4.8% increase from last year, and sales for November and December to climb by about 4% to some $682 billion.\n\nMacy's Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Gennette stated that the retailer had made adjustments based on past years and was well-positioned for the shopping bonanza. \"We don't have the albatross of a lot of extra inventory like we did last year,\" he said. Macy's is offering fewer promotions, according to Gennette, and is in a good shape, but cautioned, \"we've still got five weeks ahead of us\" until Christmas.\n\nThe average Black Friday advertised discount across 17 categories was 45% this year, compared with 48% last year, according to price-tracking firm Market Track LLC. Only three of eight major retailers offered deeper discounts than they did a year ago, the firm said.\n\nDespite fewer discounts, shoppers were still able to find deals. Kevin Krause, 27, was first in line outside the Kohl's store in Medford, Ore. on Thanksgiving afternoon. He bought an Xbox One videogame console that was on sale for $189.\n\nAnalysts have been predicting robust holiday sales amid rising wages, low unemployment, and strong consumer confidence. Jena Thomas, a university student shopping with her mother at a Target in Chicago, bought two TVs that she couldn't get earlier at Best Buy. She also splurged on a PlayStation 4 console and videogames. \"I caught up with all my Christmas shopping,\" she said.\n\nTraditional stores continue to grapple with sluggish sales as more shopping takes place online. However, a bright spot has emerged: stores aren't sitting on piles of excess goods like they were a year ago. Bill Dreher, a retail research analyst with Susquehanna International, stated, \"Because inventory management was quite good coming out of the third quarter, there's not going to be a need for aggressive promotions in the fourth quarter to clear out unsold goods.\"\n\nOnline sales on Thanksgiving increased 18% to $2.87 billion, according to software company Adobe Systems Inc. As of 8 p.m. Friday, shoppers had spent $3.54 billion, up 16%. Adobe expects online sales to increase 14% to $107.4 billion for the November-December period, compared with the previous year. Amazon said Thanksgiving was one of its biggest mobile shopping days, as orders placed through its app increased more than 50% over last year. Best-selling items included Keurig coffee makers and its Echo speaker devices.",
    " Title: The Impact of Gender Diversity in Venture Capital on Female Entrepreneurship\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study has shed light on the significant role gender diversity in venture capital plays in promoting female entrepreneurship. According to Professor Gompers, who testified in the discrimination trial that Ms. Pao lost, investment returns are not solely dependent on an individual's track record, but also on the presence of diverse colleagues. Surprisingly, the study found that on average, women are not benefiting from their male colleagues in the venture capital industry.\n\nVenture capitalists, often seen as the gatekeepers to Silicon Valley, tend to invest in entrepreneurs who resemble themselves, often being white men who have studied at institutions like Stanford. A report from Babson College reveals that venture firms with women as partners are three times more likely to invest in a company with a female CEO and twice as likely to invest in one with women on the management team.\n\nThe lack of female investors has a domino effect. Start-ups' boards, primarily composed of venture capitalists, are often all male. A recent Fortune analysis found that only 5% of the 81 start-ups worth more than $1 billion had a female CEO, and 6% had a woman on the board. Other studies have shown that male founders and directors are less likely to hire women as executives and engineers, or pay men and women equally.\n\nBrit Morin, founder and CEO of Brit & Co, emphasizes the need for more female venture capitalists, stating, \"Honestly, there will be more female entrepreneurs if there are more female venture capitalists.\"\n\nFemale investors, such as Sonja Hoel Perkins, founder of Broadway Angels, and Theresia Gouw, a founder of Aspect Ventures, reported that they did not specifically seek to invest in companies founded by women, but due to their networks, they received more pitches from female entrepreneurs. Forty percent of Perkins' angel investments have been in companies started by women, a significantly higher proportion than typical venture funds. This trend is also observed in 30% of Cowboy Ventures' investments and more than 40% of Aspect Ventures' 13 investments.\n\nGouw, a former partner at Accel, notes the benefits of having female investors evaluate products and serve on boards, given that more than half of the users of many mobile and social services are women. The study underscores the importance of gender diversity in venture capital for promoting female entrepreneurship and fostering a more inclusive and equitable ecosystem.",
    " Title: Renewed Efforts to Transfer Detainees from Guantanamo Bay Amidst Political Pressure and Ongoing Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, remains open, contrary to President Obama's early promises to close it. However, detainees are being released in a gradual manner. In a recent development, five Taliban prisoners were exchanged in May for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Since the November midterm elections, there has been a new wave of transfers from Guantanamo, with more releases in the pipeline.\n\nSeven low-level detainees have been moved to other countries this month, reducing the number of inmates at the facility to 142. More than half of the remaining detainees are also approved for some form of transfer.\n\nDavid Rothkopf, CEO of the FP Group which publishes Foreign Policy magazine, comments, \"The Obama administration came in with some stated goals with regard to dismantling Guantanamo that they have not been able to follow through on thus far, and we are six years in, so I think they're feeling the pressure.\"\n\nLaura Pitter, from advocacy group Human Rights Watch, adds, \"It does seem like there is a renewed effort to reinvigorate the transfers out of Guantanamo.\" Pitter notes that transfers stalled after the prisoner swap for Sergeant Bergdahl, with GOP lawmakers expressing outrage over the lack of the required 30-day notice for the transfer.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in a statement to the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized his responsibility for all prisoner transfers from Guantanamo, stating, \"I take that responsibility, Mr. Chairman, members of this committee, damn seriously.\"\n\nFollowing this episode, nearly five months passed without any further transfers. This period coincided with the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) and a new House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, who argued that continuing such releases was unwise. At a recent hearing, McKeon questioned, \"Secretary Hagel, isn't this in conflict with your policy of stemming the flow of terrorists?\"\n\nHagel responded, \"The intelligence community assessed that more than 90 percent of those detainees had not intended to or had in fact, we had not received any credible evidence of recidivism.\"\n\nTen days later, Hagel announced he was stepping down. He had already notified Congress of the planned transfers. However, a new Congress, entirely run by Republicans, could potentially stall the new drive to empty Guantanamo.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Call for Full, Clean Repeal of Obamacare After Repeal-and-Replace Bill Fails\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 In a late-night development on Monday, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the full and clean repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The call came after four Republican senators withdrew their support for the repeal-and-replace bill, leaving McConnell without the 50 votes needed to pass the Obamacare rewrite.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement at 11:48 p.m., stating, \"Regretfully, it is not apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure Obamacare will not be successful. In the coming days, the Senate will vote to take up the House bill with the first amendment in order being what a majority of the Senate already supported in 2015 and that was vetoed by then-President Obama: a repeal of Obamacare with a two-year delay to provide for a state transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americans access to quality, affordable care.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine had previously opposed the Senate's second repeal-and-replace bill. They were joined on Monday by Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas.\n\nPresident Trump had previously tweeted on June 30, \"If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!\"\n\nThe plan to pass a clean repeal bill was first advocated by conservatives, including Sen. Paul and Heritage Action, who believed the horse-trading necessary to accomplish both repeal and replace at the same time would hobble the effort. Their plan was to push for a two-year window where congressmen and senators could craft replacement legislation after Obamacare's fate was set.\n\nDemocrats, who have vowed to torpedo any GOP effort to repeal Obamacare, might then be pulled to the negotiation table, enabling Washington to pass a bill with support from both parties. However, the likelihood of bipartisan support is still low, given the current political climate, the parties' widely differing agendas, and the polarized mood of the parties' supporters.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Softens Stance on Paris Climate Accord, Secretary of State Tillerson Suggests Possibility of Remaining in Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has indicated that the Trump administration is open to remaining in the Paris Agreement on climate change, contradicting previous statements from the White House. Tillerson's comments come just hours after the White House insisted there would be \"no change\" to U.S. policy.\n\nDuring an interview with U.S. network CBS, Tillerson suggested that the U.S. might not leave the accord at all, stating, \"I think, under the right conditions, the president has said he's open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others, on what we all agree is still a challenging issue.\"\n\nThis development follows reports on Saturday suggesting that President Trump had softened his attitude towards the agreement. EU's top climate official, Miguel Arias Canete, reported that Trump officials had indicated the U.S. would not renegotiate the Paris accord but \"try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement.\"\n\nHowever, later the same day, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement, \"There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement.\" Sanders reiterated that the U.S. is withdrawing unless it can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to the country.\n\nNational Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, in an appearance on ABC's This Week program on Sunday, echoed Sanders' words more closely than Tillerson, stating, \"He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States.\"\n\nDespite this potential shift in policy, an improved deal is likely to face resistance from Trump's base support, many of whom are vehemently opposed to the 2015 agreement. The Paris accord commits the U.S. and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and \"endeavor to limit\" them even more, to 1.5\u00b0C. Opponents argue that withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of U.S. leadership on a key global challenge.",
    " Title: San Jose Mayor Proposes Mandatory Liability Insurance for Gun Owners in Response to Shooting Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the issue of gun violence, the mayor of San Jose, California, has proposed a new policy that would require all gun owners in the city to carry liability insurance for their firearms. The proposal, as reported by KTVU-TV, includes coverage for accidental discharges and actions taken by third parties who may borrow, steal, or obtain the guns through other means.\n\nMayor Sam Liccardo (D) stated, \"We have to solve problems. While this is far from a complete solution, it is something we can do to reduce the harms of firearms, without waiting for Congress to take action.\" The proposal is being referred to as a \"harm reduction\" approach, modeled after existing policies such as automobile insurance and tobacco taxes.\n\nThe proposal comes in the wake of the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, where two victims were children from San Jose \u2013 13-year-old Keyla Salazar and 6-year-old Stephen Romero. Mayor Liccardo emphasized the need for action, stating, \"The costs of gun violence are far too high. If you need to have insurance to drive an automobile and follow safety guidelines, then why shouldn't you need insurance to operate and keep a gun safely?\"\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) praised the move, calling it \"another tremendous step\" in a Monday tweet. He further stated, \"The costs of gun violence are far too high. If you need to have insurance to drive an automobile and follow safety guidelines, then why should you not need insurance to operate and keep a gun safely?\"\n\nOpponents of the proposal argue that it is an unnecessary burden on law-abiding gun owners. City council member Johnny Khamis stated, \"This could be seen by gun owners who are doing everything legally as a punishment.\" The National Rifle Association (NRA) also criticized the proposal, labeling it as \"another tax on law-abiding gun owners.\" Spokesperson Amy Hunter noted, \"Criminals are already ignoring California's more than 800 gun laws, so it's doubtful many of them would rush out and get liability insurance.\"\n\nThe proposal is currently under discussion, and its implementation will depend on the city council's approval. The aim is to reduce the impact of gun violence in San Jose, with Mayor Liccardo emphasizing, \"We require motorists to carry automobile insurance, and the insurance industry appropriately encourages and rewards safe driver behavior. We tax tobacco consumption both to discourage risky behavior and to make sure non-smokers are not forced to subsidize the substantial public health costs generated by smoking-related illnesses and deaths.\"",
    " Title: Trump Son's Emails Reveal Meeting with Russian Lawyer Was Part of Russian Government's Support for Trump Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of emails published by Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter Tuesday, the president's eldest son revealed that he was informed ahead of a June 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer that the material damaging to Hillary Clinton that he was offered was \"part of a Russian government effort to aid his father's candidacy.\"\n\nThe emails, which were published shortly before the New York Times was set to publish them, show that Trump Jr. was told by publicist Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, that \"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nIn response, Trump Jr. replied, \"I love it.\"\n\nThe latest revelation comes after the White House spent Monday defending President Trump's eldest son following another Times report that the meeting last summer was intended to get damaging information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In a statement Sunday, Trump Jr. said he did not know who he was meeting with beforehand, but had been told the person \"might have information helpful to the campaign.\" He said the meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya yielded no useful details.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort \u2014 who would later briefly serve as campaign manager \u2014 and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who now serves as a White House senior adviser.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Monday that \"Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election.\" She added that the only inappropriate aspect of the meeting was the leaking of information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that he \"absolutely\" wanted to talk to Trump's son, calling it part of a \"continuing pattern we've seen since the election of Trump campaign and Trump administration officials who have conveniently forgotten meetings with Russians.\"\n\nWarner said, \"If I was a campaign manager and had been contacted by what may be an agent of a foreign power and was told that agent may have damaging information about a potential candidate, I think I would remember that meeting. And I think it's also a little strange, as a candidate, if my son or son-in-law met with an official or an agent of a foreign power. I think I'd probably want to hear about that information.\"\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended the president's son on CNN Monday morning, emphasizing that there was \"no action taken. Nothing\" that resulted from the meeting.\n\n\"Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he did not even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,\" Conway said. \"He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.\"\n\nPolitico reported earlier Monday that Trump Jr.'s actions and statements \"put him potentially in legal cross hairs for violating federal criminal statutes prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of anything of value from a foreign national, as well as a conspiracy to defraud the United States,\" and he, Manafort, and Kushner \"may have also exposed themselves to future blackmail threats,\" according to legal experts.\n\nTrump Jr. has hired New York attorney Alan Futerfas to represent himself in matters regarding the Russia investigations. The Daily Caller reported that Futerfas has previously represented Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national who was found guilty of creating a malware virus that infected over 40,000 U.S. computers, including ones at NASA.\n\n\"In my view, this is much ado about nothing,\" Futerfas told the Times following the Monday evening story. \"Don Jr.'s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.\"",
    " Title: Cory Booker Delays Presidential Campaign Announcement, Cites Importance of Building a Strong Foundation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker has delayed his much-anticipated presidential campaign announcement, choosing instead to focus on building a strong foundation for his bid. In a conversation with a journalist, Booker expressed his decision as a means of ensuring a well-prepared and well-organized campaign, rather than rushing into the race.\n\nBooker, known for his empathetic and compassionate approach, compared the process of running for president to a hurdle race, emphasizing the importance of keeping one's focus on the immediate task at hand. He stated, \"If you're looking to the lanes to your left or your right, you're going to trip.\"\n\nWhen asked about his delayed entry into the race, Booker expressed a sense of liberation and spoke about the importance of vulnerability and truth in leadership. He referenced historical figures who stood before fire hoses and armed troops unarmed, emphasizing the strength he sees in those who display courage and truth.\n\nThe delay in Booker's announcement had left many Democratic operatives and political observers puzzled, as he was widely expected to join the race earlier. The speculation surrounding his campaign intensified when other high-profile candidates entered the race, and Booker's apparent absence became a running joke among Democratic circles.\n\nHowever, Booker's team has clarified that the delay was a strategic decision, aimed at allowing more time to finesse their organization and plan. The team believes that the benefits of a more thoroughly prepared campaign outweigh any potential advantages of an earlier announcement.\n\nAs the primary season approaches, Booker joins a crowded field of Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Senator Kamala Harris, among others. Booker's team remains confident that their strategy will pay off, and the senator looks forward to offering a strong spirit of love, kindness, grace, and decency, along with his policy ideas, to the American public.",
    " Title: California Secessionists Rally for Independence on Independence Day, While Other Movements Pursue Different Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Americans across the nation celebrate Independence Day with picnics and parades, a group of Californians are taking the holiday's theme of independence quite literally. The Yes California independence campaign, also known as Calexit, plans to rally on Wednesday at the state capitol in Sacramento, calling on like-minded residents to \"stand up against American occupation of California\" and for Trump supporters to \"get out of California.\"\n\nThe Calexit campaign, which is collecting signatures to place a secession measure on the 2020 ballot, issued an Independence Day message stating, \"The Fourth of July is no longer a day to celebrate in California.\" The campaign has generated controversy with its effort to spin off California as a separate country, but billionaire Tim Draper generated the biggest headlines in April when he qualified his three-Californias measure for the November ballot.\n\nThe initiative, now named Proposition 9, is aimed at making California more governable by dividing it into three more manageable states named Southern California, which would include San Diego and the Central Valley; Northern California, encompassing San Francisco; and California, which would hold Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's beautiful weather, I love California, but it's now 50th in quality of life because people can't afford to live here, and they move,\" Mr. Draper said Monday on Fox Business. So far, Proposition 9 has shown little support in the polls, but Mr. Draper said the proposal is moving in the right direction.\n\n\"It started at 13 percent in favor and then it went to 17 percent in favor and now you said 27 percent in favor,\" Mr. Draper said. \"What happens is as people start thinking about it, they say, yeah, I'd like to see my kids have a better education, yeah I'd like to have better infrastructure, yeah, I'd like to have lower taxes, and I think you could have all that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another secession movement, New California, seeks not to secede but to split the state in two along rural-urban lines, following procedures laid out in Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. About 200 members of New California fanned out Tuesday to read the organization's latest \"grievance against the state of California\" on the steps of 18 county court and government buildings.\n\n\"The Founding Fathers laid down their grievances in the Declaration of Independence, and that's the process we're following,\" said New California co-founder Paul Preston. \"It's really kind of exciting to see the Declaration of Independence utilized again.\"\n\nThe group issued its own declaration of independence on Jan. 15, and has since relayed 24 grievances, one per week, as it seeks to gain county support and ultimately persuade the state legislature to divide the state.\n\n\"Our message is we're actually in the process of a real Declaration of Independence procedure,\" said Mr. Preston. \"It's playing out exactly that way.\"\n\nIn a separate development, the State of Jefferson, which has filed a federal lawsuit in search of a two-state solution, also has much in common with the nation's founding. Spokesman Terry Gherardi said his movement also has much in common with the nation's founding.\n\n\"As we celebrate the 4th of July and our independence, the 23 Counties of the State of Jefferson remind everyone, the importance of equal representation for all citizens in the 58 Counties of California and other states, we the people of Jefferson also seek our independence from the oligarchy governing the State of California, forming the new State of Jefferson,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe tone couldn't be more different at Calexit, where organizers Louis Marinelli and Marcus Ruiz Evans have framed their independence campaign as a reaction to American imperialism and the Trump administration. Calexit's Fourth of July message blasted the \"ancestors of those undocumented immigrants from the United States who settled in California without invitation, decimated the local population through disease and genocide, stole the natural resources from under their feet, and declared California an American territory.\"\n\n\"For the 172nd time, these Americans, now numbering in the millions with just as many American flags and Donald Trump's red baseball caps, will celebrate their independence this Wednesday on occupied land. How ironic,\" said the statement. \"But you can bet the Yes California Independence Campaign will not sit quietly along the sidelines.\"\n\nCalexit seeks to qualify a ballot measure that would direct California's governor to work with Congress on separating the state from the rest of the nation. The movement's approach to independence is a stark contrast to the more traditional secession movements in California, but it reflects the diversity of opinions and approaches to governance in the state.",

During the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, Pence stated that beyond the new 15-minute tests by Abbott Laboratories, a new antibody test, which may be FDA-approved in the near future, will also be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month.\n\nPence's comments may refer to Abacus Pharma International (API), a company that produces a coronavirus antibody test called \"COVID-Rapid.\" The test, a simple blood test that can return results in 15 minutes, has a 100% accuracy for detecting old infections but is not designed to diagnose COVID-19. Tens of thousands of tests are currently in a warehouse in Pompano Beach, waiting to be distributed. Puerto Rico has already ordered 3 million tests, and the company also plans to donate 10,000 tests to the city of Miami.\n\nCEO Vincent DeGennaro of Abacus Pharma International expressed excitement about contributing to the fight against the virus. \"This is not about selling tests for us,\" DeGennaro said. \"This is about getting people back to work and helping repair our damaged economy and to try and minimize the impact the disease can have in our community here in Miami.\"\n\nEarlier in the press conference, Pence highlighted Dr. Deborah Birx's efforts in expanding testing capabilities nationwide. \"Dr. Birx has been leading an effort for the task force from early on on rapidly expanding testing,\" Pence said. \"It was early on that the president formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs, and as we stand here today, more than 2.5 million tests have been performed.\"\n\nPence also mentioned that the new 15-minute test, in collaboration with Abbott Laboratories, is being rapidly increased in availability. \"Abbott is producing roughly 50,000 cartridges a day,\" Pence continued. \"FEMA acquired an initial supply of that and distributed those to the states. We are working with the states to not only distribute what's being made but also work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.",

The shooting occurred after a neighbor called the police about an open front door.\n\nAccording to attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Jefferson's family, the officer did not have time to perceive a threat before opening fire. Merritt stated that the officer did not shout \"Gun, gun, gun\" before firing, which he described as \"murder.\"\n\nJefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. Her family told KXAS television that she was killed early Saturday morning. The Fort Worth Police Department stated that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat.\"\n\nThe bodycam video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" One shot is then fired through a window.\n\nJefferson's sister, Amber Carr, expressed her disappointment in the police response, stating, \"It's another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department has confirmed that the officer who shot Jefferson did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot. The officer, who has been on the force since April 2018, is expected to be interviewed about the shooting on Monday.\n\nAt a brief news conference at police headquarters, Fort Worth Police Lt. Brandon O'Neil declined to answer reporters' questions and stated that Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus plans to conduct a more in-depth news conference on Monday.\n\nJames Smith, who called a police non-emergency number about the open door, expressed remorse for his role in the incident, stating, \"If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident to provide transparency, but any \"camera footage inside the residence\" cannot be distributed due to state law. The bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home. It is unclear if the firearm was found near the woman, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has called on the Justice Department to investigate the shooting. \"The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end,\" Sanders tweeted. \"Atatiana Jefferson should be alive.\"\n\nThe shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her black neighbor inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger, 31, said during her trial that she mistook the apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean's. Merritt also represents Jean's family.",

Two individuals briefed on the matter confirmed this development.\n\nThe specific details of the subpoena remain undisclosed. The Trump Organization, which President Donald Trump ran with his family before entering the White House, has downplayed the significance of any subpoena, with a lawyer stating on Thursday that the company has been cooperative with the special counsel's investigation since July.\n\nMueller is currently investigating Russian attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election and potential collusion by Trump aides. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that it interfered in the election, and President Trump has maintained there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nMueller has already charged several Trump associates and more than a dozen Russians in connection with his investigation.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on the Times report about a subpoena, marking the first known instance of Mueller demanding materials directly related to Trump's businesses.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Thursday in choppy trade, as strong jobs and manufacturing data was counterbalanced by the Times report on Mueller's subpoena.\n\nNew York lawyer Alan Futerfas, who represents the Trump Organization in the Russia probe, stated, \"This is old news, and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.\" Futerfas also represents Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump Organization officers and employees.\n\nCongressional committees are also investigating Russia and the 2016 election, as well as potential collusion with the Trump campaign. The White House declined to comment specifically on the report and referred questions to the Trump Organization.\n\n\"We're going to continue to fully cooperate.

The strikes followed an almost 12-hour pause in fighting and came as international efforts intensified to end the three-week conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe U.N. called for an \"immediate\" cease-fire, with the Security Council issuing a presidential statement urging Israel and Hamas to accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond. The statement also called on the parties to engage in efforts to achieve a durable and fully respected cease-fire, based on the Egyptian initiative.\n\nIsrael's military reported strikes on two rocket launchers and a rocket manufacturing facility in central and northern Gaza after a rocket hit southern Israel early Monday. The rocket caused no damage or injuries. The Israeli military had not carried out any attacks in Gaza since 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, but troops on the ground were continuing efforts to destroy the cross-border tunnels constructed by Hamas for attacks inside Israel.\n\nIn response to the rocket fired at Ashkelon, the military opened artillery fire on Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza. \"Quiet will be met with quiet,\" the office statement said.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has already claimed the lives of 1,030 Palestinians, 43 Israeli soldiers, and three civilians on the Israeli side. The Muslim holiday was marked by fear and mourning instead of holiday cheer in the Gaza Strip, with Palestinian families huddled inside their homes and traditional grave-side gatherings disrupted by airstrikes.\n\nInternational diplomats have expressed concern over the escalating violence and called for a more sustainable truce to end the bloodshed. U.S. President Barack Obama telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his concern over the mounting Palestinian casualties and to push for an immediate, unconditional cease-fire.\n\nThe Israeli government maintains that the operation in Gaza, which began on July 8, was initiated to stop the rocket fire from the coastal territory and to neutralize Hamas cross-border tunnels built for attacks on Israeli territory. The conflict has sparked widespread international condemnation and calls for a peaceful resolution.",

Frazier's decision comes in the wake of President Trump's controversial remarks that placed blame on \"many sides\" for the violence that left one person dead and numerous others injured.\n\nIn a statement, Frazier argued that U.S. leaders must \"clearly reject expressions of hatred, bigotry, and group supremacy.\" He emphasized that America's strength lies in its diversity and the contributions made by individuals of different faiths, races, sexual orientations, and political beliefs.\n\n\"As CEO of Merck, and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\" Frazier stated, without directly mentioning Trump by name.\n\nIn response, President Trump tweeted, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier previously served as the chairman of a commission that investigated the pedophilia scandal at Pennsylvania State University. The commission's report found that Penn State administrators failed to take action to stop Jerry Sandusky, a football coach convicted of sexual abuse.\n\nPresident Trump faced backlash this weekend for his initial response to the Charlottesville violence, which did not directly place blame on white supremacists.

    " Title: Supreme Court Confirmation Process: Dramatic Shift as Christine Blasey Ford Agrees to Testify\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift turn of events, the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh has taken an unexpected turn, with Christine Blasey Ford's decision to come forward and her subsequent agreement to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Monday. This development has transformed a seemingly certain confirmation into a dramatic dilemma.\n\nInitially, when allegations of misconduct from an unnamed accuser surfaced, the Republicans showed no signs of slowing down the confirmation process. However, Ford's emergence and her lawyer's announcement that she is willing to testify created an unstoppable momentum, compelling Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to invite both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify.\n\nWith the addition of Senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins expressing their support for hearings, the initial proposal for a phone interview between Grassley and the nominee now appears unlikely. Kavanaugh, too, has expressed his willingness to testify.\n\nPresident Trump, while praising Kavanaugh, acknowledged the need for a thorough process, stating, \"If it takes a little delay, it'll take a little delay.\"\n\nThe allegations against Kavanaugh, which include sexual assault, are serious and have the potential to traumatize the accuser. On the other hand, if Kavanaugh is innocent, the allegations could unfairly tarnish a man who has built an outstanding career and is widely respected.\n\nFord, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University, has expanded on her account, stating that Kavanaugh groped her, tried to remove her bathing suit, and covered her mouth when she screamed. Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, has said that Ford considers this an attempted rape.\n\nThe Senate, media, and public are now faced with a complex situation. The allegations are severe, and if proven true, could have lasting effects on Ford. However, if Kavanaugh is innocent, the allegations could unfairly damage his reputation. The upcoming hearings will be closely watched as the nation grapples with this complex issue. The outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Agreement Reached on VA Health Care Legislation to Address Scandals and Improve Services for Veterans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant step towards addressing the ongoing issues plaguing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), leaders from the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees unveiled a tentative deal on Monday for legislation aimed at improving veterans' health care and addressing the myriad of scandals within the VA. The proposed bill is expected to authorize at least $17 billion in spending over the next three years to rectify the veterans' health program, with approximately $5 billion of that amount offset elsewhere in the budget.\n\nRep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), who heads the House veterans committee, stated, \"This starts the conversation. The VA is not sacred \u2013 veterans are.\"\n\nThe agreement includes funding to facilitate prompt access to outside care for veterans who are unable to secure appointments with VA doctors, as well as funding to hire doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. The plan also grants the VA secretary the authority to immediately dismiss senior executives, while providing employees with streamlined appeal rights.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate veterans panel, had proposed a bill last week that would cost around $25 billion over three years. In response, Miller presented a plan to approve $10 billion in emergency spending, with a promise of additional spending in future years. The lawmakers' differences nearly derailed negotiations last week, but they negotiated over the weekend and produced the plan announced on Monday.\n\nSen. Sanders commented, \"The United States Congress is, in my view, a dysfunctional institution... so I'm quite proud of what we've accomplished.\"\n\nThe leaders of both parties in both chambers will now need to gauge the sentiment of their respective caucuses on the plan, which still requires approval by the House and Senate. The announcement could alleviate concerns that Congress would recess for five weeks without a legislative solution amidst widespread national outrage over problems within the VA.\n\nIn a joint statement, the lawmakers claimed they had \"made significant progress\" toward an agreement on legislation \"to make VA more accountable and to help the department recruit more doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals.\" The plan includes provisions such as funding for veterans who cannot secure a VA appointment to receive non-VA care, funding for the VA itself, and authority for the VA secretary to immediately dismiss corrupt or incompetent senior executives.\n\nThe VA has been under scrutiny following the revelation that 18 veterans died while on a secret waiting list for care at the VA facility in Phoenix. An inspector general's report in May found that roughly 1,700 veterans in Phoenix were on an unauthorized list, with some waiting as long as 115 days for treatment. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned shortly after the report's release.\n\nLawmakers had been working through dueling proposals last week. These proposals would have scaled back separate House- and Senate-passed bills after lawmakers in both parties expressed shock at price tags totaling more than $35 billion. The Obama administration states that it needs about $17.6 billion to hire thousands of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals, lease new facilities, and upgrade its computers to reduce a backlog of veterans awaiting care at VA hospitals and clinics. The administration's request does not include money to allow more veterans to go to private doctors to avoid long waits for VA care. Expansion of private care was the biggest cost in the bills approved by Congress.\n\nRepublicans criticized Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson's budget request as thinly documented. Miller told Gibson on Thursday that such a large request was made in a slim, three-page memo. The VA request includes $8.2 billion to hire 1,500 doctors and thousands of nurses and other medical and mental health professionals; $6 billion for construction projects to improve safety or patient access; $1.2 billion for computer enhancements; and $400 million for more staff to deal with the agency's backlog of benefits claims.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Compares Trump Administration to Nixon Era, Criticizes Current Political Climate at Wellesley College Commencement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a pointed and critical commencement address at her alma mater, Wellesley College, former First Lady and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton compared the Trump administration to the Nixon era, highlighting several controversies surrounding the current administration.\n\nClinton, who has previously delivered the commencement speech at Wellesley in 1969 and 1992, warned the graduating students that they are \"graduating at a time when there\u2019s a full-fledged assault on truth and reason.\"\n\nWithout directly naming President Trump, Clinton took aim at several issues, including the administration's budget blueprint, which she described as \"an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us \u2014 the youngest, the oldest, the poorest, and hard-working people who need a little help to gain or hang on to a decent, middle-class life.\"\n\nClinton also criticized the Trump administration's handling of certain controversies, drawing parallels to the Nixon presidency, which ended in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice. She discussed the sentiment on campus the year she graduated, stating, \"We were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice, after firing the person running the investigation into him at the Department of Justice.\"\n\nFurthermore, Clinton addressed the ongoing debate about crowd size at Trump's inauguration, referencing White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's claim that it was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" Clinton noted the subsequent media scrutiny and the use of the term \"alternative facts\" by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway to defend the claim.\n\nIn response to Clinton's speech, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel issued a statement, accusing Clinton of \"lashing out with the same partisan talking points\" and suggesting that her comments were a \"stark reminder why (she) lost in 2016.\"\n\nThe speech serves as a reminder of the ongoing political divide in the United States, with Clinton's comments reflecting the criticism and opposition faced by the Trump administration, while also highlighting the concerns and issues that many Americans are grappling with in the current political climate.",
    " Title: Macedonia Launches \"Stop Operation Soros\" Initiative to Counter Global Influence of George Soros\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that echoes similar actions taken by other European countries, the Balkan nation of Macedonia has launched a new initiative called \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) to counter the influence of global billionaire George Soros. The initiative, which calls on \"free-minded citizens\" to join, aims to combat what its founders describe as a monopolization of civil society in Macedonia by Soros-funded non-government organizations.\n\nNikola Srbov, a cofounder of SOS, alleged in a press conference on Tuesday that the Open Society Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, has used its funding and personnel to suppress dissenting views and support violent processes in Macedonia. Srbov claimed that the Open Society Foundation's actions go beyond the principles of civic organizing.\n\nThe Open Society Foundation, established by Soros in the 1980s with the stated goal of helping former Soviet bloc countries transition from communism, has been a subject of controversy in several countries. Critics argue that, in reality, the foundation is used to destabilize governments and foment discontent within countries.\n\nThis is not the first time Soros and his organizations have faced backlash. Earlier this month, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced that the Hungarian government would begin cracking down on any organizations linked to Soros. In December, Orban stated, \"In every country, they will want to displace Soros. In the coming year, Soros and his forces will be squeezed out.\"\n\nIn 2014, Soros openly admitted on CNN that the Open Society Foundation was involved in the violent overthrow of Ukraine's government, which led to Russia banning Soros and his NGOs from the country the following year, citing them as a \"security threat\" to the former Soviet nation.\n\nAs nationalism continues to rise around the world, fueled by President Trump's election, it remains to be seen whether this won't be the last instance a European country kicks out Soros and his associated groups. The development in Macedonia underscores the ongoing debate about the role of global philanthropists in shaping political and social landscapes.",
    " Title: Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton: A Distance in the 2020 Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on \"The View,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stated that he has not sought advice from former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton regarding the 2020 presidential race and has no plans to do so. Sanders' comments come amid reports that Clinton has been meeting with various 2020 hopefuls to offer advice.\n\nWhen asked about potential meetings with Clinton, Sanders responded, \"I suspect not.\" The senator's decision not to seek advice from Clinton is not surprising, given their reported ideological differences.\n\nSanders' entry into the 2020 race marks a return to a crowded and diverse field of Democratic candidates. Sanders' defense of democratic socialism has been a point of contention for allies of President Donald Trump and other conservatives, but he enters the race largely free of the characterizations as an idealistic fringe candidate from the 2016 election.\n\nIn her book, \"What Happened,\" Clinton placed blame on Sanders for contributing to her 2016 loss, arguing that he detracted several would-be voters. The apparent lingering tension between the two was evident in Sanders' Friday interview.\n\n\"Hillary has not called me,\" Sanders said. \"Look, we have differences,\" he continued, before conceding, \"Hillary has played a very important role in modern American politics.\"\n\nDespite the apparent ideological differences, Sanders expressed support for other Democratic candidates, stating his main objective in 2020 is to vote out Trump. Sanders added that he would support any candidate the Democrats choose to do so, provided he is not the nominee.\n\n\"I hope to be the Democratic nominee and have the support of the whole Democratic Party behind me,\" Sanders said. \"If I am not and somebody else is, I will support that candidate because what's most important is that Trump be defeated.\"\n\nSanders campaigned for Clinton in 2016 after losing the party's nomination. As the race for 2020 heats up, it remains to be seen how the relationship between Sanders and Clinton will evolve.",
    " Title: Conservative Scholars Debate Compatibility of Paid Family Leave with Conservative Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 As the 2020 Democratic presidential race heats up, one issue that has gained significant attention is the Family Act, a bill proposed by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand that guarantees twelve weeks of paid family leave for new parents and caregivers. Every Democratic senator running for the 2020 nomination has signed on as a co-sponsor.\n\nHowever, the Republican party has yet to coalesce around a paid-family-leave plan, or even agree on whether paid family leave is a conservative idea in the first place. This debate was the focus of an event on Capitol Hill this week hosted by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, titled \"Is Paid Family Leave Compatible with Conservative Principles?\"\n\nThe event's first panel featured a debate on the title question. Arguing in favor of paid leave were Aparna Mathur, a scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute who directs the AEI\u2013Brookings working group on paid family and medical leave, and Kristin Shapiro of the Independent Women's Forum, who authored the initial policy paper from which GOP politicians have drawn inspiration in crafting their paid-leave bills.\n\nOn the other side, Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center, argued that even Republican proposals for paid leave are fundamentally incompatible with a proper conservative understanding of the federal government's role.\n\nMuch of the opposition from Greszler and de Rugy stemmed from slippery-slope concerns, the belief that, once established, even a limited parental-leave program would eventually be expanded to cover other forms of leave, further increasing the size and scope of the federal government. Their arguments dealt primarily with Shapiro's proposal, now embodied in two slightly different bills sponsored by four GOP senators, to allow new parents to collect some of their Social Security benefits after the birth or adoption of a child and delay collecting those benefits at the time of retirement.\n\n\"Where we don't seem to agree is on the purpose of Social Security, or on Congress's future ability to refrain from expanding what...would start out as a small program with a minimal cost,\" Greszler said. She predicted that the idea would become \"a large-scale, massive program that would cover all types of leave at a very great cost.\"\n\nGreszler noted that there are already proposals to create a similar program allowing young people to borrow from Social Security to repay their student loans, and she warned that this or similar policies could gain traction in the wake of passing a conservative paid-parental-leave bill.\n\nShapiro and Mathur maintained that paid parental leave is popular with most Americans and cautioned that if conservatives refuse to show up to the table with their own proposals, they will be left behind as the public coalesces around the expansive Democratic solution. Shapiro also argued that a conservative plan would be a pro-life policy to help those most in need and reduce infant mortality, filling in the gaps especially for low-income families who don't already have paid leave through their employers.\n\nThe second panel of the morning featured policy advisers from three Senate offices outlining the differences between the two Republican proposals for paid leave. The CRADLE Act, sponsored by Senators Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Mike Lee (Utah), would permit new parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid-leave benefits in exchange for postponing their Social Security benefits for two, four, or six months. The New Parents Act, from Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), similarly would allow new parents to use some of their Social Security benefits to finance up to three months of parental leave but also would allow parents to take benefits even if they were not employed at the time of a child's birth (so long as they had a sufficient earnings history). Parents could choose to finance the benefit either by delaying retirement for three to six months or by reducing the amount of their Social Security benefits for the first five years post-retirement.\n\nRepresentatives Dan Crenshaw (Texas) and Ann Wagner (Mo.) are co-sponsoring the New Parents Act in the House.\n\nCaleb Orr, a policy adviser for Rubio, explained the distinction between the two bills by noting that requiring a set period of leave in order to obtain the benefit\u2014as the Lee-Ernst bill would do\u2014might discourage at least some families or parents from choosing to take leave at all, which would undermine the goal of the policy.\n\n\"The main practical fact that we encounter in requiring leave is that most low-income mothers don't work salaried professions,\" Orr said. \"Requiring leave in a one-month to three-month fashion in a standardized way simply does not match with the reality of low-wage work forces.\" He argued that the Rubio-Romney bill would benefit small-business employees not eligible even for unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as well as those who might work part-time or work from home shortly after the birth of a newborn.\n\nMeanwhile, Jena McNeill and Christy Woodruff, advisers in the offices of Ernst and Lee respectively, emphasized the importance of facilitating time for new parents to bond with and care for a newborn, which wouldn't necessarily happen without the requirement that parents actually take time off work in order to receive the benefit.\n\nSo far, only these four Republican senators have signed on to a particular parental-leave policy, but supporters of the idea point to Ivanka Trump's interest and argue that now is the time for conservatives to gain public support, before Democrats beat them to it.",
    " Title: The Supreme Court Vacancy and the Test of Divided Government: A Challenge for the American Political System\n\nArticle:\n\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia has posed a significant challenge to the American political system, a test that, according to political analysts, it may not pass. The question at hand is whether a divided government can effectively govern in the face of today's more polarized political parties.\n\nIn the past, such as in 1988, a presidential election year, a Democratic Senate unanimously approved President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Despite the election and divided party control of the government, the Senate carried out its duty, demonstrating that divided government could indeed govern.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Scalia's death, senior Republicans have stated that they will not consider an appointment from President Obama, despite his almost year left in office. This stance was most notably expressed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who argued that the vacancy should not be filled until a new president is elected.\n\nThis stance raises questions about the democratic legitimacy of both Obama and McConnell, as the American people had already spoken in the 2012 election, reelecting Obama, and in the 2014 election, electing McConnell as majority leader. The elections, carried out in different years, with different electorates, and using different electoral systems, are equally valid, yet the system carries no mechanism for resolving the resulting confusion.\n\nThis lack of resolution is a common issue in political systems, as noted by the late sociologist Juan Linz. He argued that, aside from the United States and Chile, few other presidential governments have managed to maintain constitutional continuity for a century and a half. Chilean democracy, however, broke down in the 1970s.\n\nLinz attributed the strength of the American political system to its unusual parties, which lacked clear ideological distinction. Both the Democratic and Republican parties contained both conservatives and liberals, making compromise easier. However, in recent decades, our political parties have become sharply distinct, with liberals clustered in the Democratic Party and conservatives in the Republican Party. This level of party polarization is unprecedented in American politics.\n\nThe great unanswered question of American politics in this era is whether our divided political system can function in times of stress. The disagreement between a Democratic president and a Republican House nearly forced the United States to default on its debt in 2011, and it shut down the government in 2013.\n\nNow, we see another form of stress - how a divided political system, where disagreements are sharper than ever, will fill a Supreme Court nomination. As of now, the answer Republicans are giving is simple: it does not. Their hope is that they can keep Obama from nominating a justice, and then they will win the presidency next year and simply make the nomination themselves, no compromise necessary.\n\nHowever, this stance raises concerns about the precedent it sets. If a president's final year in office, which means two of his eight years, is a year in which hard decisions cannot be made and crucial vacancies cannot be filled, it could signal a deterioration in the system's capacity to govern amidst divided party control.\n\nThis is not to predict constitutional collapse over a Supreme Court vacancy. However, if American politics cannot fill a Supreme Court vacancy amidst divided government in any of the 25 percent of years that are presidential election years, then that is proof that our system is deteriorating in its capacity to govern amidst divided party control - that the space for effective governance is narrowing due to party polarization.\n\nDivided government is a common occurrence in American politics. It did not used to signal disaster for the system's ability to solve problems. If it does so now, then the country will, over time, pay a serious price for a political system that no longer fits its political parties.",
    " Title: Trump Urges NATO Nations to Meet Defense Spending Commitments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech before U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, President Trump reiterated his long-standing position that NATO member nations should meet their financial commitments to the alliance.\n\n\"We strongly support NATO; we only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper contributions to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing \u2014 many of them have not been even close,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President's comments come as criticism from some quarters that he is \"against\" NATO, a characterization that the White House has consistently denied. Trump's stance is based on the premise that NATO nations, particularly those in Europe, are not contributing their fair share to the defense of the alliance, with many relying on the United States for military protection.\n\nThe President's remarks echo sentiments expressed in the past, highlighting the disparity in defense spending between the United States and its NATO allies. According to the White House, most NATO countries have military capabilities that are significantly less powerful than the Tampa Police Department, with many European countries preferring to allocate resources towards extensive welfare programs rather than their own defense.\n\nThis issue is not a new one, with the United States having historically shouldered a significant portion of the defense burden for NATO. While the U.S. has drafted millions of young men for military service, many European countries have not had national service requirements. For instance, the British ended national service in 1960, while Germany had it only between 1956 and 2011, for a brief six-month period that was relatively easy to opt out of.\n\nIn the 1960s, when the President was on liberty in various European cities, Europe had been rebuilt and was nearly as prosperous as the U.S. However, it chose to allocate its resources elsewhere, leading to a situation where American service members were defending Europe while European civilians enjoyed the fruits of their prosperity.\n\nPresident Trump's call for NATO nations to meet their defense spending commitments is not a new demand, but a continuation of a long-standing issue that has persisted since the alliance's inception. While European officials who advocate for increased defense spending may face opposition from their constituents, the President's stance is a call for NATO nations to fulfill their obligations and take responsibility for their own defense.\n\nThe President's comments come at a time when the United States is facing budgetary constraints and a need to prioritize its own defense spending. By urging NATO nations to meet their commitments, the President is not only advocating for a more equitable distribution of defense burdens, but also for a more sustainable and secure future for the alliance.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at the Better Care Reconciliation Act: A Market-Based Approach to Healthcare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Better Care Reconciliation Act, the latest health-care bill unveiled by Senate Republicans, has drawn criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. However, a closer examination of the proposal reveals a thoughtful and market-based approach to healthcare that addresses some of the key flaws in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nMany on the right, such as Senator Rand Paul and Americans for Prosperity, have criticized the plan as a watered-down version of ObamaCare. Meanwhile, many liberals have denounced the Better Care Act as an evil plan imposed by heartless Republicans. Both sides, in this case, may be wrong.\n\nThe Better Care Act is more thoughtful than the House's version and not nearly as malign as many Democrats have declared it to be. The bill shares many similarities with the Republican Party's go-to expert on health-care policy, Avik Roy. This is reassuring, given Roy's undisputed expertise in the field.\n\nMany on the left would dispute this, at least in this case. \"No tweaks by amendment can fix this monstrosity,\" tweeted Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. \"If you vote for this evil, intellectually bankrupt bill, it will ruin millions of lives.\" The bill's passage would have sweeping implications, but Republicans could make the same normative claims about ObamaCare itself.\n\nWhile the ACA has helped millions of Americans, it has also left millions uninsured and many more with higher premiums and deductibles than in 2009, when Democrats promised their plan would deliver the opposite. Even now, many Democrats are reluctant to acknowledge that their conservative critics were correct in predicting such problems.\n\nThe left's default position is that ObamaCare's shortcomings are due to Republican obstructionism prior to its passage and Republicans' subsequent refusal to cooperate. However, former President Obama noted that while the ACA represented a significant step forward for America, it was not perfect, nor could it be the end of efforts.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which passed in Congress without a single Republican vote, affirms the premise that we should think about health care as a market good. The ACA's key provisions are about the government's role in regulating, stabilizing, and expanding access to the market we already have, not in replacing it altogether.\n\nThe same is true of the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The GOP's plan genuinely accepts the premise that Obama and the Democrats merely conceded, and seemingly resent. This would explain why some conservatives see the proposal as ObamaCare lite, and Democrats see it as a crime against humanity.\n\nThe Better Care Reconciliation Act is a market-oriented plan that takes seriously the trade-offs involved in such an approach. If you want to remove some bureaucratic hurdles and government largesse from the health-care market, as many conservatives do, then some people will lose coverage, and others will see an increase in their out-of-pocket costs. That's how markets work, even if the architects of ObamaCare refused to believe it.\n\nThe Better Care Act is realistic, not nihilistic. Like ObamaCare, it recognizes that the government can and should play a role in situations where the market, if left to its own devices, has merciless implications. Most significantly, it largely preserves the protections the 2009 law established for Americans with pre-existing conditions, and provides reinsurance for the insurers who might have balked at doing so. That was a humane and worthwhile achievement, which Democrats deserve credit for, even if they are heartless monsters who left millions of Americans uninsured.\n\nIt seems possible, as it stands, that none of this matters. On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released its score of the bill, which found, among other things, that passage of the legislation would result in an additional 22 million Americans being uninsured in 2026, compared to projections based on the current law. The logic underlying this projection was debatable, but its political implications are clear cut. The Democrats who touted ObamaCare as a plan that would make comprehensive health insurance affordable to the average American are out of power, at the time being. But perhaps they will regain control of Congress in 2018. And if so, we can all look forward to seeing them unveil their secret plan.",
    " Title: Huffman Urges Calm on Superdelegate Issue, Emphasizes Party Unity and Importance of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech to constituents in Bayside, California, Representative Jared Huffman (D-CA) called for calm on the issue of superdelegates and emphasized the importance of party unity in the upcoming presidential election. Huffman, a superdelegate who has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, acknowledged his district's likely support for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nHuffman expressed his dislike for the superdelegate system, stating, \"I'd just like to let voters vote and decide who wins and loses.\" He assured his constituents that he would not attempt to \"rig this election as an insider\" and would follow the voters' decisions in the primaries and caucuses.\n\nDuring the speech, Huffman also criticized Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, describing the election season as \"crass,\" \"juvenile,\" and \"depressing.\" He warned of the potential consequences of a Trump presidency, including the impact on the Supreme Court, abortion, campaign finance reform, and climate change.\n\nHuffman also addressed concerns about the Democratic Party's superdelegate system, in which members of Congress and party officials are free to vote for whomever they choose in the primary, regardless of the results of the primary in their state. Currently, Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead in delegates chosen by the electorate, but a wide lead in superdelegates.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Huffman, a ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources and a longtime advocate for the state's politically powerful but controversial environmental interests, criticized the Westlands Water District of the Central Valley for what he called \"bad ideas that are designed to take away our water.\" Last week, Huffman and several other California House Democrats called for congressional hearings into the Central Valley water agency's recent settlement with the federal government over drainage for its farms.\n\nWestlands Water District deputy general manager Johnny Amaral, reached by phone late Saturday night, responded to Huffman's comments, stating, \"There is way more to the Trinity River issue than [Huffman] is letting on.\" Amaral criticized Huffman's call for water releases for salmon, stating that billions of gallons of water are flushed to the ocean while kids' soccer fields go dry up and down the state. Amaral also noted that the food served at the Huffman event came from farmers in the Westlands Water District.",
    " Title: Treasury Inspector General Discloses IRS Probe Known to Obama Administration in 2012\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a significant revelation, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, J. Russell George, testified on Friday that senior Treasury officials were informed in June 2012 about an ongoing investigation into allegations of IRS harassment of tea party groups during the heat of the presidential campaign. This disclosure indicates that Obama administration officials were aware of the probe during the election year.\n\nDuring the hearing, ousted IRS head Steven Miller, who faced intense questioning from Republican lawmakers, acknowledged mistakes in the IRS's targeting of tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. However, Miller maintained that no laws were broken and there was no attempt to cover up the actions.\n\nThe hearing, which was the first of several congressional hearings on the matter, also saw Miller speaking publicly about the controversy for the first time. He expressed contrition for the actions of IRS agents who singled out conservative political groups for additional, often burdensome scrutiny.\n\nHowever, the hearing became contentious when Miller insisted he did not deceive Congress, despite failing to disclose the controversy last year when he was asked about it by lawmakers, even after he had been briefed.\n\nThe administration is currently facing scrutiny for a series of issues that threaten to derail President Barack Obama's second-term agenda. In addition to the IRS case, the administration is being questioned about the September 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, and the government's seizure of Associated Press telephone records as part of a leaks investigation.",
    " Title: Post-Election Analysis: The Republican Party's Struggle to Attract Diverse Voting Blocs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 elections, the Republican Party is grappling with the results, particularly the narrow defeat of House candidate Mia Love in Utah. Love, a black Republican and a symbol of the party's growing diversity, lost to Democrat Jim Matheson by a margin of approximately 1 percentage point.\n\nOne of the key factors in Love's defeat was her performance among minority voting blocs, particularly Hispanics. Love won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote compared to 71 percent for Matheson, a disparity that mirrors the presidential race between Mitt Romney and President Obama. This trend highlights the challenge the Republican Party faces in appealing to minority communities, as their numbers continue to grow in the electorate.\n\nThe Republican Party won a smaller percentage of the Hispanic vote in 2012 compared to George W. Bush's 2004 campaign, with Bush securing 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. Hispanics made up 10 percent of the electorate in 2012, up from 9 percent in 2008.\n\nAnother concern for the Republican Party is their appeal to women voters. The failure of Senate candidates Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, who made controversial remarks about rape and pregnancy, has been a significant setback. Women made up roughly 53 percent of the electorate this cycle, and roughly 55 percent of them voted for Obama.\n\nDemocratic strategist Karen Finney told NBC on Wednesday that some Republicans recognize the problem, but change may take two election cycles. Finney also noted that the comments made by Mourdock and Akin were the \"last straw\" after years of state-level Republicans trying to limit women's reproductive rights.\n\nIn a symbolic move, the House Republican Conference elected Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, the No. 4 position in the chamber. Her election ensures that women will be part of party leadership.\n\nThe Republican National Committee, under the leadership of Reince Priebus, has initiated a full analysis of the 2012 elections, focusing on key voting blocs such as women, younger voters, and Hispanics. The goal is to appear less confrontational and more inclusive to Latinos, while acknowledging that real change could take \"a number of years.\"\n\nThe Republican Party is also showing signs of movement on comprehensive immigration reform. House Speaker John Boehner has urged Obama to come up with a plan, although he did not commit to a plan for full citizenship. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has proposed a plan similar to those being put forward by Democrats, which includes securing the borders, requiring applicants to learn English, and addressing the issue of those already in the country illegally.\n\nThe party is also looking to candidates like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 who could help the party connect with Hispanics, as well as women and young voters. Other potential candidates mentioned include Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.\n\nAs the Republican Party moves forward, it will be crucial for them to address these issues and find ways to appeal to a broader spectrum of the electorate, particularly minority and women voters. The full analysis of the 2012 elections, along with strategic changes in leadership and policy, may be the key to the party's future success.",
    " Title: GOP Tax Cuts Advance Despite Deficit Concerns: A Clash of Priorities in the House Ways and Means Committee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked debate and criticism, the House Ways and Means Committee, controlled by Republicans, has voted to advance hundreds of billions in tax cuts, adding to the deficit in the process. The decision, made on Tuesday, saw the committee approve six tax breaks permanently, at a cost of $310 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe vote was almost entirely along party lines, with Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan, a Democrat, stating, \"To say that Republican action today is hypocritical is a serious understatement. This approach today of Republicans flies smack in the face of fiscal responsibility.\"\n\nHowever, the committee's Republican chairman, Dave Camp, also of Michigan, defended the move, arguing that the tax breaks have been passed year after year without any offsets. \"This bill has been extended, unpaid for, probably 30 times,\" Camp said of a research tax credit. \"I think it's important we extend this... supporting permanency, not a temporary extension.\"\n\nThe six tax breaks, known as \"tax extenders,\" were chosen from a larger group of 55 tax breaks that expired at the end of 2013 and have been waiting for congressional renewal. Among those passed Tuesday were the research and experimentation deduction, the credit that helps small businesses with major equipment costs, and the break for businesses earning rent and interest overseas.\n\nDemocrats are particularly pressing the issue now because they see a conflict between the Republican demands that spending, especially on Democratic priorities like unemployment benefits, be offset while the GOP allows their own priority \u2013 tax cuts \u2013 to add to the deficit.\n\n\"It's a clear double standard, particularly when you hold up unemployment,\" said Chuck Marr, director of tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nHowever, Democrats also have exceptions to pay-for pushes, notably, many Democrats believe that unemployment benefits are emergency spending and do not need to be offset.\n\nWhen asked if that is a double standard from the left, Marr said no. \"Unemployment insurance is a temporary, countercyclical move,\" he replied. \"What Republicans are doing here is pushing for something permanent and unpaid for.\"\n\nRepublicans insist their decision to choose tax cuts over trimming the deficit is nothing new. \"Chairman Camp has the position that extensions of current policy and tax cuts don't have to be paid for,\" said Sarah Swinehart, spokeswoman for Camp. \"Pay-fors are for spending. New spending. That's his position.\"\n\nYet, in Camp's recent sweeping tax reform proposal, he did pay for all the tax cuts he extended. He did that largely by repealing other tax cuts. But that proposal is not going anywhere.\n\nCamp insists that's not a contradiction. His office argues that paying for tax breaks is only possible in a comprehensive revision of the tax system, not when tax breaks are taken one by one as the House is preparing to do now.\n\nThe result: On Tuesday, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee chose their anti-tax crusade over their image as deficit hawks. Next, all Republicans in the House will face a similar choice. Multiple GOP sources tell CNN they expect all six tax credit bills to get votes on the House floor, and leadership is still working out the exact timing.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Lawmakers Unveil Immigration Proposal as Government Funding Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers, evenly split by party, unveiled a proposal on Monday to address the ongoing immigration standoff in Washington, as the White House presented a more conservative plan. The group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, has been working since last fall to find a solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.\n\nThe caucus's proposal bears a resemblance to an offer from a bipartisan Senate group led by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), which was previously rejected by President Donald Trump and declared dead in the Senate by GOP leadership. The White House, meanwhile, unveiled its own proposal last week, offering a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants but containing other immigration changes that have faced instant resistance from the left.\n\nThe Problem Solvers Caucus proposal offers a 10- to 12-year pathway to citizenship for qualifying young undocumented immigrants with a clean criminal record and a history of paying taxes. The border security piece of the deal includes the President's request for $1.6 billion for physical barriers such as walls and fencing, and $1.1 billion for technology and other measures. The bill also appropriates money for drug screening, border access roads, and personnel, and authorizes a study on adding fees to related activities that can then be spent on border security.\n\nTo address the other two \"pillars\" of the White House's demands - ending the diversity lottery and curtailing family migration - the bill would eliminate the diversity visa but create a new merit-based visa for underrepresented countries with education, work, and language requirements. Half of the visas would initially be allocated for allowing recipients of Temporary Protected Status to remain in the US after the Trump administration ended their protections.\n\nThe bill would prevent parents who brought their children illegally to the US from being sponsored for citizenship by those children once they become citizens, but would grant them three-year legal work permits to stay in the US without citizenship. The latest short-term government funding runs out on February 8.\n\nRepublican New York Rep. Tom Reed, who co-chairs the caucus, expressed frustration in a statement, saying, \"I am frustrated that there are so many partisan extremists that are more interested in achieving political victories than in actually solving these important issues.\" Democratic co-chairman New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer added, \"No one got everything they wanted, and that's the reality of governing - and I didn't feel the (DACA recipients) could wait any longer.\"\n\nThe success of the Problem Solvers Caucus proposal remains uncertain, but the bipartisan group has been negotiating for months in the hope that if enough rank-and-file members can show consensus across the aisle, it could gain traction with leadership as a viable option as funding talks continue without success. The proposal offers a counterpoint to hardline bills pushed by more conservative House Republicans.",
    " Title: South Korea's Successful Containment of COVID-19: A Lesson in Learning from History\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a span of a month, South Korea managed to effectively contain the spread of COVID-19, with new daily cases falling from 800 to fewer than 100. This morning, the nation of 51 million reported zero new domestic infections for the third consecutive day. On April 15, the country successfully held a national parliamentary election with the highest turnout in three decades, without triggering another wave.\n\nSouth Korea is not alone in its ability to flatten the curve of daily cases; New Zealand, Australia, and Norway have also achieved similar results. However, South Korea's success is particularly noteworthy due to its density and proximity to China, making the achievement even more impressive.\n\nIn contrast, the United States has faced a tragic outcome. In mid-March, the U.S. and South Korea had the same number of coronavirus-related fatalities\u2014approximately 90. By April, South Korea had lost a total of 85 souls to COVID-19, while the U.S. lost 62,000\u2014an average of 85 deaths every hour. The disparity in deaths, despite the U.S. population being approximately six times larger than South Korea's, underscores the stark difference in the two countries' responses to the pandemic.\n\nComparing the South Korean response with the American tragedy, some commentators have attributed the difference to an ancient culture of collectivism and Confucianism across the Pacific. This observation, however, is not only racially insensitive but also oversimplifies the factors contributing to South Korea's success.\n\nThe truth is that the Korean government and its citizens did something simple, admirable, and all too rare: They suffered from history, and they learned from it. South Korea's COVID-19 policy was forged in the crucible of previous public-health crises. In 2002, the SARS outbreak killed several hundred people in East Asia. In 2009, the H1N1 influenza, which likely originated in Mexico, spread to more than 1 million people globally and killed several hundred South Koreans. From these epidemics, South Korean public-health officials recognized the necessity of early testing and the importance of isolating new patients to prevent secondary infections.\n\nHowever, 2015's Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) created the playbook that the country has used to break the back of COVID-19. The MERS outbreak, which originated in the Arabian Peninsula, infected 186 people in South Korea and resulted in 36 deaths. In response, the South Korean government implemented widespread testing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures, which proved effective in controlling the spread of the disease.\n\nThese experiences have equipped South Korea with the knowledge and resources to respond swiftly and effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's success serves as a reminder that learning from history and adapting to new challenges can lead to positive outcomes, even in the face of a global crisis.",
    " Title: First U.S. Case of Ebola Confirmed: A Comprehensive Look at the U.S. Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Tuesday the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States. The patient, who recently traveled from Liberia, is currently receiving care in a U.S. hospital under strict isolation protocols.\n\nDespite the alarming news, health officials emphasize that there is no evidence of transmission on the patient's flights from Liberia to the United States. The U.S. health system, with its robust infrastructure and dedicated public health professionals, is working diligently to ensure the safety of the community and the nation.\n\nSince the outbreak began in West Africa, the CDC has consulted with state and local health departments on nearly 100 cases involving travelers returning from the affected region with symptoms that could potentially be related to Ebola. Out of these cases, only 14 were considered high-risk, with 13 being tested. Ebola was ruled out in all 13 cases.\n\nThe current case marks the first instance of Ebola diagnosis within the U.S. Healthcare workers are meticulously following infection control measures to care for the patient, who is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom. Close contacts of the patient are being identified and monitored for 21 days, the longest known incubation period for Ebola.\n\nThe CDC has been proactive in its preparations, working closely with local and state health departments to enhance surveillance, laboratory testing capacity, provide infection control recommendations, and deliver guidance for public health investigations.\n\nWhile the CDC cannot guarantee that the U.S. will not see additional cases, they are confident that the right steps are being taken to contain the virus within the United States.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that the primary focus should be on stopping the spread of Ebola in West Africa, the epicenter of the outbreak. The health security of the U.S. and the world depends on controlling the disease at its source. The U.S. remains committed to supporting global efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein Allegedly Discussed Removal of President Trump under 25th Amendment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews for his forthcoming book, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has revived the long-standing debate about discussions within the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the removal of President Donald Trump. McCabe claimed that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in the tumultuous days following the firing of FBI Director James Comey, suggested secretly recording the president and potentially invoking the 25th Amendment.\n\nTrump responded to these allegations on Twitter, calling McCabe a liar and accusing top DOJ and FBI officials of orchestrating an \"illegal and treasonous\" plan. The president's tweet referred to the discussions as the \"illegal and treasonous 'insurance policy'\" in reference to text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, which were widely suspected of referring to aspects of the Russia collusion probe.\n\nMcCabe, however, claimed he \"never actually considered taking [Rosenstein] up on the offer.\" He said he discussed the matter with the FBI's then-general counsel, James A. Baker. Last fall, as reported by Fox News, Baker told lawmakers during a closed-door deposition that McCabe and Page had told him details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments. Baker reportedly told congressional investigators he took the word of McCabe and Page \"seriously.\"\n\nMcCabe told CBS News that \"I think the general counsel had a heart attack\" when he told him of Rosenstein's plan. \"And when he got up off the floor, he said, 'I, I, that's a bridge too far. We're not there yet,'\" McCabe added.\n\nRosenstein has repeatedly denied pursuing or authorizing the recording of the president and also denied McCabe's suggestion that he had broached the idea of invoking the 25th Amendment. The Justice Department echoed both denials in a statement released last week, saying Rosenstein \"was not in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.\"\n\nHowever, McCabe said in the interview, \"Rod raised the [25th Amendment] issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other Cabinet officials might support such an effort.\" He added that he believed Rosenstein was \"counting votes or possible votes\" to remove Trump from office.\n\nFox News reported Sunday that Baker, in his testimony to Congress, provided even more details about the alleged 25th Amendment discussions, saying two Cabinet officials were \"ready to support\" such an effort.",
    " Title: Controversy Surrounds Democratic Lawmakers' Use of Kente Cloth in Police Reform Bill Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, US Democratic lawmakers proposed a bill to reform the police, but the focus of social media commentators was not on the legislation itself, but rather on the sartorial choice of the Democratic representatives: the kente cloth scarves they wore.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and other Democratic lawmakers were draped in kente cloth, a colorful geometric fabric originating from Ghana, during the bill's unveiling. The Congressional Black Caucus, a group that meets to pursue legislative goals around greater equality for black people, provided the kente scarves to the congressmen and women.\n\nKaren Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, explained the significance of the kente cloth to reporters, stating, \"The significance of the kente cloth is our African heritage, and for those of you without that heritage who are acting in solidarity.\" She further added, \"That is the significance of the kente cloth - our origins and respecting our past.\"\n\nModern kente cloth is characterized by intricate geometric designs and rich, bold colors such as yellow, blue, green, red, and orange. The cloth is associated with the Ashanti people in central Ghana and is linked with special occasions, as it is expensive to make. The skills of the finest weavers are reserved for Ashanti royalty, and certain patterns are reserved for the king.\n\nThe Democrats' use of kente cloth has sparked a range of reactions, with some finding humor in the situation, while others view it as an insult to Africans. Kenyan writer Nanjala Nyabola tweeted, \"We are not your props,\" while others in the US have criticized the focus on the cloth as a distraction from the proposed police reforms.\n\nAs the bill aims to make it easier to prosecute officers for misconduct, ban chokeholds, and address racism, it remains unclear whether the Republican-controlled US Senate will support the proposed Justice in Policing Act of 2020. As Mrs. Pelosi unveiled the bill, she read the names of black men and women who have died at the hands of police in recent years.",
    " Title: Canadian Parliament Unanimously Condemns U.S. Officials' Remarks Towards Prime Minister Trudeau, Approves Motion in Support of Steel and Aluminum Industry\n\nThe Canadian House of Commons unanimously condemned President Donald Trump and his administration on Monday for disparaging remarks made towards Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The symbolic move came in response to a series of attacks from Trump and his advisors following the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Canada last weekend.\n\nIn a motion, lawmakers rejected \"disparaging ad hominem statements by U.S. officials which do a disservice to bilateral relations.\" The move was in response to comments made by Peter Navarro, the White House National Trade Council director, who said there is a \"special place in hell\" for any leader who engages in bad faith diplomacy with Trump.\n\nTrump and several of his officials, including Navarro, lashed out at Trudeau following the G-7 summit. Trump refused to sign the G-7 joint agreement after Trudeau criticized Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump officials suggested that Trudeau had double-crossed Trump by criticizing him on television after the summit.\n\nIn a tweet on Saturday, Trump criticized Trudeau, saying, \"PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, \u2018US Tariffs were kind of insulting\u2019 and he \u2018will not be pushed around.\u2019 Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\"\n\nCanadian lawmakers also approved a motion that supports the Canadian steel and aluminum industry, which has been hit hard by Trump's massive tariffs. Trudeau kept a low profile on Monday and was not present in the House of Commons during the parliament's unanimous vote.",
    " Title: Analysis: Primary Challenges to President Trump Likely to Fall Flat, Despite Announcements from Former Representatives\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent announcement by former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh that he will challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 Republican primary has sparked a flurry of media coverage, but a closer look at the historical data suggests that primary challenges to the incumbent president are unlikely to succeed.\n\nSerious primary challenges are rare, with the last sitting president to be denied renomination being Chester Arthur in 1884. The only presidents who faced muscular primary challenges in the modern primary era were all under 75 percent approval with members of their own party: Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and George H.W. Bush in 1992. All three went on to lose the general election.\n\nCurrently, President Trump enjoys overwhelming support among Republicans, with 88 percent of the GOP approving of his job performance in the latest Gallup poll. Even polls that incorporate leaners still give him overwhelming intraparty support, with 82 percent approval. According to a CNN analysis from December, Trump is the most beloved among members of his own party in the last 70 years, only surpassed by Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.\n\nHead-to-head polls of the Republican primary give Trump massive leads over any primary challengers. He leads former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, who was the first notable candidate to jump in the race, by anywhere from 60 to 85 points, and he even leads high-profile hypothetical challengers like Utah Senator Mitt Romney and former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley by up to 80 points.\n\nHowever, the stubborn facts do not appear to be deterring challengers, with former South Carolina Representative Mark Sanford also considering jumping in. But beating Trump may not be their real goal; instead, they may simply be hoping to spur a conversation about the party's direction.\n\nThe three potential challengers - Walsh, Weld, and Sanford - represent different wings of the party. Weld is a socially liberal New England Republican, Sanford is a fiscal hawk in the wonkish ideological mold of former House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Walsh is a former tea partier who shares some of Trump's controversial stances.\n\nIf there is only a limited amount of anti-Trump sentiment in the party to go around, there is the risk that Republican challengers could split that small share into even smaller pieces, rather than eat more into Trump's support. For example, a HarrisX national poll from May, when Trump and Weld were the only notable Republicans in the race, gave Trump a 73-7 lead. But HarrisX's latest national poll, the first to include Walsh, puts Trump at 76 percent, Walsh at 5 percent, and Weld at 3 percent.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is too early to give the primary challengers a final grade, it is unlikely that they will attract as much support as Pat Buchanan did against Bush in 1992, the model for a Level 2 primary challenge. Realistically, the most important takeaway from Walsh's and other primary challengers' campaigns may be the potential for them to siphon off a respectable share of the primary vote, which could bode poorly for Trump's reelection chances.",
    " Title: Former President George H.W. Bush's Peaceful and Emotional Final Moments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant and emotional interview on Fox News Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker shared personal recollections and reflections on the life of the late President George H.W. Bush. The 41st President of the United States passed away on Friday at the age of 94, touching off an outpouring of grief, gratitude, and well-wishes from the American people.\n\nDuring the interview, Baker, who called Bush his best friend, discussed Bush's peaceful final day. \"He had a very gentle and peaceful passing,\" Baker said. \"They made arrangements for all of his children to call in to in effect tell him goodbye. In his last words, the last words George Bush ever said were 'I love you,' and he said those words to 43, his son, former President George W. Bush, who had called in to say 'Dad, I love you, I will see you on the other side,' and President Bush said 'I love you,' and those were his last words.\"\n\nThe New York Times offers additional details on Bush's final hours. According to the report, Bush had been fading in the last few days, had not gotten out of bed, had stopped eating, and was mostly sleeping. For a man who had defied death multiple times over the years, it seemed that the moment might finally be arriving. His longtime friend and former secretary of state, James A. Baker III, arrived at his Houston home on Friday morning to check on him. Mr. Bush suddenly grew alert, his eyes wide open. \"Where are we going, Bake?\" he asked. \"We're going to heaven,\" Mr. Baker answered. \"That's where I want to go,\" Mr. Bush said. Barely 13 hours later, Mr. Bush was dead.\n\nThe former president died in his home in a gated community in Houston, surrounded by several friends, members of his family, doctors, and a minister. As the end neared on Friday night, his son George W. Bush, the former president, who was at his home in Dallas, was put on the speakerphone to say goodbye. He told him that he had been a \"wonderful dad\" and that he loved him.\n\nDeath is an inevitability, so perhaps this is the best way to go: saying final, loving goodbyes to everyone who matters in your life before dying at a ripe old age, after living an incredibly full and consequential life. Bush was a war hero, a Congressman from Texas, US Ambassador to the United Nations, Republican National Committee Chairman, Director of the CIA, Vice President of the United States, and President of the United States.\n\nOutgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that Bush will lie in state at the Capitol rotunda from 7:30 pm this evening through Wednesday morning. The public is invited to pay their respects from Monday, December 3, at 7:30 pm ET until Wednesday, December 5, at 7:00 am ET.\n\nOf all the beautiful tributes to Bush after his death, an editorial cartoon depicting the former president reuniting in heaven with his beloved wife and the daughter they lost at a tragically young age went viral. It brought tears to many eyes.\n\nIn a touching tribute, former President George H.W. Bush wrote a letter to his successor, Bill Clinton, on Inaugural Day 1993. The letter, shared by presidential historian Michael Beschloss, reads, \"My very best wishes go with you as you begin your term as President. I wish you great happiness here. I truly root for your success, not as a partisan but as a fellow American.\"\n\nThe world will remember George H.W. Bush as a statesman, a leader, and a loving father and husband. May he rest in peace.",
    " Title: \"Republican Leadership Embraces Counter-Punch Tactics: A Look at the Kavanaugh Confirmation Process\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, the confirmation process of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has marked a significant shift in the political landscape, with Republican leaders adopting a more assertive approach, a tactic they have learned from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe last few weeks have seen a dramatic unfolding of events during the confirmation process, with Democrats failing to find substantial grounds to disqualify Kavanaugh. Instead, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Diane Feinstein (D-CA), brought forth a leaked letter accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault in 1982, an allegation that could not be corroborated by the accuser's four witnesses. Kavanaugh was confirmed as the 114th associate justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Democratic Party, in an attempt to delay the process post-midterm elections, called for an FBI investigation. However, the investigation concluded within days, with no new evidence emerging. The process was met with criticism, with many viewing it as a national disgrace orchestrated by the left.\n\nThe left's tactics, which included vilifying Kavanaugh, were met with resilience from the nominee. In a historic speech before the judiciary committee, Kavanaugh defended himself and refused to withdraw his nomination, stating that he would not let his name be tarnished for political gain.\n\nHistorically, Republican leadership might have yielded to Democratic demands and withdrawn the nominee. However, this time, Kavanaugh pushed back, asking for a hearing under oath when the accusation arose, a move supported by President Trump.\n\nTrump, a self-described counter-puncher, has been criticized for his strained relationship with the media and his blunt approach to political discourse. However, his style seems to have emboldened Republican leaders, who now appear to understand the value of pushing back against Democratic attacks.\n\nIncidents such as Orrin Hatch (R-UT) brushing off anti-Kavanaugh protestors and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) scolding the media for their bias against Kavanaugh suggest a newfound assertiveness from the Republican side. This shift in approach has been met with praise from right-wing voters, who admire the newfound backbone displayed by Republican leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kavanaugh confirmation process has marked a significant turning point in the political landscape, with Republican leaders adopting a more assertive approach, a tactic they have learned from President Trump. This shift in strategy has resulted in the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a significant victory for the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Nationwide Protesters Converge on Washington for \"Justice for All\" March Against Police Racial Profiling\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A diverse group of protesters, rallying against racial profiling by police, will gather in the nation's capital this Saturday in a bid to prompt federal action. The \"Justice for All\" march, organized by civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton, aims to unite families of victims of police brutality, such as Eric Garner and Michael Brown, whose deaths have sparked nationwide protests.\n\nIn a statement, NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks expressed the march's purpose: \"This march is one of many demonstrations to show Congress, the country, and the world that we will not stand down until systemic change, accountability, and justice in cases of police misconduct are served.\"\n\nThe march will bring together the families of Eric Garner, who died in police custody on Staten Island after being arrested for selling loose cigarettes, and Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Grand juries in both cases declined to indict the white officers involved.\n\nRev. Sharpton posed the question, \"Why are we going to Washington?\" to a crowd gathered to discuss the march. \"Because all over the country we all need to come together and demand this Congress deal with the issues,\" he said. \"That we need laws to protect the citizens in these states from these state grand jurors.\"\n\nThe rally will take place Saturday morning at Freedom Plaza, just a block from the White House. A \u2588\u2588\u2588/Pew Research Center poll found that 57% of Americans believed a New York City grand jury should have indicted police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Garner, who was seen in a cell phone video with his arms around Garner's neck, and could be heard gasping, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThe grand jury's decision in Staten Island led to protests in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Atlanta. On Thursday, congressional aides in Washington walked off their jobs in protest.\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, expressed her support for the upcoming march, stating, \"I am so proud that everybody is doing what they have just do. Keep on doing it but just do it in peace.\" The mother of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by police last month, will also attend the event. In that incident, a 911 caller told dispatchers a gun Tamir was pointing at people outside a recreation center in Cleveland, Ohio, was likely not real. Police said Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shot pellets but resembled a semi-automatic pistol, and did not follow orders to put his hands up.\n\nThe protests, which began in Ferguson, Missouri, were ignited by demonstrations following a grand jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of Brown. In Ferguson, demonstrators burned buildings, looted stores, and smashed police cars. The \"Justice for All\" march aims to continue the call for change and accountability in cases of police brutality and racial profiling.",
    " Title: Democrats and Republicans Clash Over Platform Language on God and Jerusalem as Israel's Capital\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated and contentious floor fight at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, a debate erupted over the restoration of references to God and Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the official party platform. The disagreement, marked by shouts and boos, has sparked controversy and raised questions about unity within the Democratic Party.\n\nImmediately following the vote late Wednesday afternoon, platform committee head and former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland told media outlets that the move was merely a \"clarification\" and not an \"error.\" However, President Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter contradicted this in an interview Thursday with media outlets, explaining that Obama personally intervened to restore those references.\n\n\"They were a mistake and he said we've got to fix it,\" Cutter said. \"President Obama did not agree with the platform. He sought to change it.\"\n\nRashida Tlaib, a member of the Michigan delegation and the state's House of Representatives, told media outlets that delegates had been \"shammed\" because it was clear the party did not have the votes to change back the language. Tlaib called it \"irresponsible\" and \"wrong.\"\n\n\"It failed twice, and for whatever reason it still failed but was still pushed through,\" Tlaib said, referring to the three votes that were called during the brief but chaotic procedural move.\n\nThe visual from the floor Wednesday afternoon - of delegates shouting down the convention chairman as he called the vote to restore those references - is sure to prove ready fodder for Republicans looking to cast Democrats as hostile to religion and/or Israel.\n\nRepublicans also used the scene to mock claims that the party is \"unified.\"\n\n\"After yesterday's convention floor fight over Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the mention of God in the platform, it's pretty hard to call this 'a unified party,'\" the Romney campaign said in an email Thursday.\n\nA large and loud group of delegates shouted \"no\" Wednesday as the convention chairman, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, called for the vote. After he concluded the vote on the third try, many booed at his decision.\n\nRep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., pushed to restore the Jerusalem language.\n\n\"I wanted a change (back). I talked to several people close to the president,\" Levin said, without saying whether he spoke to the president. \"The '08 platform stated (the policy) correctly...that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel.\"\n\nThe battle marked the biggest platform fight so far in either party's convention, and signaled Democrats were worried the prior language could have been politically damaging in a tight election year.\n\nIn the section referencing God, the change effectively restored language that had been in the 2008 platform. It now says: \"We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values and interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential.\"\n\nThe initial 2012 platform language said this: \"We gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth - the simple principle that in America, hard work should pay off, responsibility should be rewarded, and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us.\"\n\nThe change came after both Mitt Romney and GOP running mate Paul Ryan criticized the omission. In an interview with media outlets, Romney said the omission signaled the \"party is veering further and further away into an extreme wing that Americans do not recognize.\"\n\n\"(That) this party purposely removed God from their platform suggests a party that is increasingly out of touch with the mainstream of the American people,\" Romney said. \"I see it as being as out of touch and detached.\"\n\nDemocrats also restored a section, previously left out, that states Jerusalem \"is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.\"\n\nThat is what officials say is Obama's personal stance, though the administration's stance is for the status to be worked out between the Israelis and Palestinians.",
    " Title: Trump and Obama Engage in Economic Policy Debate on Twitter\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Presidents' Day, former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump engaged in a debate over economic policy achievements.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Obama tweeted, \"Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history.\"\n\nIn response, President Trump accused his predecessor of attempting to claim credit for his economic achievements.\n\n\"Did you hear the latest con job?\" the president tweeted. \"President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing.\"\n\nThe president continued, \"NOW, best jobs numbers ever, Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) & military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\"\n\nThe Trump campaign also issued a statement criticizing Mr. Obama's tweet, stating that Mr. Trump \"reversed the floundering Obama/Biden economy\" following \"the worst economic recovery in modern history.\"\n\n\"By contrast, though, deregulating, lowering taxes, and supporting free-market policies, President Trump has created the hottest economy on record, with unemployment hitting generational lows and all-time lows for African Americans, Hispanics, the disabled, veterans, and many other hard-working Americans,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, as reported by Fox News.\n\n\"Paychecks are growing at the fastest pace in a decade and twice as fast for low- and middle-income Americans,\" she continued. \"It's no wonder Democrats seek to take credit for the Trump economy after eight years of betraying blue-collar workers and inflicting pain upon the middle class as Americans everywhere suffered.

    " Title: Senate Democrats Approve Budget, but Slim Margin Reveals Fissures in Party Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night session that extended well past midnight, the U.S. Senate approved a Democratic budget for the first time in four years, albeit with a narrow 50-49 vote. The approval process, which involved a marathon 'vote-a-rama' session, exposed internal divisions within the Democratic party as some lawmakers facing re-election distanced themselves from the proposal due to its failure to address the deficit.\n\nThe defections, while minimal, could pose challenges for Democratic leaders as they engage in negotiations with House Republicans. Moderate members may pressure leaders to pursue more aggressive deficit reduction measures, even if they are reluctant to make significant changes to entitlement programs, as suggested by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI).\n\nSen. Mark Begich (D-AK), a moderate Democrat, was among those who opposed the Senate's budget plan due to its substantial deficit. \"While I am glad that Congress is finally addressing our fiscal crisis, this budget did not go far enough,\" Begich stated. \"Alaskans expect us to tackle this staggering deficit and make it manageable. Passing this problem onto our children is not an option.\"\n\nThe House Republican budget, on the other hand, aims to eliminate deficits over the next ten years, although this is largely on paper. The Senate Democrats' budget falls short of this goal, despite raising taxes by $1 trillion. Under the Senate Democrats' plan, the deficit over the next decade would never dip below $400 billion and would hover at or near $600 billion by 2023, adding $7.3 trillion to the national debt over that period, as noted by Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe four Senate Democrats who voted against the Democratic bill were Kay Hagan (D-NC), Max Baucus (D-MT), Mark Pryor (D-AR), and Begich. However, more Democrats may face re-election challenges in moderate-to-conservative states, where a vote for a deficit-heavy budget could pose campaign difficulties.\n\nPresident Obama is set to release his 2014 budget next month, an event that will be closely watched for signs of his willingness to engage in negotiations with Republicans or adopt a more confrontational approach. The Democratic budget includes $975 billion in new taxes, matched by an equal amount of spending reductions, primarily from health programs, defense, and reduced interest payments as deficits decrease more than previously anticipated.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican plans are unlikely to pass in their current forms, and each serves as a blueprint rather than an appropriations bill. Democrats and Republicans will now enter into hard bargaining, making sacrifices if they are to agree on a genuine budget rather than continuing to pass stopgap spending bills to fund the government year after year.\n\nThe White House reiterated its displeasure with the House Republican plan, which does not call for tax increases for anyone. \"The House Republican budget refuses to ask for a single dime of deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected but instead makes deep cuts to education and manufacturing while asking seniors and the middle class to pay more,\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. He emphasized that the Senate plan would \"create jobs and cut the deficit in a balanced way.\" Carney called for Congress to \"come together to find common ground.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA), who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, expressed optimism about bridging the divide between the two parties. \"We have presented very different visions for how our country should work and who it should work for,\" Murray said. \"But I am hopeful that we can bridge this divide.\"",
    " Title: Apple Challenges Federal Court Order to Assist FBI in Breaking into Encrypted iPhone\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, technology giant Apple has announced its intention to contest a federal magistrate's order to help the U.S. government access data from an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters involved in the deadly San Bernardino terror attack in December 2015.\n\nIn a statement published on Apple's website, CEO Tim Cook expressed concerns about the implications of the order, stating that it has far-reaching consequences beyond the legal case at hand. Cook's statement read, \"We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. However, up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.\"\n\nThe order, issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, represents a significant victory for the Justice Department in a technology policy debate that pits digital privacy against national security interests. In response to the order, a federal agent involved in the San Bernardino terror investigation told Fox News, \"Nobody can build a phone that we can't get into under unique circumstances. Why should Apple be allowed to build a phone that does that?\"\n\nThe agent further explained that the information needed is on the phone and cannot be accessed by the phone's carrier, Verizon. The FBI Director, James Comey, had previously expressed concerns about encryption, stating that law enforcement often finds a device that cannot be opened even when a judge has issued a search warrant.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday is linked to the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were responsible for the December 2 shooting at a holiday luncheon for Farook's co-workers. The couple later died in a gun battle with police.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued in Tuesday's court proceeding that investigators cannot access a work phone used by Farook because they do not know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated. Under U.S. law, a work phone is generally the property of the person's employer. The judge told Apple to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order, suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work.\n\nIn his statement, Cook said, \"This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.\" Apple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. Previously, the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government.\n\nThe ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature, which erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nIt remains unclear what investigators believe they might find on Farook's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers, such as Google or Facebook. The couple took pains to physically destroy two personally owned cellphones, and a hard drive from their computer has not been found despite investigators diving for days for potential electronic evidence in a nearby lake.\n\nFarook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack. It was discovered after a subsequent search. It was not known whether Farook forgot about the iPhone or did not care whether investigators found it. The phone was running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, which requires a passcode and cannot be accessed by Apple, unlike earlier operating systems or older phone models. San Bernardino County provided Farook with an iPhone configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup.\n\nThe judge did not spell out her rationale in her three-page order, but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Investigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik's timeline from December 2. Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group; Malik's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group's leader around the time of the attack.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Trump and Clinton Respond Differently to Orlando Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The responses of presumptive U.S. presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history were a study in contrasts, as the two candidates grapple with the nation's fear of terrorism, gun violence, and their often-intersecting realms.\n\nThe motive behind Sunday's early morning rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando remained unknown as Trump and Clinton began weighing in. By day's end, authorities were still investigating what led Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American citizen from Florida, to open fire, killing 50 people and critically wounding dozens more.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to express his condolences, writing, \"When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?\" He later tweeted, \"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.\" After President Barack Obama did not use that same phrase to describe Mateen in his remarks from the White House, Trump released a statement saying the president \"should step down.\"\n\nClinton, who is more schooled in the political customs of responding to tragedies from her years as a senator and secretary of state, was careful in her initial comments. The presumptive Democratic nominee also made her first remarks on Twitter early Sunday, writing, \"As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.\"\n\nClinton and Obama postponed plans to campaign together Wednesday in Wisconsin, a decision driven by both political appearances and an expectation the president would need to spend his week overseeing the government's response to the shooting. Clinton, however, planned to continue with solo campaign stops Monday in Ohio and Tuesday in Pennsylvania.\n\nClinton didn't avoid the prospect of a link to international terrorism in her statement, though she was vague in her language. She has made stricter gun control legislation a centerpiece of her presidential campaign and was more direct in raising the shooting as an example of the nation's failure to keep guns \"out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.\" Federal authorities said later Sunday that Mateen purchased at least two firearms legally within the last week or so.\n\nWhether the tragedy in Orlando ultimately sways the trajectory of the general election campaign is unknown. If current trends hold, there will be more deadly mass shootings in the U.S. before voters head to the polls in November. Other unforeseen events will likely also shape the race over the next five months, as the 2008 economic collapse did in the closing weeks of that year's presidential campaign.\n\nBut as voters begin seriously weighing Clinton and Trump as their next commander in chief, Sunday's shooting left little doubt that the choice between the two candidates is stark.",
    " Title: Obama Expresses Optimism on Immigration Reform, Dismisses Guest Worker Debate as Non-Threatening\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews with Telemundo and Univision, U.S. President Barack Obama expressed optimism about the upcoming immigration reform, stating that a bill could be introduced on the Senate floor as early as next month.\n\nDuring the interviews, which were conducted in English and aired in dubbed Spanish, Obama expressed confidence that a group of lawmakers are close to finalizing the details of their proposal. He told Telemundo, \"I'm actually very optimistic that when they return in early April we will see a bill ready to move through the process.\"\n\nIn his interview with Univision, Obama made a similar statement, saying, \"My sense is that they are close. My expectation is we'll see a bill on the floor of the Senate next month.\"\n\nThe president's comments come as part of his latest push to ignite congressional movement on immigration reform. If a bill is introduced next month, Obama told Telemundo he was \"confident we can get it done certainly before the end of the summer.\"\n\nHowever, there is still a key issue that needs to be resolved: the construction of a guest worker program for the future. According to a source, the eight senators who released the framework for their plan in January are confident they will be ready to unveil the highly anticipated immigration bill early in the week of April 8, when Congress returns to work.\n\nThe president also addressed the concern that the debate over guest workers could derail reform efforts. \"I disagree that it's threatening to doom the legislation,\" he said. \"I think there is commitment among this group of Democratic and Republican senators to get this done.\"\n\nIn addition to discussing immigration reform, Obama also spoke about his upcoming trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. He told Telemundo, \"I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit Mexico. I'm going to be there in early May.\" He emphasized that the relationship between the U.S. and Latin American countries is not just about borders or drug cartels, but also commerce, trade, and energy.",
    " Title: Rep. Eric Swalwell Continues to Pursue Russian Collusion Claims Despite Mueller Report\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC, Representative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) reiterated his belief in the Russian collusion narrative, despite the debunked nature of the Steele dossier and the recent release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. Swalwell's assertions were met with skepticism, with Fox News host Martha MacCallum questioning the validity of his claims.\n\nDuring the interview, Swalwell was asked to respond to a Trump re-election campaign memo that challenged guests who have in the past claimed there was proof of collusion. Swalwell, who is a potential 2020 candidate, stated that he stands by his previous assertions of seeing evidence of collusion and that if President Trump has a problem with that, he can sue him.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes (R-CA), who was chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was on Fox after Swalwell's interview, where he criticized Swalwell's continued focus on the Russian collusion issue. Nunes suggested that Swalwell should have used his interview to discuss other important matters, rather than continuing to push a narrative that has been largely debunked.\n\nThe Russian collusion narrative has been a contentious issue in American politics for several years, with over 2,500 subpoenas issued and 500 witnesses interviewed. However, the Mueller report concluded that there was no collusion between members of Trump's campaign and the Kremlin. Despite this, Swalwell and other Democrats continue to push the narrative, leading to criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nIn a separate interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, Swalwell still expressed the belief that President Trump is a Russian agent. This assertion was met with further skepticism, as the Mueller report did not find evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe continued focus on the Russian collusion narrative, despite the lack of evidence, has led to criticism that Democrats are clinging to a dead horse and ignoring the facts. The Mueller report's summary has all but torpedoed the credibility of the Steele dossier, which was a key piece of evidence in the Russian collusion narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, Rep. Eric Swalwell's continued pursuit of the Russian collusion narrative, despite the lack of evidence and the debunking of the Steele dossier, has led to criticism from both sides of the aisle. The Mueller report's conclusion that there was no collusion between members of Trump's campaign and the Kremlin has cast doubt on the validity of the Russian collusion narrative, and has led to calls for Democrats to move on from this issue and focus on other important matters.",
    " Title: Ann Coulter's Criticism of President Trump's Border Wall Promise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, conservative commentator and early supporter of President Donald Trump, Ann Coulter, has expressed her disapproval of the President's handling of his signature campaign promise, the border wall. Coulter, who authored the book \"In Trump We Trust\" and whose work influenced the Trump campaign's immigration policy, has indicated that she may not vote for Trump's reelection in 2020 if the wall is not built.\n\nDuring a podcast interview, Coulter criticized the President's recent shift in rhetoric regarding the border wall, stating that the White House's willingness to negotiate for funding elsewhere, rather than demanding $5 billion in direct funding, is akin to the \"Wimpy Rule\" - a promise of future action in exchange for immediate concessions.\n\nCoulter's criticism comes as the President's promise of a border wall, a key component of his 2016 campaign, seems to be faltering. Despite the President's unequivocal demand for $5 billion for wall construction last week in negotiations with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has suggested a willingness to compromise on the issue.\n\nCoulter's stance is significant, as she was a vocal and early supporter of Trump's candidacy. She warned that without a wall, Trump's presidency would be \"a joke presidency who scammed the American people, amused the populists for a while, but he'll have no legacy whatsoever.\"\n\nThis development serves as a potential wake-up call for the White House, as it highlights the importance of fulfilling campaign promises, particularly those that resonated strongly with the electorate. The border wall was a key issue for many Trump supporters, and its failure to materialize could impact the President's reelection prospects.\n\nAs we approach the two-year mark of the Trump administration, the border wall remains unbuilt, and the clock is ticking as Democrats prepare to take control of the House, effectively eliminating any near-term funding prospects. If the White House does not make the border wall a priority, it seems unlikely that the project will move forward. And, as Coulter suggests, if the wall is not built, Trump may not receive a second chance to fulfill this promise.",
    " Title: Migrant Caravan Reaches US-Mexico Border, Faces Processing Delays\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of approximately 150 migrants, many traveling with children, seeking asylum in the United States have been halted at the border near San Diego, California. U.S. border officials stated that the Mexico-US border crossing was at capacity, leaving the group's future uncertain.\n\nThe caravan, which originated in southern Mexico on March 25 and numbered over 1,000 people during its 2,000-mile journey, is a topic of ongoing debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic lawmakers. President Trump has frequently criticized the caravan on Twitter, citing it as evidence of the need for stricter immigration laws.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan stated, \"We have reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry.\" CBP officials allowed some members to cross a long bridge leading to US processing buildings but stopped them outside.\n\nLawyer Nicole Ramos expressed disbelief that inspectors at the border were not prepared to process the refugees, stating, \"We can build a base in Iraq in under a week. We can't process 200 refugees.\"\n\nDespite the setback, the migrants, primarily from Honduras, decided to camp out overnight near the processing center. Irineo Mujica, director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the campaign group that organized the caravan, said, \"We've been waiting so long that it doesn't really matter whether it's today, tomorrow, or when they let us in.\"\n\nUnder U.S. immigration law, inspectors have the power to quickly deport individuals lacking proper travel or visa documents at the time of entry or if they believe the person has committed fraud or misrepresented the truth. However, if an individual expresses a fear of return to their home country, they will not be immediately deported but instead be detained until they undergo a \"credible fear interview.\"\n\nThe aim of the interview is for the asylum officer to try to establish if the asylum request is based on a fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, or membership in a particular group. If the officer finds that the individual has a chance of proving fear of persecution, the applicant is referred to a judge.\n\nPresident Trump has made building a wall along the Mexican border a signature campaign promise, but the plan to erect a new physical barrier has been thwarted by lawmakers and appears to have stalled. A major government spending bill, which Trump signed last month, included $1.2bn for the border wall - far short of the $25bn the White House sought. Most of the funding can only be used to repair existing sections of the border, not to build new segments.\n\nThe patience of the many children among the migrants was striking, although perhaps weariness was the real explanation. One little girl stood quietly as a woman fixed the child's hair for an interview that could determine the direction of her life. A small boy in an oversized checked coat sucked his fingers and gazed around at the crowd as he sat on a man's shoulders.\n\nPresident Trump has stated that these families pose a threat to the United States, while the migrants insist they are fleeing danger, not bringing it with them. The future of the migrant caravan remains uncertain as they await processing at the US-Mexico border.",
    " Title: Internal Strife and Criticism Surface in Trump Campaign After First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, a wave of criticism and self-reflection has swept through the Trump campaign. According to multiple sources, the campaign team is planning to intensify their preparations for the next debate, with concerns about the candidate's focus and objectives during the Hofstra debate.\n\nSources within the campaign have expressed frustration and disappointment over Trump's performance, with some describing his demeanor as erratic, impatient, and subdued. Seven campaign aides and advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, voiced their concerns about Trump's strategy and execution during the debate.\n\nThe campaign's internal critique echoes the criticism from outside the campaign, with many conservative commentators and the general public viewing Clinton as the winner of the debate. However, Trump's supporters remain loyal, praising his performance against a formidable opponent like Clinton without committing a major gaffe.\n\nThe New York Times reported that some advisers are attempting to blame Trump for the perceived missteps during the debate, a move that has been met with criticism for its anonymity. This has led to speculation that the advisers are using the press to send a message to Trump, urging him to change his approach for the second debate in St. Louis.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been known for its unconventional approach, with the \"let Trump be Trump\" strategy during the primaries. The internal strife and criticism that have surfaced in the aftermath of the first debate are reminiscent of the shake-up that occurred during the primaries, when Paul Manafort was replaced by Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe campaign's internal struggles come at a time when Trump is in a competitive race against Clinton. Despite the criticism, Trump's supporters remain steadfast, viewing him as a political outsider who can shake up the system. The burden, however, ultimately falls on Trump himself to find a way to win.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign is also dealing with other distractions, such as former Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean's ludicrous suggestion that Trump might have a cocaine problem. The controversy surrounding Dean's comments has led to calls for an apology, while a former Chris Christie ally, David Wildstein, has testified that the governor laughed when he told him the George Washington Bridge lanes were being closed as an act of political retaliation. The truth of Wildstein's testimony remains to be seen, but the potential implications for a Trump-Christie ticket are a cause for concern.",
    " Title: California Golf Course Employs Water-Saving Measures Amid Drought, Saves 50 Million Gallons Annually\n\nIn the midst of California's record drought, The Resort At Pelican Hill in Newport Coast, just south of Los Angeles, is keeping its greens green while conserving water. The golf course, a $6 billion industry in the state that employs nearly 130,000 workers, according to the California Golf Course Owners Association, is saving every drop it can.\n\nStephen Friedlander, vice president of golf at Pelican Hill, emphasizes the course's water-saving efforts. \"When people say, 'Well, that golf course is watering their grass,' if they are talking about Pelican Hill, yes we are, and we're using reclaimed water. And we're using reclaimed water in a very specific, measured way,\" he says.\n\nThe course's water conservation strategies include using warm-season Bermuda grass, which requires less water and grows slower, in most of the 10-acre practice facility. In non-playing areas, the course uses native bushes that require no water. Despite the course's luxury and fancy image, Friedlander assures that players paying over $300 for a round should not notice any differences in the greens and fairways. The key is the irrigation system, which allows course managers to monitor and control irrigation from their smartphones.\n\nPelican Hill saves 50 million gallons of water each year, all recycled water. The course also captures rainwater, which is cheaper and of high quality, according to Sat Tamaribuchi, who designed the course's conservation system. Rainwater collected from buildings, pavement, and cart paths goes into course reservoirs, which form the major water features on the course. Underground, there are giant cisterns that hold millions of gallons of runoff water from the course.\n\n\"As it turns out, because our cistern system and the lake systems are so large, ever since the work was done, no stormwater has left the golf course, essentially,\" Tamaribuchi says.\n\nSteve Friedlander acknowledges that a golf course in a wealthy town like Newport Coast has a real incentive to save water, but he argues that water conservation is not just a California problem. \"If you're in the golf industry and you're not a water quality and a management person, then what are you doing?\" Friedlander asks. This perspective suggests that golfers should not feel guilty about playing golf, at least not in terms of water consumption.",
    " Title: Justice Ginsburg's Health Status Sparks Speculation Amidst Retirement Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a prominent figure in the Supreme Court and a champion of women's rights, has been in the limelight recently due to her health and potential retirement. Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg, known for her Brooklyn accent and lifelong advocacy for gender equality, has gained significant popularity in recent years, earning the nickname \"Notorious R.B.G.\"\n\nIn the past, during the Obama administration, there were calls for Ginsburg to step down to allow for a new appointment by the president. However, these discussions did not materialize, and the Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, preventing them from confirming a new justice.\n\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 led to a standoff between the Obama administration and the Republican-led Senate, as Obama nominated Merrick B. Garland, a centrist appellate judge, to replace Scalia, but the Senate refused to consider the nomination. President Trump later appointed Neil M. Gorsuch to the court, maintaining the 5-to-4 conservative-liberal split.\n\nIn 2013, Ginsburg stated that she would not base her retirement plans on the occupant of the Oval Office. She expressed her intention to remain on the court \"as long as I can do the job full steam.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, another critical swing vote, announced his retirement. His replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, was confirmed in a contentious process, marking one of the closest Senate votes since the 19th century.\n\nAs of Thursday, the Supreme Court's press office and a hospital spokeswoman have declined to comment on Justice Ginsburg's condition, sparking speculation about her retirement and the potential impact on the court's balance.",
    " Title: GOP Elites Maintain Support for Trump Despite Leaked Audio of Sexual Assault Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of leaked audio revealing Donald Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women, several Republican elites have expressed outrage, but have yet to withdraw their endorsements.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among others, have condemned Trump's comments, describing them as repugnant and unacceptable. However, they have not retracted their support for the presidential nominee.\n\nThe leaked audio, in which Trump is heard saying, \"grab them by the pussy,\" has sparked widespread criticism, particularly given Trump's long history of making misogynistic comments. This history includes recent insults directed at Rosie O' Donnell and former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, as well as his defense of past sexist remarks.\n\nDespite this history, the refusal of Republican elites to withdraw their endorsements is not entirely surprising, given Trump's track record in the campaign. He has made numerous controversial comments, including characterizing Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and \"bringing crime\" and \"drugs\" to the US, suggesting that Sen. John McCain was not a war hero, and proposing a ban on an entire religious group entering the US.\n\nTrump has also encouraged violence at his campaign rallies, feuded publicly with the parents of a fallen military veteran, and made racist and bigoted comments, such as calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahontas\" to denigrate her claimed Native American heritage and arguing that a judge's Mexican heritage was reason enough to kick him off a court case.\n\nGiven Trump's history of divisive and offensive comments, the continued support of GOP elites is not unexpected. It raises questions about the party's tolerance for such behavior and the potential for Trump to become the next President of the United States.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Resurgence of COVID-19, Cases Spike Across South and West\n\nA new wave of COVID-19 infections is sweeping across the United States, with cases surging in several states, particularly in the South and West. The U.S. recorded a one-day total of 34,700 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest level since late April, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn Texas, which began lifting its shutdowns on May 1, hospitalizations have doubled and new cases have tripled in two weeks. California reported over 7,100 new cases, and Florida's single-day count surged to 5,500, a 25% jump from the record set last week. Several other states, including Arizona, Nevada, Mississippi, and Oklahoma, also set single-day records this week.\n\nHospital administrators and health experts are warning that the current situation is a result of a combination of a tired-of-being-cooped-up public and politicians not taking sufficient measures to control the spread of the virus.\n\n\"People got complacent,\" said Dr. Marc Boom, CEO of the Houston Methodist hospital system. \"And it's coming back and biting us, quite frankly.\"\n\nThe virus has been blamed for over 120,000 U.S. deaths\u2014the highest toll in the world\u2014and more than 2.3 million confirmed infections nationwide. On Wednesday, the widely cited University of Washington computer model of the outbreak projected nearly 180,000 deaths by Oct. 1.\n\nIn Texas, intensive care units are nearly full, and two public hospitals are running at capacity, according to Mayor Sylvester Turner. In Arizona, emergency rooms are seeing about 1,200 suspected COVID-19 patients a day, compared with around 500 a month ago.\n\nHealth experts are urging states to impose new restrictions on businesses to prevent hospitals from exceeding capacity. Dr. Joseph Gerald, a University of Arizona public health policy professor, said Arizona is in \"deep trouble\" and hospitals will probably exceed capacity within the next several weeks if trends continue.\n\n\"We are in deep trouble,\" said Gerald, urging the state to impose new restrictions on businesses, which Gov.

China appears to have tamed a new outbreak in Beijing, again demonstrating its ability to mobilize vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days.\n\nWorldwide, over 9.4 million people have been confirmed infected, and nearly 500,000 have died, by Johns Hopkins' count.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Investigation and the Question of Trump's Fitness for Office\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the denial of collusion by President Donald Trump has become as predictable as a classic rock anthem at a Trump rally. Amidst the backdrop of recent legal developments, Trump's denial of collusion with Russia, a charge that has become almost ancillary, still echoes through his rallies.\n\nLast week, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to a series of crimes, including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. During his hearing, Cohen admitted to making six-figure payments to silence women during the 2016 election at Trump's behest, and he claimed Trump ordered him to circumvent the campaign-finance reporting system to make these payments. The same day, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges.\n\nDespite these developments, Trump maintains his denial of collusion, a charge that, if proven, would require special counsel Robert Mueller to establish Trump's knowledge of a meeting between Trump surrogates and Russian representatives that took place in Trump Tower before the election. The specifics of what Trump knew and when he knew it remain somewhat cryptic, but the evidence of Trump's unfit behavior is abundant.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Trump's behavior is his propensity to lie. From his false statements about his involvement in Donald Trump Jr.'s statement regarding the Trump Tower meeting to his denial of knowledge of the payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump's dishonesty has been a recurring theme since he took office. His bullying and harassment of law enforcement officials, his undermining of the investigation on Twitter, and his preference for the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence are further examples of his untrustworthiness.\n\nThe irony lies in the fact that, while Trump may not have colluded with Russia, the evidence against him in terms of his behavior since the investigations began has lent more and more credence to the possibility of his guilt. As Mark Twain once said, \"In what way has the president set a high example?\" The question remains unanswered, and the real scandal may not be collusion, but rather the actions and behavior of Donald Trump himself.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes $850 Billion Stimulus Package to Ease Economic Impact of Coronavirus\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced plans to seek Congress' approval for an $850 billion emergency stimulus package to mitigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus. A senior administration official confirmed the proposal on Tuesday, emphasizing that it is a tax proposal, not a spending stimulus as proposed by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY).\n\nThe proposal, first reported by The Washington Post, is expected to include a payroll tax cut and approximately $50 billion to aid the airline industry. President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also suggested sending direct payments to Americans as part of the proposal.\n\nTrump and Mnuchin indicated a payroll tax cut is still under consideration, but they are exploring other methods to expedite financial assistance to Americans. Mnuchin aims to distribute the one-time payments to Americans within the next two weeks, though the exact amount remains undisclosed.\n\n\"We're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,\" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe president has advocated for a payroll tax cut as a means to support those experiencing economic hardships due to the virus. On Monday, Trump stated his administration would fully support the airlines and would \"very strongly\" consider the industry's request for $50 billion in assistance.\n\nMnuchin is set to present the stimulus package to Senate Republicans on Tuesday. The proposal is also expected to include payments to small businesses and loan guarantees to specific industries, such as airlines and hotels.\n\nMeanwhile, Schumer is expected to reveal a proposal outlining $750 billion in spending to address the economic consequences of the virus.\n\nIf approved, the stimulus package would mark the third legislative action taken by Congress to address the economic impact of the virus, which has affected more than 4,000 people in the United States, caused significant stock market volatility, and led to widespread school, business, and other closures across the country.\n\nThe news of the proposal follows the House's passage of a comprehensive package aimed at assisting American families affected by the virus, which received support from President Trump.",
    " Title: Educator Expresses Concern Over Political Obstruction and Its Impact on Students' Perception of Government\n\nArticle:\n\nMaria Mueller, an Advanced Placement U.S. Government teacher in the Mason City Schools District, emphasizes the importance of her students observing the Constitution in action, rather than just reading about it in textbooks. She believes that witnessing the checks and balances established by the Founding Fathers is a valuable learning experience.\n\nRecently, the confirmation process of a Supreme Court justice has been in the spotlight, with Senator Rob Portman meeting with Merrick Garland, but subsequently announcing his intention to block a vote on the nominee. This political maneuver is a stark example of the confirmation process, one that Mueller hopes her students will soon have the opportunity to observe and appreciate.\n\nIn her classroom, Mueller strives to instill the values of Aristotle, who believed that politics is the noblest endeavor, fostering self-knowledge and encouraging relationship-building. However, in today's politically polarized climate, she fears her students are exposed only to the disheartening rhetoric of politicians who seem disinterested in serving the people and unwilling to engage with those who hold different views.\n\nIn a March 18 Enquirer op-ed, Senator Portman argued that the confirmation should wait until after the upcoming presidential election, despite acknowledging that the people have already spoken through the election of the current president and Senate. Portman suggests that waiting for a less partisan atmosphere will give the nominee more legitimacy and preserve the Senate and the court's institutional credibility.\n\nHowever, Mueller argues that this delay contributes to the hyper-partisan atmosphere, demonstrating for her students that politics is divisive rather than a spirited problem-solving endeavor. She questions the appropriateness of neglecting clearly defined job expectations, as Portman suggests, in any profession.\n\nAs an educator, Mueller expresses concern that political decisions based on perceived truth can erode students' trust in their leaders and their hope for meaningful political discourse. She urges Senator Portman to fulfill his duty as a public servant, setting an example for her students. If he continues to obstruct, she warns, he risks discrediting those who strive to prepare students to become the next generation's honorable leaders.\n\nIn essence, Mueller implores Senator Portman to reconsider his position, as it risks undermining the truth of the Constitution and the Founding Fathers' wisdom, portraying them as mere prose secondary to the self-serving nature of modern partisan politics.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: Charlie Cook's Analysis Shows Improved Prospects for GOP in Senate and House Races\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a detailed analysis, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report has pointed to a clear uptick in the Republican Party's fortunes in the upcoming midterm elections. The most significant change, according to Cook, is in the Senate races, where a Republican net gain of one to three seats now seems most likely, moving the GOP up to either 52 or 53 seats.\n\nThe Senate landscape has shifted dramatically over the last six weeks. Previously, the most likely outcome for the Senate was no net change or a shift of one seat, with the majority holding 50-52 seats. Today, a Republican net gain of a seat or two seems most likely, with a gain of three seats or no net change also possible. There remains some chance of Democrats picking up two seats and a majority, but those odds are long, no better than 1 in 5, and seemingly getting longer.\n\nIn the House, Democrats remain heavily favored to capture a majority. However, their chances of blowing the House wide open with a gain of 40-50 seats or more have diminished. In the suburban-oriented districts where most of the competitive House races are, things remain extremely challenging for Republicans. A large gender gap driven by suburban, college-educated, and younger women remains a very strong dynamic.\n\nHowever, the more rural- and small-town-oriented districts\u2014those with substantial numbers of Republicans, conservatives, and Trump backers\u2014are now fully awake and engaged, moving some of those districts back away from the edge of competitiveness. Republicans were looking quite vulnerable through the summer in districts that one would never guess they would have to worry about. Today, Democrats seem more in line to score a net gain of between 20 and 40 seats.\n\nIn the Senate, the most endangered incumbent on either side is Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Already trailing considerably in the polls, Heitkamp's campaign committed a truly dreadful unforced error, publicly identifying a number of women\u2014some erroneously\u2014as survivors of assault against their consent. Cornered with concrete evidence of malfeasance, Heitkamp appeared on a conservative radio show in North Dakota yesterday, profusely apologizing for a \"colossal\" screw-up.\n\nIn the New Jersey Senate race, Senate Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC, has gone up with a $3 million statewide ad buy, their first spending in the race. Meanwhile, in the Arizona Senate race, Hillary Clinton is raking in money to help scandal-plagued Bob Menendez. In the Arizona race, the Free Beacon team has released a humorous fake ad mashing up Kyrsten Sinema's damage control commercial with her various attacks against her own state.\n\nIn the Arizona Senate race, a careful statistical review shows Republican Martha McSally on the rise, but the media is doing what it can to run interference for Sinema, including mischaracterizing an accurate line of criticism from McSally. Not only did the Washington Post spell \"Kyrsten Sinema\" wrong, but they also got the quote completely wrong. McSally never accused Sinema of \"treason.\" She accused Sinema of \"saying it's okay to commit treason,\" which is backed up by video evidence.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Enters Presidential Race: A Look at His Prospects and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, announced on Tuesday his intention to explore a run for the 2016 presidency. This move, a common precursor for those aiming for the highest office, indicates Bush's impending entry into the race.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Bush is currently among the top contenders for the Republican nomination. The McClatchy-Marist poll places him and Mitt Romney in the lead with 19 and 15 percent respectively, while a PPP poll positions Bush ahead of Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz.\n\nHowever, Bush's lead is not insurmountable, and his political history and ideology may present challenges. While the Bush name holds positive connotations for some, it is a negative for others due to past history, ideology, and perceived performance in office.\n\nOne group that is expected to support Bush is the donors, bundlers, and those involved in independent expenditure. Given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election, Bush is likely to be the best-funded candidate in the Republican field.\n\nDespite his strong financial backing, Bush faces several challenges within the primary. His support for Common Core, comprehensive immigration reform, and his past consideration of tax increases as part of an overall reform package may not sit well with many in the Republican party, particularly the Tea Party and the right wing.\n\nBush is expected to address these potential disadvantages strategically. His thoughtful and reasonable message at the Wall Street CEOs conference was well-received, signaling his efforts to appeal to a broader Republican base.\n\nShould Bush make it to the general election, he will face Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. The latest poll numbers indicate a tightening race between the two, and the campaign is expected to reflect this reality.\n\nBoth Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton represent the center of their respective parties and are practical politicians. They are also smart and serious about the issues, and a thoughtful debate about America's future is likely if they are the nominees. This could potentially lead to candidate agreement on several issues, a rarity in recent decades.\n\nIn conclusion, Jeb Bush's entry into the race could provide the Republicans with their strongest candidate and possible nominee. It also offers the prospect of a thoughtful and engaging debate between the two leading candidates, potentially leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate.",
    " Title: White House Dismisses Anecdotal Evidence on Obamacare, Part-Time Jobs, and Employer Healthcare Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, the White House has dismissed anecdotal evidence suggesting that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is negatively impacting job growth and the number of hours employees are working. Jason Furman, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, stated, \"We are seeing no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working... Since the ACA became law, nearly 90 percent of the gain in employment has been in full-time positions.\"\n\nHowever, concerns about the Affordable Care Act's potential impact on business costs and hiring decisions persist. Executives at staffing and payroll firms report that the law, which requires employers with 50 or more full-time workers to provide healthcare coverage or incur penalties, is a frequently cited factor in requests for part-time workers. A decision to delay the mandate until 2015 has not significantly affected hiring decisions, they added.\n\nOne notable example of this trend is United Parcel Service Inc., which plans to remove thousands of spouses from its medical plan due to the Affordable Care Act. The Atlanta-based logistics company cites the law as a major reason for the decision, according to Kaiser Health News. The decision comes as many analysts downplay the Affordable Care Act's effect on companies like UPS, noting that the move reflects a long-term trend of shrinking corporate medical benefits. However, UPS repeatedly references Obamacare to explain the decision, fueling the debate over whether it contributes to the erosion of traditional employer coverage.\n\nAnother issue arising from the Affordable Care Act is a potential financial penalty for some workers and their families due to a quirk in the law. This quirk could result in some people being financially better off if their employer does not offer health insurance subsidies for them and their families, and instead, they purchase insurance with government subsidies on the Obamacare state health exchanges. This situation, known as the \"family glitch,\" has been criticized for creating a catch-22 situation where low-wage workers are offered \"affordable\" coverage at work, but the rates are still unaffordable in reality. As a result, these workers and their families may become or remain uninsured, facing the Obamacare tax.\n\nThis situation could lead to a surge of people entering the exchanges, potentially overwhelming the system and causing logistical problems. Additionally, the increased number of people relying on subsidies would result in higher costs for taxpayers and increased long-term deficits. Furthermore, this situation goes against the promise made to many workers and families that they could keep their existing healthcare arrangements.\n\nIn a recent poll by Gallup, a majority of business owners reported that the Affordable Care Act had not affected their hiring decisions. Raw statistics from the former Bureau of Labor Statistics chief also support this claim. Despite these findings, anecdotal evidence and specific cases, such as the UPS decision, continue to fuel the debate over the Affordable Care Act's impact on employment and healthcare coverage.",
    " Title: Major Nidal Hasan's Trial for Fort Hood Shooting Begins, Raising Questions of Terrorism and Military Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nThe trial of Major Nidal Hasan, a U.S. Army officer, began on Tuesday for his role in the deadly attack at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009. In his opening statement, Hasan, who has long expressed his guilt, stated, \"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\"\n\nHasan is accused of opening fire at a training center, resulting in the deaths of 13 individuals and injuring numerous others. He was shot by a responding police officer and is now partially paralyzed from the injury.\n\nThough the final verdict is expected to be a conviction, the trial's significance lies in its impact on the military-justice system, the victims and their families, and the ongoing question of whether the attack was an act of terrorism. The trial's first day made these stakes clear.\n\nThe U.S. armed services have not executed anyone since 1961. Eleven of 16 military death-penalty cases during the past 30 years have been overturned, leaving five soldiers at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., still awaiting execution.\n\nMilitary-justice experts say Col. Tara Osborn, the presiding judge, has taken great care to ensure the verdict and sentence in this trial survive any appeals. For instance, in the long run-up to the much-delayed trial, Hasan pleaded with the court to acknowledge his guilt, but Colonel Osborn, given that the prosecution is seeking the death penalty, denied that request. She has also allowed Hasan to defend himself, giving him wide legal leeway.\n\n\"This is one case they\u2019re absolutely determined to [not be brought down on appeal]. Since military capital punishment has been so plagued and riddled with errors, they\u2019re trying to learn from those mistakes [with the Hasan case], and they\u2019re going to [try to get a conviction] pretty much how long it takes, and whatever resources they take,\" said David Frakt, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, to the Monitor earlier this summer.\n\nThe scene at the readiness center was one of terror and mayhem, with unarmed soldiers trying to flee and hide behind desks and tables. Now, victims face the prospect of taking the stand to explain what they saw and then being cross-examined by the man on trial for unleashing a hail of bullets against them.\n\nColonel Osborn's ruling that Hasan can defend himself has been widely seen as an insult to survivors and the families of those who died. Delays in the trial have also worn on possible witnesses and the broader military community in Texas and beyond.\n\nYet at least some of the 30 victims scheduled to testify say they are anxious to help convict a man they see as a traitor.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to dread anything. That\u2019s a sign of fear,\" injured Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford told the Associated Press. \"That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again.\"\n\nOn its first day, the trial shed light on the motives for the attack. Although President Obama on May 23 said Hasan\u2019s act may have been \u201cinspired by larger notions of jihad,\u201d the Obama administration has defined the attack as an act of workplace violence.\n\nIn his opening statement Tuesday, Hasan said, \"Evidence will show I was on the wrong side of America's war and I later switched sides. We in the mujahideen are imperfect beings trying to establish a perfect religion.\u2026 I apologize for any mistakes I have made in this endeavor.\"\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Lt. Col. Steve Henricks, said of Hasan, \"He did not want to deploy [to Afghanistan] and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to murder soldiers.\" Hasan, Colonel Henricks said, wanted to \"kill as many soldiers as he could.\"\n\nGovernment officials say that starting in 2008, Hasan sent more than a dozen emails to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric whom the U.S. killed with a drone strike in 2011.\n\nIn a pretrial motion, Hasan told Osborn that he had acted in defense of \"the leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban\" by targeting U.S. soldiers ready to be deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. However, she said he could not use that defense in court. Legally, experts say, it would be impossible to prove, since there was no evidence that the particular soldiers he targeted posed any direct risk to Taliban leaders.\n\nThe issue is more than semantic. Victims are ineligible for some Army benefits because their injuries are not classified as \"combat related.\" Meanwhile, Hasan is still collecting a pension.\n\nIf classified as a terrorist attack, the Fort Hood shootings would be the deadliest on U.S. soil since 9/11. The shootings fit a shift in the war on terror after 9/11, in which plots against the American homeland were most often carried out by self-radicalized \"lone wolves.\"",
    " Title: President's Immigration Plan: A Political Move or a Last-Ditch Effort for Re-election?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to secure votes in the Latino community, particularly in key states like New Mexico and Colorado, President Obama has announced a plan to grant work permits to young, undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria. However, the question remains as to how many young people under 30 who meet these criteria are currently being pursued and deported.\n\nAccording to the Pew Hispanic Center, 16% of the population under 25 falls into this category. The President's plan, therefore, may not have a significant impact on the number of undocumented immigrants in the workforce, as historically high levels of unemployment among young people already exist.\n\nThe President's proposal comes amidst repeated promises to address the issue of immigration reform, a pledge he has failed to fulfill. Critics argue that the President's plan creates more competition in an already struggling cohort of the labor market.\n\nThe President's plan was reportedly a response to pleas from Democrat senators. However, it has been suggested that the President's plan could impede the progress of a more comprehensive and permanent solution, such as the one being proposed by Republican Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio, who is reportedly working on a legislative solution to address the immigration crisis, was seen as a political nightmare for the Democrats, who are hoping to cement the Latino vote by handing out tokens like this one while accusing the Republicans of being anti-Latino.\n\nInstead of working with Rubio to hammer out legislation that would address the problem in a serious and permanent way, the President chose the path that would benefit himself and his allies politically. This decision has been criticized for potentially poisoning the water for any real and lasting reform, to the detriment of those who need it most.\n\nThe President himself has acknowledged that the executive action is not his to take. However, the analysis sets aside the President's unconscionable arrogation of power, a move that is seen as inimical to the long-term health of our republic and its separation of powers.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Latinos will understand that the President has done little to advance their real long-term interests, and whether he has been hoping to hoodwink them, willing to make them pawns to further his own electoral prospects at their ultimate expense. The contrast between the President's approach and that of his predecessor, President Reagan, who believed there was no limit to what could be achieved if you don't care who gets the credit, is striking. President Obama, on the other hand, does not care if anything is achieved so long as he can claim whatever credit there is.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Disrupt Impeachment Hearing, Delay Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary's Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on Thursday, nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, disrupted a closed-door impeachment hearing by barging into the session. The lawmakers' actions delayed the testimony of Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper, who was scheduled to appear before three committees as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe chaotic scene, which has been described by some as a \"storming\" of the hearing, represented a new and more confrontational phase of the GOP attack on House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and the Democratic impeachment investigation.\n\nAccording to a report by Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb of CNN, the Republican lawmakers flouted House rules to make a political point, delaying Cooper's testimony by hours. The term \"stormed\" has been widely used to describe the lawmakers' actions, but CNN's chief national correspondent John King suggested that \"barged\" might be a more accurate term, given the chaotic nature of the event.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican, tweeted that he was initially told that the GOP took the secure facility by force, likening it to a \"GOP version of Occupy Wall Street.\" However, it was later clarified that the protest was peaceful.\n\nA GOP congressman involved in Wednesday's protest told CNN's Dana Bash that the protest had been on his calendar for about a week. Initially, it was intended to be a traditional press conference, but it was only when it was actually happening that the congressman realized they were going to the secure facility.\n\nTrump, who had met with some of the lawmakers involved in the protest at the White House on Tuesday, had advance knowledge of the plans to attempt entry to the secure facility, a person familiar with the matter told CNN's Kevin Liptak.\n\nThe lawmakers entered the secure room, where the closed hearings are taking place and where cellphones are not allowed. Some had to clarify that their tweets, which originally purported to be inside the facility, were actually posted from outside by staff members. They were brought pizza, which is allowed. They left at 2 p.m. for votes.\n\nThe most effective Republican gripe about the impeachment process thus far has been about process. There was no vote to kick things off. There have not yet been open hearings or transcripts released. The argument goes that if this is a trial, the President has been robbed of due process.\n\nIt's important to remember that Republicans who sit on the committees that are running the impeachment inquiry are in the hearings during testimony. However, it's certainly not an open process, and Trump does not have attorneys there.\n\nThe Constitution says very little about how the impeachment process should play out, and the courts have tried to stay out of it. But the trial phase will come later, in the Senate, if it gets to that. Democrats like Schiff have promised there will eventually be open hearings during the process.\n\nTrump's use of the term \"no quid pro quo\" has been a central part of his defense against the impeachment inquiry. However, as Jake Tapper pointed out in a recent segment, the term \"quid pro quo\" does not appear in several key places, including The Federalist Papers, initial news stories about the whistleblower complaint, and Bill Taylor's testimony.\n\nDespite this, Trump continues to cling to the idea of \"no quid pro quo\" as his defense, regardless of what the complaint, the call transcript, or the growing list of witnesses say. The impeachment inquiry is expected to continue, with more testimony and hearings scheduled in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Invoke Insurrection Act, Calls for Swift Action Against Riots\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a brief speech in the Rose Garden on Monday evening, President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order in American cities if mayors and governors fail to do so. The president's remarks came amid ongoing protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump called the death of Floyd a \"brutal death\" and stated that \"justice will be served\" in the legal process underway in Minneapolis. He also acknowledged the mix of Antifa and looters causing the mayhem and emphasized the need to act vigorously to stop it.\n\nThe president's authority to send in the military under the Insurrection Act is widely believed to be within his power. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement only when there isn't statutory authorization. If the president determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages\" are making it impossible to enforce the laws in a state, he can act.\n\nInvoking the Insurrection Act would not constitute imposing a dictatorship or waging a war on the American people, as some may argue. The use of the military in such situations has occurred in the past, including during the Los Angeles riots in 1992, the riots in 1968, and during the enforcement of federal desegregation law in 1957.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether Trump could, as a practical matter, invoke the Insurrection Act over the objections of state and local officials. Having competing authorities trying to police the same out-of-control streets is not a formula for success.\n\nMinnesota has called out the National Guard, and Minneapolis, the first city to experience these disturbances, has been relatively calm for three straight nights. New York has avoided calling the Guard, and New York City was a scene of rioting and looting on Monday night. Cities need to impose early curfews, vigorously enforce them, and call out the National Guard if they have any doubt that the police can do the job on their own.\n\nTrump's language about \"dominating\" the streets may be inflammatory, but the basic point is correct. However, the president has faced criticism for his incendiary tweets and insulting commentary on the performance of local officials. His performance was also marred by his photo-op in front of St. John's church, which some argue was a petty and foolish use of government authority.\n\nThe nation could be on the cusp of a full-blown crisis if the riots continue. It would be much better if our leaders, including the president, acted with more restraint and empathy in their response to the ongoing protests.",
    " Title: Two Arrested on Suspicion of Arson in Grimsby Mosque as UK Forms Extremism Task Force\n\nIn the aftermath of the brutal slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby in London, the United Kingdom is grappling with a wave of extremist activities. On Sunday, two men were arrested on suspicion of arson following a fire at a mosque in the city of Grimsby, on the country's east coast. This incident coincided with inciting messages on social media, according to Humberside County police.\n\nThe arrests come as Britain is forming a task force to examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country. Led by Prime Minister David Cameron, the task force will focus on extremist groups, with a particular emphasis on Islamist extremism, according to a statement from Downing Street. The Muslim Council of Britain, however, has urged the task force to consider extremism from all quarters, emphasizing the importance of avoiding policies and measures that may exacerbate extremism.\n\nThe brutal killing of Lee Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in southeast London on Wednesday has shocked the nation. The incident also triggered a far-right-wing street demonstration in northern England, where protesters called for Muslims to leave Britain.\n\nNine individuals have been arrested in connection with the Woolwich attack, including three men who were taken into custody on Saturday and another on Sunday. The three arrested on Saturday were released on bail on Monday, police said. The men, aged 21, 22, 24, and 28, were arrested by detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command and taken to a south London police station.\n\nTwo men who were arrested at the scene of the killing are currently under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police. Britain's MI5 intelligence agency is expected to report the results of a preliminary investigation into the suspects this week to the Intelligence and Security Committee.\n\nThe family of Lee Rigby visited the scene of his death on Sunday. Far-right English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson addressed a crowd in Newcastle on Saturday, calling for the soldier's death not to be in vain. Robinson's speech drew between 1,500 and 2,000 people, while a counter-demonstration attracted a few hundred, police said.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has urged the task force to look at extremism from all quarters, emphasizing the importance of avoiding policies and measures that may exacerbate extremism. The council's secretary-general, Farooq Murad, stated, \"We must be vigilant and ensure we do not inadvertently give into the demands of all extremists: making our society less free, divided, and suspicious of each other. Lessons from the past indicate that policies and measures taken in haste can exacerbate extremism.\"",
    " Title: Global Temperatures Projected to Reach Critical Milestone in the 2030s, According to U.S. Climate Scientists\n\nAritcle:\n\nTwo of the U.S. government's leading climate scientists have predicted that global temperatures will continue to rise over the next decade and will reach a critical milestone in the 2030s. The climate change that made the 2010s the hottest decade in recorded history will persist unabated in the 2020s, and by 2035, global temperatures will reach a critical level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the scientists said.\n\nDeke Arndt, climate monitoring chief for NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, stated, \"Notwithstanding some sort of major, major geophysical event, it would be almost certain that the [next] decade will be warmer than the previous. It's almost certain that we would break one annual record during the process.\"\n\nGavin Schmidt, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, added, \"The global warming trend line since the 1970s has been quite close to linear. Extrapolate forward and you would imagine we would cross 1.5 degrees around 2035.\"\n\nThe Paris climate accord aims to keep global temperatures from rising by 1.5 C or more to avert the worst climate catastrophes, such as rampant sea-level rise and more destructive wildfires, floods, and storms. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated last year that the window to limit warming to 1.5 C will close around 2030.\n\nThe scientists' report, released yesterday by NASA and NOAA, mirrors conclusions from other climate agencies such as the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, which stated last week that 2019 was the second-hottest year since record-keeping began in 1880. The hottest year is 2016.\n\nArndt and Schmidt highlighted the similarity of five recent studies of global temperature trends to support their findings. \"These are five independent analyses that make different assumptions. It doesn't really matter which way you cut it, it always looks the same,\" Schmidt said. \"The fact is the planet is warming. The main thing here is not really the ranking [of 2019] but the consistency of the methodology and the long-term trends that we're seeing.\"\n\nWarming patterns are especially acute in the Arctic, which is heating up three times as quickly as the rest of the planet, Arndt said. At the same time, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic is falling, triggering sea-level rise and contributing to global warming.\n\nThe researchers attributed the recent trends to human-induced climate change caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions. \"Climate change in the past had nothing to do with human activity,\" Schmidt said, referring to warming that occurred thousands and hundreds of thousands of years ago due to Earth's orbit or massive asteroids or volcanic eruptions. \"That explanation fails in the 20th century because we know there hasn't been an asteroid and hasn't been a massive volcano.\"\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E & E News.

    " Title: Chicago Teachers' Union Strike Prompts School Closures in Nation's Third-Largest District\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Teachers Union has announced a strike set to begin Thursday, October 17, 2019, after months of negotiations with Chicago Public Schools failed to resolve disputes over pay, benefits, class size, and teacher preparation time. The strike, Chicago's first major walkout by teachers since 2012, has prompted the city to preemptively cancel classes in the nation's third-largest school district.\n\nChicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey stated during a union news conference that the union aims for a short strike with an agreement that will benefit schools and teachers, but they have a ways to go. Mayor Lori Lightfoot expressed her disappointment with the union's decision to strike.\n\nIn the 2012 strike, the district kept some schools open for half days during a seven-day walkout. This time, all buildings will be open during school hours, staffed by principals and employees who usually work in administrative roles. Breakfast and lunch will be served, but all after-school activities and school buses are suspended.\n\nJanice Jackson, the district's CEO, encouraged parents to send their children to the school they normally attend, but they will be welcome in any district schools. The district is also preparing for 7,000 support staffers to strike, whose union also failed to reach a contract agreement.\n\nParents like June Davis, who would likely send her 7-year-old son, Joshua, to his usual elementary school, Smyth Elementary on the city's South Side, are scrambling to make arrangements. Davis, 38, said she would otherwise have to take her son to his grandmother's in a southern suburb, requiring an hourlong trip on a regional bus line.\n\nMayor Lightfoot preemptively announced that classes on Thursday would be canceled, saying she wanted to give parents more time to plan. The city has not only offered a 16% pay raise over the five-year contract, but the city also agreed to put language in the contract addressing \"enforceable targets\" on class size and increasing staffing levels for positions such as nurses, librarians, and social workers.\n\nHowever, union leaders dispute Lightfoot's characterization of the city's willingness to concede to their demands on several issues, including class sizes. Community organizations have been preparing for days to welcome students, ranging from a $100 per day camp for elementary school kids at the Shedd Aquarium to all-day programs run by the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago and accessible for a $20 annual membership fee.\n\nThe city's public libraries also are planning programs for students, along with a network of churches and community centers that are part of the city's Safe Haven program intended to give kids a safe place during the summer months particularly on the city's South and West sides. The YMCA of Metro Chicago expects the highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12, who are too young to stay home alone but whose parents may oppose sending them to schools unstaffed by teachers.",
    " Title: The Affordable Care Act: A Look at Its Creation and the Ongoing Legal Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, a landmark legislation passed in 2010, has been the subject of much debate and controversy in recent years. The law, which took months, if not years, from drafting to passage, was primarily the product of a Democratic supermajority in Congress. The end of this Democratic supermajority has led to the challenges the law currently faces.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of King v. Burwell, which centers on the interpretation of a specific phrase in the ACA and whether the federal government can subsidize federal health exchanges. Representative Darrell Issa, in a tweet on November 7, 2014, stated, \"The sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created #Obamacare is rightly catching up to it.\"\n\nWhile the ACA may not have been \"rushed\" in terms of the calendar length it took for Democrats to draft and pass the legislation, the process was not without its speedbumps. Initial congressional deliberations began in April 2009, and President Obama signed it 11 months later in March 2010. However, Democrats advocated for expedited timetables to push the legislation through.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi broke her pledge to post the final legislative language of the ACA 72 hours in advance of the final vote amidst pressure from progressive media outlets that reading the bill was a waste of time. The legislative language of the bill is what's at issue in the Halbig v. Burwell case.\n\nOnce Scott Brown was elected in a special election in Massachusetts and broke the Democrats' supermajority, the Democrats had to resort to unconventional means for passing the bill. As Bernstein writes, \"ordinary fixes\" could not be implemented.\n\nRepublicans were firmly against these \"ordinary fixes.\" The Obama Administration pursued health reform centered on the individual mandate, guaranteed issue, and community rating triumvirate - a policy that Republicans in 2010 thought would make the American health care system worse. Indeed, President Obama in 2008 ran against this form of a health care system. It's been pointed out that some Republicans formerly favored this kind of a system. However, this is mostly irrelevant. If President Obama can change his mind, so can Republicans.\n\nBecause Republicans were so firmly set against the mandate/CR/GI system and because Democrats had a supermajority, they did not need to listen to the GOP's protestations and were able to craft the entire system without any GOP input whatsoever. This had the effect of hardening GOP opposition - something that came back to bite the Democrats once Scott Brown won his surprising special election in Massachusetts.\n\nRepublicans did not have a say in the crafting of Obamacare in the first place - Democrats did not need to let them have one, after all - but once they had the ability to filibuster, they used what little power they had to try to gum up the works.\n\nThe process of \"ordinary fixes\" would have required Republicans to go along with strengthening the mandate/CR/GI system that they opposed. As Obamacare was being crafted, it became clear that the whole system was not going to be popular with the American people. Why would Republicans, in this scenario, want to help Democrats pass a law they think will make the health system worse work better?\n\nThe Democrats cut Republicans out of the process early on in the ACA drafting stage. That's perfectly legitimate, and it was their right to do so, especially as Republicans had such strong objections to the mandate/CR/GI system. But by committing to that system, they committed to strong Republican opposition, and had to commit to using reconciliation and eschewing these \"ordinary fixes\" when the GOP gained the filibuster ability earlier than Democrats had hoped. Republicans, both post-Brown election and now, have had no obligation to help Democrats fix the drafting errors in the legislation they crafted.",
    " Title: Sri Lanka's Gotabaya Rajapaksa Appoints Brother Mahinda as Prime Minister, Forming a Family-led Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political shift, the newly-elected Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has named his brother, Mahinda, as prime minister, consolidating the influence of the Rajapaksa clan, credited with ending the Tamil Tigers' 26-year-long civil war a decade ago. Mahinda, a two-term president himself, is set to be sworn in as prime minister on Thursday following the resignation of Ranil Wickremesinghe after his party suffered a crushing defeat in the weekend's presidential polls.\n\nThe Rajapaksa brothers, known for their hardline approach during the civil war, are accused of war crimes and multiple human rights abuses. Mahinda, aged 74, will be sworn in by his younger brother Gotabaya, aged 70. Two other brothers, Basil and Chamal, are also active in politics.\n\nWith Mahinda taking over as prime minister, Sri Lanka will for the first time have two brothers at the helm. During the first Mahinda presidency, the eldest brother, Chamal, was the speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Wickremesinghe, who formally announced his resignation on Wednesday, cleared the way for the Rajapaksas to form a minority government ahead of snap elections, expected around April next year. Wickremesinghe's party put forward Sajith Premadasa in the presidential election but was soundly beaten by Gotabaya in a highly divisive election in the island nation of 21.6 million.\n\nThe Rajapaksas are expected to name an interim cabinet to govern the island until the next parliamentary election. In the lead-up to the presidential vote, Rajapaksa's campaign emphasized his credentials as the defence secretary who ended the bloody civil war between government forces and Tamil rebels.\n\nThe new president has pledged to fight corruption and improve security in the wake of a series of bombings on Easter Sunday that killed over 260 people. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nRights groups have long called for investigations into alleged rights abuses committed during the Rajapaksas' previous terms in power, including United Nations allegations that more than 40,000 people were killed by security forces in the final days of the country's civil war in the north, as Tamil rebels took shelter among civilians. The new president also faces a civil suit in the United States for allegedly ordering the torture of a Tamil man and several others when he was the defence secretary.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda's Core Leadership Weakened, but Affiliates Remain Active in Yemen and North Africa\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent debate, former President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney discussed the ongoing threat of Al Qaeda, with Obama stating that the core leadership of the terrorist group has been severely weakened, while Romney claimed that Al Qaeda branches have spread to almost a dozen countries.\n\nDuring the debate, Romney emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy to combat extremism, stating, \"This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has taken significant steps to combat Al Qaeda, with the operation of armed unmanned aircraft in Pakistan increasing dramatically, resulting in nearly 300 strikes and the removal of numerous extremists from the battlefield. Notable figures killed in recent years include Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, the No. 2 to current leader Ayman al Zawahiri; Sayeed al-Masri, No. 3 in the hierarchy; and Abu Ayyub al Masri, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nHowever, the threat from Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, North Africa, and other parts of the Middle East remains a concern. In particular, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which operates in Yemen, has become a more powerful Al Qaeda franchise since its formation in 2009. AQAP has been responsible for several high-profile attacks, including the failed attempt to kill the Saudi prince who ran the country's counterterrorism campaign in 2009, the attempt by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009, and plans to blow up cargo planes destined for the United States in 2010 and to put a suicide bomber aboard a passenger aircraft earlier this year.\n\nThe unrest in Syria has also provided an opportunity for Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) to extend its reach into the war-torn nation, with intelligence officials expressing concern that its presence in Syria will grow as the chaos continues. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which operates in northern Africa, is another group seen to be taking advantage of the current situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the core leadership of Al Qaeda has been weakened, the affiliates remain active, particularly in Yemen and North Africa, where the threat to Western interests and plotting against the homeland remain strong. Romney's claim that Al Qaeda is in 10 to 12 countries is in the ballpark, and the administration would seem to agree that this poses an enormous threat.",
    " Title: Obama's Tougher Negotiating Style: A Shift from the Past and a Response to the 2012 Election Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's recent approach to the fiscal cliff negotiations has shown a more combative demeanor compared to his previous, more conciliatory negotiating style. This shift can be traced back to the lessons he learned from his hard-fought victory in the 2012 election.\n\nObama's re-election victory, marked by his triumph over Mitt Romney, has instilled in him a renewed sense of confidence and resolve. The president, who once emphasized bipartisanship after his 2008 win, is now determined to extract bipartisanship from the Republicans, a move he believes is owed to the people who voted for him.\n\nAccording to interviews with staffers and friends for \"The End of the Line,\" an eBook published in collaboration between \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Random House, Obama's victory in 2012 was sweeter than his initial win in 2008. The outcome of the election was a significant factor in determining his legacy, and the president was acutely aware of the stakes.\n\nWith the election behind him, the president is now seen as a resilient and popular figure who, if given a chance, could potentially unify the country. David Plouffe, Obama's most influential political adviser, stated that the campaign's organizational success was rooted in the belief in the candidate, and the people turned out for Obama, not just for the campaign.\n\nHowever, the euphoria following the election has been short-lived. The White House has been thrust into a repetitive partisan battle, making any talk of a new \"mandate\" seem implausible. The fractious and collapsing GOP House majority leaves Obama in a more precarious position, at least in the short term.\n\nSo far, Obama has taken a firm stance, refusing to provide specifics on spending and entitlement cuts, and threatening GOP leaders with the bully pulpit of his inauguration and State of the Union speech. However, many Hill Democrats, accustomed to seeing Obama compromise, remain cautiously optimistic.\n\n\"So far, so good. We'll see how this shakes out,\" said a top Senate Democrat, expressing apprehension about the administration's overtures to the GOP on entitlement reform. The fiscal cliff negotiations continue, with both parties seeking a resolution that will avert a potential economic crisis.",
    " Title: Susan Rice's Unmasking Allegations: A Matter of Controversy and Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Susan Rice situation, shrouded in uncertainty, has taken a new turn as the former National Security Advisor has changed her narrative regarding the allegations of unmasking Donald Trump or his associates during the Obama administration.\n\nInitially, when asked about this matter by PBS's Judy Woodruff a few weeks ago, Rice claimed ignorance, stating that she was learning about it from news reports. However, following reports by Fox News and Bloomberg's Eli Lake, Rice broke her silence on MSNBC yesterday.\n\nIn her interview with Andrea Mitchell, Rice explained that requesting the identities of Americans picked up on intercepts was not uncommon and necessary for her to perform her duties. She emphasized that it was \"absolutely false\" to suggest this was done for political purposes.\n\nThis shift from professed ignorance to a denial of impropriety has raised several questions. Was Rice's unmasking request solely for intelligence purposes, or did she have political motivations? Did she leak any of the findings, or cause them to be leaked? Rice denied leaking anything related to her successor, Michael Flynn, whose false denials about contacts with the Russian ambassador led to his dismissal by President Trump.\n\nWhile some news outlets, such as the Washington Post and New York Times, have downplayed these allegations, some on the right argue that they are covering for Rice. ABC, NBC, and CBS did not cover the allegations on Monday's evening newscasts, while the \"CBS Evening News\" quoted a former official as saying Rice did \"nothing improper or political.\"\n\nThe complexity of this situation lies in the fact that many news outlets have been unable to confirm the allegations, which raises the question of whether to publish something based on other outlets citing unnamed sources when one's own reporters cannot verify it.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of these same outlets have run stories, also involving anonymous sources, about alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russia. The media are currently on two different planes, with some more interested in proving a Russia/Trump conspiracy and others more interested in proving an Obama surveillance conspiracy.\n\nHard facts are scarce, but it would be ideal if the same standards were applied to both parts of this intriguing story. The media's role is to inform the public, and it is crucial to maintain objectivity and neutrality in the face of conflicting narratives.",
    " Title: Thousands Protest Against President Trump's Visit to the United Kingdom, Citing Policies and Charged Rhetoric\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of London to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump during his four-day working visit to the United Kingdom. According to CNBC, over 60 protests are scheduled, with estimates of 50,000 to 100,000 people participating.\n\nThe demonstrations began on Friday morning, with protesters carrying signs and placards criticizing the president's policies and rhetoric. One protester, who has gained attention on social media, donned a \"Trump Dalek\" costume, a reference to the feared alien race from the popular British television program \"Doctor Who.\"\n\nA giant blimp depicting Trump as a baby was also flown over Parliament Square. Despite Trump's previous statement that Londoners \"like [him] a lot,\" he later expressed feelings of being \"unwelcome\" due to the planned protests.\n\n\"I used to love London as a city,\" Trump told The Sun newspaper. \"I haven't been there in a long time. But when they make you feel unwelcome, why would I stay there?\"\n\nTrump's schedule primarily avoids the planned protests, as he will only be in London for one night. In January 2017, over 1 million people in the U.K. signed a petition demanding Trump's visit be canceled following his executive order blocking refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Distances City, Police Department from Racially-Charged Photo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to distance the Chicago Police Department from a racially-charged photo that surfaced this week, Mayor Rahm Emanuel stated on Wednesday that the image does not represent the values of the city or the department. The photo, believed to have been taken between 1999 and 2003 at a Chicago police station, depicts two former Chicago police officers, Timothy McDermott and Jerome Finnigan, in a pose that resembles hunters with an unidentified African-American man lying on his stomach with deer antlers on his head.\n\nThe publication of the photo comes at a time when Chicago, like many other major cities in the U.S., is working to repair strained relations with the African-American community. Earlier this month, the city council approved an unprecedented reparations package for mostly African-American victims who were tortured by police officers under the control of former police commander Jon Burge. From 1972 through 1991, these victims were subjected to mock executions, electric shock, and beatings with telephone books, while their interrogators hurled racial slurs.\n\nIn April, Emanuel announced his support for the Burge reparations package, and the city approved a $5 million payout to Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot 16 times by police last fall. Last month, Superintendent Garry McCarthy launched a listening tour to meet with residents and community leaders to mend relations between police and minority communities.\n\nThe officers in the antler photo were part of a disgraced special unit that was accused of robbing drug dealers and other individuals of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Finnigan is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for robbery and home invasion after pleading guilty in 2011. McDermott was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing but was fired from the police department last year due to the photo. The Chicago Police Board, which oversees disciplinary matters, voted 5-4 to fire McDermott. The dissenting board members thought a suspension was a more appropriate punishment.\n\nMcDermott has since sued to reverse his dismissal. In an internal affairs investigation, he described the incident as a youthful indiscretion. \"I was asked to join the photo and I did so without exercising proper judgment,\" McDermott said according to the transcript. \"I made a mistake as a young, impressionable police officer who was trying to fit in. I wish I could go back and change this split-second decision.\"\n\nThe photo came to the attention of the CPD after federal prosecutors gave the photo to police in 2013, following Finnigan's prison sentence. The department attempted to keep the image out of the public eye, citing the privacy of the unidentified suspect shown in the photo. However, a judge refused to hide the picture in March, and the Chicago Sun-Times obtained the image from the court file. Police were never able to identify the suspect, who was never charged.\n\n\"As the superintendent of this department, and as a resident of our city, I will not tolerate this kind of behavior,\" McCarthy told the Sun-Times. \"I fired one of the officers, and I would have fired the other if he had not already been fired by the time I found out about the picture.\"",
    " Title: Colorado Republican Delegates Allocate to Cruz Amid Trump's Controversy Over State's Unconventional Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Sen. Ted Cruz has secured all 34 delegates from Colorado in the Republican primary, despite the state not holding a traditional primary election. The move has sparked controversy and criticism from Donald Trump, who has taken to Twitter to express his displeasure.\n\nThe Cruz campaign strategically navigated the unconventional caucus process in Colorado, capturing delegates at a series of seven congressional district meetings and the state party convention in Colorado Springs. The Republican Party of Colorado canceled the party's presidential straw poll in August to avoid binding its delegates to a candidate who might not survive until the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nInstead, Republicans selected national delegates through the caucus process, a move that put the election of national delegates in the hands of party insiders and activists, leaving approximately 90% of the more than 1 million Republican voters on the sidelines. This decision caused significant controversy at the time and removed Colorado from the Republican primary map in the early stages of the campaign.\n\nTrump, in a series of tweets on Sunday evening, called the results \"totally unfair.\" He argued that the people of Colorado were denied a vote in the Republican primary due to a system that favored party insiders. Trump's campaign, however, had chosen not to compete in Colorado, citing the system's bias towards party insiders as their reason for not getting involved.\n\nIn contrast, the Cruz campaign had been actively engaged in Colorado for months, working to secure endorsements and win over delegates. Rep. Ken Buck, Cruz's state chairman, stated, \"Over 100 people have been working since last year, to get people out to caucuses to elect people to the convention. Now we are in the process of seeing a return on our investment.\"\n\nWhether or not one agrees with Colorado's decision to cancel its traditional caucus is a separate issue. Cruz's victory, however, can be attributed to his campaign's strategic efforts to work within the established process and rules. His campaign spokeswoman noted that Cruz won fair and square by adhering to the process and rules in place.",
    " Title: Pelosi and Waters Clash with Fellow Democrats Over Impeachment of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has stated that it is \"not worth it\" to attempt impeaching President Donald Trump, citing the potential for divisiveness within the country. Pelosi told the Washington Post, \"Unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country.\"\n\nHowever, Pelosi also expressed her disapproval of Trump, stating, \"Are we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here? All of the above. No. No. I don't think he is... I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I do not think he's fit to be president of the United States.\"\n\nThe reaction from fellow Democrats on Pelosi's rejection of impeachment is mixed. Some believe there is not enough evidence against the president or public support for impeachment, while others are not giving up their push to impeach him.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Examiner that she disagrees with the speaker. She believes Pelosi's view could change if something is revealed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Trump lawmakers like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) are not giving up their attempts to impeach Trump. Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, is probing Trump's finances. \"The Constitution gives us the authority and the responsibility to decide whether a president is acting in the best interest of his country... I believe we have everything needed to basically impeach Trump,\" Waters recently stated on MSNBC.\n\nWaters recently tweeted, \"For the faint of heart, who've been waiting for every 't' to be crossed and every 'i' to be dotted, now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism. Support impeachment!\"\n\nFreshman congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who publicly called Trump a \"motherf***er,\" is also not giving up her plans to impeach Trump. \"Today, I announced that later this month, I will be introducing a resolution to have the Judiciary Committee move on investigating grounds for impeachment. Our democracy must be protected,\" she tweeted recently.\n\nThe left-wing media is also not giving up on their hopes of impeaching Trump. MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, \"Some argue that the push for impeachment (of President Trump) is ahead of schedule. I think a stronger argument can be made it's behind schedule.\"\n\nThis division within the Democratic Party over the impeachment of President Trump is a significant development and will likely continue to unfold in the coming weeks and months.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Clarifies: Government Can Mandate School Attendance, but Not Provide Education\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent ruling, Judge Stephen Murphy III of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, has made it clear that while the government can compel attendance at schools, it does not have the obligation to provide an education there. The ruling comes from a case originating in Detroit, where plaintiffs accused Governor Rick Snyder and other state officials of depriving students of a right to education or even basic literacy while the city was under emergency management.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that this lack of education violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The State of Michigan countered that the complaint, a demand for \"access to literacy,\" was not constitutionally recognized. The judge agreed, though he expressed sympathy for the students, and dismissed the case.\n\nThe dismissal has sparked some outrage, with the plaintiffs promising to appeal. However, this outcome should not come as a surprise, as courts have been hesitant to define what constitutes a \"right\" to education. In a 1973 Supreme Court case, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, it was determined that the U.S. Constitution did not establish a \"fundamental right to education.\"\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs were arguing that they were not receiving any education at all. While literacy is of paramount importance, as it is essential for voting, civic participation, and accessing justice, among other things, it does not necessarily make access to literacy a fundamental right. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the importance of a good or service does not determine whether it must be regarded as fundamental.\n\nJudge Murphy cited previous examples where courts have ruled that there is no fundamental right to water or sewer service, and that the Due Process Clause does not compel the state to protect a child from an abusive parent or from a bully in school.\n\nThe judge's ruling does not imply that the decision is incorrect. If courts were to rule that schools were constitutionally mandated to provide a certain level of education, the subsequent lawsuits would be numerous, as everyone would attempt to define that level of education. The education system is already embroiled in a culture war about what schools should teach. The last thing we need is for the courts to become involved in determining those boundaries.\n\nHowever, what people should take away from this ruling is the importance of competition and choice in driving schools to improve. If the courts cannot force schools to provide a certain level of education, parents and students must be free to choose other schools. Education should be a marketplace. A court cannot order a grocery store to sell certain products, but they know that if they do not provide what customers need, someone else will, and they will lose business. Schools should be the same way.\n\nThere is evidence to show that when charter schools and other school choice options are available, public schools start to improve. If the courts lack the authority to force schools to provide a certain level of education, we should ensure that parents have access to school choice to decide what is best for their own children.",
    " Title: Muslims in India and Bangladesh Celebrate Subdued Eid al-Fitr Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nMuslims in India and Bangladesh observed a muted Eid al-Fitr on Monday, marking the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan under the looming threat of the coronavirus pandemic. The three-day holiday, which traditionally involves travel, family gatherings, and feasts after weeks of dawn-to-dusk fasting, was marked by home prayers, quieter celebrations, and concerns about the virus and the impact of lockdowns and other restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nIn New Delhi, outside the iconic Mughal-era Jama Masjid, closed as part of a ban on religious congregations, security officers patrolled the streets, and almost all shops were closed, barring a sweets shop. Police made rounds on motorbikes, and a mini police camp stood just outside a gate. \"It's been 1,400 years since the Islam religion was founded... even our elders could never imagine that we will have to celebrate Eid in such a way,\" businessman Shehzad Khan told The Associated Press news agency. He added that money typically spent on new clothes for Eid was sent to the poor, who have lost their livelihoods due to the virus and the measures taken to contain it. \"That money we have given them so that they too can celebrate Eid with us,\" Khan said.\n\nIn Bangladesh, authorities discouraged mass prayers in open fields, which normally attract tens of thousands. Devotees could join prayers at mosques while maintaining safe distances. On Monday morning, those praying in the country's more than 300,000 mosques wore masks, and many wore gloves as well. In Dhaka's main Baitul Mokarram mosque, thousands joined the prayers in phases as authorities allowed them to enter in groups, and prayers were held every hour. Many waited in lines for more than an hour to enter the premises. \"This is a new experience. We never felt like this,\" government official Abdul Halim told The AP news agency after attending the prayer. \"I did not bring my two sons for the prayers, they are staying home. My family could not visit my parents this time.\"\n\nAcross the two countries, government and religious leaders appealed to Eid celebrants to adhere to lockdown norms and maintain a safe physical distance. India has seen a surge in coronavirus cases, with over 138,000 cases and 4,000 deaths. It has eased its strict lockdown in recent weeks, including allowing domestic flights to resume from Monday. \"Eid Mubarak!\" Modi tweeted. \"May this special occasion further the spirit of compassion, brotherhood, and harmony. May everyone be healthy and prosperous.\"\n\nIn Bangladesh, new cases and deaths from COVID-19 are on the rise, with 35,585 cases and 501 deaths confirmed. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina offered Eid greetings but emphasized the need to follow health guidelines and for individuals to stay safe. \"Your safety is in your hands. Remember that if you remain safe, you are also keeping your family, neighbors, and the country safe,\" she said in an address to the nation.",
    " Title: Politicians' Temptation Towards Fiscal Binge: A Look at the Easy Way and the Responsible Way\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revealing account, former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, William Safire, recounted instances where he urged Nixon to take the easy way, only for the president to opt for the more difficult, righteous path. This anecdote serves as a stark reminder of the political landscape, where leaders often pretend to make tough decisions, but in reality, rarely follow through.\n\nThe current political climate is no exception. The failure to repeal Obamacare, for instance, is unlikely to inspire heroic deeds from politicians. Instead, the opposite may occur, leading to a fiscal binge that caters to the selfish interests of all, except future generations.\n\nCongressional Republicans might pass tax cuts, with Democrats potentially joining them in a big infrastructure bill. President Donald Trump's proposed spending cuts may amount to little or nothing, leading to a ballooning deficit, a situation that seems to concern few in Washington.\n\nRobert Bixby, executive director of The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog, comments, \"There's a political logic to it: 'You get what you want. We get what we want. And the future will pay for it.'\" Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, echoes this sentiment, stating, \"The risk of irresponsibility is high.\"\n\nWith the health care overhaul stalled, President Trump has indicated a shift towards tax reform. However, the prospect of a major revision of the Internal Revenue Code may prove as challenging as the health care debate. If a comprehensive overhaul proves elusive, Republicans may settle for tax cuts, leading to larger budget deficits, a default option they have pursued for decades.\n\nTrump's indifference towards the deficit means GOP members will face minimal resistance from him if they wish to cut rates, abolish the estate tax or the alternative minimum tax, or increase the standard deduction. House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposed border adjustment tax, which could offset the revenue lost from other changes, is unlikely to gain approval due to its potential to raise consumer prices and its complexity.\n\nPaying for tax cuts is unattractive because it would mean eliminating cherished tax breaks or curtailing outlays. Trump's proposed spending reductions, such as those targeting the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowment for the Arts, cannot be used to offset tax cuts, as the savings are earmarked for Trump's military buildup.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump's budget has little chance in Congress. Even fiscal conservatives who wish to cut spending do not necessarily advocate for slashing major domestic programs. The only significant areas where spending can be reduced are the entitlement programs\u2014Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. However, Trump, as a candidate, promised not to touch Social Security and Medicare, leaving Medicaid untouched.\n\nOn the contrary, Trump appears more inclined to boost outlays. He envisions a $1 trillion program aimed at revitalizing the country's infrastructure. This approach, reminiscent of Keynesian economics, could potentially garner bipartisan support. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has expressed interest in a 'big jobs bill' that includes corporate and middle-income tax cuts, as well as government spending to stimulate growth.\n\nHowever, this approach risks wasting money the country does not have, exacerbating the national debt, and burdening future generations. This is not the responsible way, but it is the easy way, a path that politicians are all too eager to take.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' Recent Decisions Spark Controversy, Shift in Court's Political Balance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent 5-4 decisions, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has emerged as a pivotal figure, demonstrating a shift in the court's political balance. This week, Roberts' role as the new swing vote has once again come to the forefront, as he sided with the court's conservative bloc in a school choice case, while aligning with the liberal members in a high-profile abortion case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Roberts joined the conservative justices in a decision that delivered a win for the school choice movement. However, on Monday, in the case of June Medical Services v. Russo, Roberts sided with the liberal members to rule against a Louisiana law restricting who can perform abortions, upholding precedent from a similar case in 2016. This decision followed his vote in rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to rescind DACA and his vote in a 6-3 decision that prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decisions have sparked strong reactions from both sides of the political aisle. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) praised Monday's ruling, while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) expressed concern about Roberts' alleged \"games\" with the court. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) celebrated Monday's ruling, while President Trump criticized the decisions as \"shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.\"\n\nRoberts' history of separating himself from the court's conservative contingent in key cases goes back years. In 2012, by siding with the liberal wing and reinterpreting an individual mandate as a tax, he allowed ObamaCare to be found constitutional. Last year, he joined with liberals again in shutting down the Trump administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the census.\n\nThe recent decisions have sparked concerns among some conservatives that Roberts is not even a swing vote, but has gone full liberal. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Fox News contributor Dan Bongino are among those who have expressed this view. However, statistics compiled by SCOTUSBlog show that Roberts has sided with the liberal justices in only three out of ten 5-4 decisions where all four liberal justices voted together during the court's October 2018 term.\n\nThe Supreme Court still has nearly a dozen cases left to decide this term, with several having significant political implications. Their issues include whether states can force members of the Electoral College to vote in accordance with the state's popular vote, and whether President Trump's tax returns can be released to House committees or Manhattan prosecutors. The court's decisions in these cases will likely further illuminate Roberts' role as the new swing vote.",
    " Title: \"The Threat to Free Speech in Times of Crisis: A Global Concern Amidst the Coronavirus Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of global crises, liberal democratic institutions and values are under threat, with authoritarian power grabs becoming increasingly common. One of the first casualties in this power struggle is freedom of speech, a fundamental right that is being undermined in various parts of the world, particularly during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe current attack on free speech is noteworthy because it is not only targeting \"fake news\" related to the coronavirus, but also the critique of inadequacies in healthcare systems by healthcare workers themselves. This dual-pronged approach is a cause for concern, as it stifles the flow of accurate information and hinders the efforts of those on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.\n\nThe term \"fake news\" gained prominence during the 2016 US presidential elections, leading to a frenzy of debate and action against its spread. However, the actual impact of \"fake news\" and \"Russian interference\" remains unclear and highly disputed. Despite this, many mainstream politicians have used these concerns as a pretext to justify their losses in elections to populists.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation, social media platforms are under pressure to \"fight fake news,\" and a burgeoning industry of fact-checkers has emerged. However, the progress made in this area is minimal, given the constant barrage of fake news emanating from some of the most powerful political offices in the world, including Downing Street and the White House.\n\nPopulists in power have eagerly embraced the fight against \"fake news,\" and the coronavirus crisis has provided them with an opportunity to intensify this fight by passing draconian new laws. One of the most egregious examples of this comes from Hungary, where the parliament, in a rush to pass \"emergency measures\" (as of 31 March, Hungary had only 492 cases, including 16 deaths), has granted far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \"dictatorial powers.\" Under these measures, anything deemed \"fake news\" will be punishable by up to five years in prison \u2013 a death sentence for independent media, insofar as it still exists in Hungary.\n\nAn even more dangerous attack on free speech is the suppression of the voices of healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus. These individuals are the most informed about the situation and, thus, the best potential antidotes to fake news. Yet, in several countries, including the UK and the US, healthcare workers are being silenced, with some being threatened with termination if they speak out about the lack of protective equipment.\n\nCensoring healthcare professionals is not only a violation of their rights but also a threat to the broader community. These are the people who risk their lives daily to help others, particularly if their employers do not provide them with adequate protective gear.\n\nFree speech is crucial in times of crisis, as it ensures that citizens are informed and can make informed decisions about their health and safety. The irony lies in the fact that some of the same politicians who support, or at least allow, the censorship of healthcare professionals in their own countries have been vocal critics of the Chinese approach. For instance, British cabinet minister Michael Gove recently blamed China for failing to stop the spread of coronavirus, while Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, called China's response \"one of the worst cover-ups in human history.\"\n\nTo avoid repeating the mistakes of China and to protect the health and lives of the heroic healthcare workers who are risking their lives daily to keep us safe, it is essential to resist these attacks on free speech, as well as other unnecessary authoritarian measures in response to the coronavirus crisis. Free speech makes us more, not less, safe, both as citizens and patients, even in times of a health crisis.",
    " Title: Early Presidential Bid: Ted Cruz Steps into the Spotlight as First Major Republican Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz has made a bold move in the 2016 presidential race, announcing his candidacy earlier than most of his potential Republican competitors. This move, characteristic of Cruz's unconventional and assertive style, is a strategic decision that sets him apart from the growing field of candidates.\n\nCruz, who officially declared his presidential bid in a midnight tweet and video, has not been the frontrunner in the party's 2016 discussions, nor has he been the media's focus. However, Cruz remains a charismatic figure on the campaign trail and could potentially shake up the presidential race. Although he is not among the leaders in national polls of Republicans, he has a strong appeal to the party's base voters, who are crucial in primaries, particularly in red states.\n\nHere are five reasons why Cruz's early entry into the race could be advantageous:\n\n1. Cutting through the noise: With an expanding Republican field, Cruz needs to stand out. By being the first major candidate to declare, Cruz offers the media a relatively fresh face to focus on, helping him cut through the confusion created by the growing number of potential candidates.\n\n2. Fundraising: Cruz's biggest challenge at the moment is fundraising. By launching a full-fledged campaign, Cruz can begin raising money more effectively. Cruz's home state of Texas is a significant source of political donations, but he faces competition from former Governor Rick Perry, who has been aggressive in securing oil money and other wealthy donors in the state.\n\n3. Skipping the exploratory committee phase: By foregoing the exploratory committee phase, Cruz avoids the usual pre-campaign formalities that can confuse voters and the media. Cruz's early declaration also reinforces his image as a straightforward candidate who calls things by their right names.\n\n4. Establishing himself as a conservative standard-bearer: Cruz's early entry into the race helps him position himself as the leading voice for the party's conservative activists. With many potential candidates vying for the same conservative base, Cruz's early declaration may discourage some of his natural rivals and eclipse smaller candidates.\n\n5. Maximizing media exposure: By entering the race early, Cruz can test the market and maximize his media exposure. Although not all media attention will be positive, Cruz thrives on attacks and uses them to bolster his image as a crusader for the cause. Cruz's long-shot candidacy could potentially last through the first few primaries, allowing him to return as a potential running mate at the convention.\n\nIn the end, Cruz's early entry into the race could prove to be a shrewd move, allowing him to establish himself as a serious contender and secure a strong position in the Republican primary race.",
    " Title: \"The Urgent Need for Nuanced Political Discourse in a Divided America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a contentious election, it is crucial to remember that people, and voters, are more complex than labels. The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre once described modern politics as \"civil war carried on by other means.\" This description rings true as political disagreements in the United States are often settled with words rather than violence. However, the nature of the recent election and the subsequent reactions have raised concerns about a potential darker period of division.\n\nThe urgent question in the background of every transition of power, but foregrounded with this one, is whether we will continue with politics as \"civil war carried on by other means\" or lapse into a much bleaker alternative. There are a number of troubling signs - flaring in post-election protests and now manifested in bombastic rhetoric - that we're inching toward a darker period of division.\n\nThe nature of Donald Trump's campaign has raised the stakes. However, some of the reaction to Trump, which includes cathartic rants pledging \"resistance at every turn,\" insisting \"there's no such thing as a good Trump voter,\" and equating critiques of identity politics with endorsements of white nationalism, has also contributed to the escalating tension. The more zero-sum we make our politics, the more self-righteous we become with our own beliefs. The more we cast our fellow citizens as beyond the pale of society, the less likely we will be able to maintain a modest unity.\n\nNone of this is meant as a defense of Trump. His cruelty toward women, African Americans, immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans, and the disabled (among others) has deeply harmed our civic aspirations. He will enter the office as the least qualified person ever to hold it. And since the election, his erratic Twitter diplomacy, eggshell reactions to late-night comedy, and undisciplined remarks have done little to assuage skeptics of his judgment and temperament.\n\nThese are not normal times, and Trump is not a normal leader. It is not surprising that some people in this country hope he will fail. But those who hold that view had better hope he fails in the right way. Some failures weaken political power and sideline political agendas, and some result in international crises and catastrophic loss of life. Insisting \"he's not my president\" and excoriating anyone willing to work for him puts us on a path toward the wrong kind of failure.\n\nInstead of simply blaming others or pledging unqualified resistance, those of us uncomfortable with the state of the country and the prospects of a Trump administration might first look inward. Instead of denouncing this impending presidency out of hand, we could begin by asking concretely and individually how we should become more engaged in our politics.\n\nFor some of us, this will involve voicing dissent and monitoring from afar. For others, it will involve risky partnerships with those ascending to power. All of us could stand to extend a little grace to those who pursue either dissent or partnership for the sake of maintaining our modest unity. Those focused on dissent might recognize prudential limits to their posture, forgoing absolute resistance to publicly support sensible nominees who do not share all of their politics but who will help govern effectively.\n\nWe might also remember that not all of our political opponents are the face of evil, the belly of racism, or the pit of depravity. Critics of Trump rightly denounced his caricatures of \"the blacks\" (whom he seemed to think all live in \"the inner city\") and his unconscionable flirtation with a \"Muslim registry.\" But we should also question the elitist rage now targeting and demonizing \"working-class whites\" or \"white evangelicals,\" as though the responsibility for the fate of the country now rests solely with some category of people constructed by exit polls.\n\nAnyone still confident that \"those people\" are the proximate cause of Trump's victory might think more carefully about the 28% of Latino voters or the 13% of black male voters who cast their ballots for Trump. Or spend a few minutes reading interviews with Trump voters. Resist the urge to read only those stories that confirm your priors, and you'll encounter gay Millennial women, Muslim immigrants, and disabled veterans who voted for him. This election, like all elections, is a complicated story.\n\nThe more we neglect political nuance and the more we simply blame \"those people\" for the current state of affairs, the less likely we are to see in others a shared humanity, to say nothing of a shared project of self-governance. For the sake of our modest unity, we can do better. We must do better.\n\nWe must remind ourselves that people - and voters - are more complex than labels. We must speak, write, and tweet with care, depth, and nuance. We must avoid the lazy thinking that encourages stereotyping. We might also try to listen to what \"those people\" have to say. Too often, we expect them to hear what we have to say without bothering to return the favor.\n\nAlong the way, we might come to see that \"those people\" are \"our people,\" too. And that politics, as MacIntyre reminds us, is still far preferable to the alternative. John Inazu is the Sally D.

    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Seeks Full Scope of Mueller's Russia Investigation from Justice Department\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at shedding light on the scope of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has requested a document detailing the full extent of the probe from the Justice Department.\n\nIn a letter sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on May 18, Grassley, an Iowa Republican, pointed out that Mueller's team recently provided an unredacted copy of the memo, which Rosenstein wrote on Aug. 2, 2017, to Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman who is currently indicted for bank and tax fraud related to his work in Ukraine.\n\nGrassley argued that Congress, like the Judiciary, is a separate branch of government with its own constitutional duties that often require access to Executive Branch information. He stated that the interests of the committee relate to both legislative and oversight responsibilities.\n\nMueller's team has argued that the special counsel did not have the jurisdiction to investigate areas not related to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. Manafort's lawyers have also questioned the timing of the memo, which Rosenstein wrote nearly three months after Mueller was appointed special counsel.\n\nGrassley also expressed interest in the timing of the Rosenstein memo, asking, \"The August Memorandum states that it addresses the special counsel's authorization as of the date he was appointed. Why was this memorandum not drafted until August 2017?\"\n\nGrassley has been a supporter of the Mueller investigation, the committee chairman noted. He has publicly warned President Trump against taking steps to shut down the investigation or fire Mueller.\n\n\"As I have said numerous times, that investigation should be free to follow the facts wherever they lead without any improper outside interference. However, that does not mean that it is immune from oversight or that information about the scope of its authority under existing Department regulations should be withheld from Congress,\" Grassley said.",
    " Title: Crowdfunding Campaign Launched to Defeat Sen. Susan Collins in 2020 Election Following Kavanaugh Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Sen. Susan Collins' announcement on Friday that she would vote \"yes\" on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh likely ended the uncertainty over his confirmation. However, her decision has sparked a significant response from individuals who are angry over her decision, with a crowdfunding campaign launched to defeat Collins in her 2020 election.\n\nMore than $50,000 was donated during her nearly 45-minute speech, bringing the total raised on the online crowdfunding campaign to defeat Collins in her 2020 election to more than $3 million as of 7 p.m. The campaign by three activist groups, Be A Hero Team, Maine People's Alliance, and Mainers for Accountable Leadership, had been criticized by Collins and others over several weeks as a possible attempt to bribe Collins into voting against Kavanaugh.\n\nThe donation page, titled \"Either Sen. Collins VOTES NO on Kavanaugh OR we fund her future opponent,\" went down briefly on crowdfunding website crowdpac.com Friday afternoon due to \"overwhelming\" traffic to the page, Be a Hero said in a statement. The groups are also raising money on the website ActBlue and say in total, between the two, the amount has topped $3 million. The groups say donations are coming in every three seconds.\n\nThe page states that those donating will not be charged if Collins votes no on Kavanaugh. However, Collins seemingly put an end to the uncertainty, giving a nearly 45-minute speech on the Senate floor that explained her process and why she'd be voting to confirm him.\n\n\"Susan Collins has betrayed the people, and especially the women and survivors, of Maine,\" the campaign organizers said in a statement. \"Thousands of Mainers wrote, called, visited, protested, begged, and pleaded with Susan Collins to do the right thing - to be a hero - and vote no. She ignored them.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"For years she has claimed to be an independent, a different kind of Republican, but today she shattered that facade forever. Her vote will reverberate long after she has left the Senate.\"\n\nThe organizers said they were committed to defeating Collins in 2020 and pledged to \"never let her forget\" this decision.\n\n\"Maine deserves a Senator who would recoil at the idea of confirming a proven liar, an emotionally unstable partisan, to the Supreme Court,\" the statement said. \"Maine deserves a Senator who will believe survivors, who will listen to their stories, and who will represent them with honor. Susan Collins is no longer capable of that.\"\n\nDuring her speech on the floor, Collins went through the issues, from Obamacare, same-sex marriage, and abortion rights, and said Kavanaugh's record and pledges before Congress were enough to keep her vote. She said Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens, offered a compelling testimony before Congress, but ultimately no one could vouch for her claims or even remember the party.\n\nCollins said the allegations, in her eyes, \"fail to meet the'more likely than not' \" standard. She said she believes voting against Kavanaugh without witnesses or proof could start a \"dangerous\" precedent.\n\n\"I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court,\" Collins said, adding that her decision should not be \"misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country.\"\n\nA watchdog group has asked the Justice Department to investigate the campaign against Collins out of concern the money donated was an attempt to bribe Collins' vote and called it illegal.",
    " Title: U.S. Continues to Experience Attacks by Iran-Backed Militias in Iraq, According to Senior U.S. Officials\n\nIn the aftermath of the U.S. strike that resulted in the death of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Iran-backed militias in Iraq have reportedly scaled down their attacks on American outposts but continue to launch strikes, according to James Jeffrey, the Trump administration's special representative for Syria engagement and special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nDuring a briefing, Jeffrey informed reporters that the U.S. has experienced a few shellings of coalition bases where American forces are located. He added that, with the exception of several incidents at the American embassy compound a few days ago, these attacks have been intermittent and similar to what the U.S. has experienced in their years in Iraq.\n\nWhen asked if these attacks have been orchestrated by Iran, Jeffrey responded, \"We think so.\"\n\nThe U.S., while still engaged in the fight against the ISIS terror group in Iraq, remains primarily focused on protecting American forces in the region from retaliatory strikes by Iran. \"The focus of our forces right now is force protection,\" Jeffrey said. \"They suffered first 11 quite serious attacks from Iranian-supported militias, who are by and large parts of the Iraqi security system, then the assault on the embassy, then the two Iranian long-range intermediate missile strikes on our forces in Erbil and Ayn al-Asad. So in a situation like that, obviously, the commanders are going to focus, as they have so successfully, on force protection. And as the threat diminishes, they\u2019ll review that.\"\n\nIn addition to the threat posed by Iran, U.S. officials remain concerned about the potential resurgence of ISIS following major territorial defeats in the past year. \"The risk of the resurgence of ISIS is a very big problem,\" Jeffrey said. \"We have emphasized that ever since the physical caliphate was defeated along the Euphrates in March of last year. We are very concerned about the number of forces there and how they coordinate among each other. The Iraqis are concerned about that. Our SDF partners in northeast Syria are concerned about that. The Turks are concerned about that because they now have forces in the northeast. Everyone is looking into this and watching it closely.\"",
    " Title: Dr. Rick Bright Warns of Potential Darkest Winter in Modern History Amidst Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee on Thursday, Dr. Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), warned that the United States needs to take immediate action to control the coronavirus pandemic and avoid a disastrous second wave of infections this winter.\n\nBright, who was removed from his post last month, cautioned that the coming winter could be the darkest in recent history without proper planning and quick action. He urged the need for widespread testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, while striving to develop a cure.\n\n\"Our window of opportunity is closing,\" Bright said. \"I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged. Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.\"\n\nBright also expressed his belief that a Covid-19 vaccine is a question of when, not if, but warned that the 12 to 18-month timeline for manufacturing a vaccine is aggressive and may take longer.\n\nIn his testimony, Bright accused HHS leadership of being dismissive, ignoring his warnings as early as January to ramp up production of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and testing swabs in anticipation of a pandemic. He also claimed that he was sidelined from key high-level meetings to combat COVID-19 and was removed from his position in retaliation for resisting the White House's push to promote hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus remedy.\n\nBright's testimony comes after he filed a whistleblower complaint in April, alleging that he was removed from the top BARDA job for resisting the White House's push to promote hydroxychloroquine. The Office of the Special Counsel has since concluded that there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that Bright was retaliated against and should be reinstated to his former job as BARDA director.\n\nDuring the hearing, Republicans on the committee focused more on defending President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine than on getting to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding Bright's removal. Some Republicans attacked Bright, with Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) suggesting that Bright was trying to \"deceive the American people\" by taking a medical leave for hypertension, and Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) attempting to spin Bright's criticism of HHS leadership as an attack on Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nMeanwhile, during a Q&A with reporters ahead of Trump's trip to Pennsylvania, administration officials tried to undercut Bright's testimony by attacking him. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, \"While we are launching Operation Warp Speed, he is not showing up for work.\"\n\nEvery day, \u2588\u2588\u2588 aims to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

    " Title: Trump's Decision on DACA: A Six-Month Delay and a Controversial Compromise\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program over a six-month period has been met with a mixed response, failing to satisfy both supporters and critics of the policy. The DACA program, which allows certain individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to remain in the country, has been a contentious issue this year, second only to the climate change agreement in terms of media coverage.\n\nThe media has been critical of Trump's decision, with many journalists expressing disappointment that the president is ending a program that has become an integral part of American society. The climate change agreement, on the other hand, is more abstract, making the DACA issue more personal and emotionally charged.\n\nDespite some speculation that Trump might leave the program untouched, the president had promised to end it during his campaign. However, the DACA program enjoys wide public support, as the individuals in question had no control over being brought to America, and prominent Republicans such as Paul Ryan and Orrin Hatch have called for its preservation. Major business and tech leaders have also voiced their support for the program.\n\nThe media has focused on the individual stories of DACA recipients, highlighting their achievements, family lives, and contributions to society. This approach serves to evoke sympathy for those who may be affected by the program's termination.\n\nPresident Trump, in having Attorney General Jeff Sessions make the announcement, appears to have aimed to limit potential backlash. Trump has shown ambivalence towards the DACA program, having previously expressed support for its recipients. In 2011, he stated, \"You have people in this country for 20 years: They\u2019ve done a great job, they\u2019ve done wonderfully, they\u2019ve gone to school, they\u2019ve gotten good marks, they\u2019re productive. Now we\u2019re supposed to send them out of the country? I don\u2019t believe in that.\"\n\nAttorney General Sessions, a known anti-illegal immigration advocate, announced the \"rescinding\" of the DACA program on constitutional grounds. Sessions emphasized that the uproar over the program's creation was largely due to its unilateral nature, as it was implemented by executive order during the 2012 campaign when President Obama could not secure congressional approval.\n\nMany pundits view the six-month delay as Trump passing the decision to Congress. However, the administration is immediately halting any new applications. According to a senior White House aide, if Republican lawmakers fail to act, Trump may not follow through on terminating DACA. This could set up a potential conflict between the president and Steve Bannon, who has returned to Breitbart and remains an influential voice.\n\nWhile Republicans are divided, the Democrats are increasing pressure, with Nancy Pelosi stating that Trump is ready to \"break the hearts and offend the morals of all who believe in justice and human dignity.\" The possibility of Congress rescuing the program within the next six months may be optimistic, given the current political climate and the gridlock in Congress.\n\nIn an ideal system, the president and Congress would link the debate over DACA to a broader approach on immigration reform, including the proposed border wall. However, the current political climate and the history of gridlock in Washington make such a resolution unlikely.",
    " Title: Immigrant Rights Activists Converge on Capitol Hill for Rally, Demanding Swift Action on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nTens of thousands of immigrant rights supporters will gather on Wednesday on Capitol Hill, aiming to pressure lawmakers to act swiftly on immigration reform. The rally comes at a critical juncture in the ongoing debate, as negotiators are grappling with the intricacies of drafting legislation. The demonstration is a response to the daily deportation of approximately 1,100 immigrants, a figure that activists argue underscores the urgency of the situation.\n\nSimilar protests have taken place in 2003, 2006, and 2010, marking the growing immigrant rights movement in the United States. This year, protesters will traverse the halls of the Capitol to lobby their representatives before assembling on the West Lawn to demonstrate the political clout they have cultivated since 2012.\n\nGustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, an advocacy group organizing the rally, stated, \"We have been here before. But this time is different. We are different. Washington is different. Politicians learned their lesson this past election cycle.\"\n\nThe immediate objective of the marchers is to spur Senate and House negotiators to finalize the details of legislation that would legalize the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., revise the system for future legal immigrants, and strengthen border and interior enforcement.\n\nActivists will advocate for a straightforward and expedient legalization process, arguing that there is no need for additional border security measures or increased deportations.\n\nThe rally on Wednesday also serves to underscore the growing political influence of a movement that has been on the rise for years, but has only recently compelled lawmakers to take notice following the 2012 elections. Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, expressed optimism, stating, \"Our vote, along with the stars aligning in our favor in Congress, leads us to be very optimistic about the impact our presence in D.C. will have this week.\"\n\nActivists have expressed similar hopes for over a decade, taking to the streets and parks to stage mass demonstrations that highlighted the growing power of their movement, which is intrinsically linked to the growth of Hispanic voters.\n\nIn 2003, with the Bush administration distancing itself from immigration reform following the September 11 terrorist attacks, activists organized the Immigrant Worker Freedom Rides, during which hundreds of immigrants traveled from city to city to advocate for legalization. This marked a key early test of the emerging coalition, as religious leaders, labor unions, and minority rights activists united to bolster immigrant rights groups.\n\nMassive marches in the spring of 2006 drew national attention, as up to 5 million supporters turned out in cities across the nation to protest a House Republican bill that aimed to crack down on illegal immigration and impose penalties on those aiding illegal immigrants. The rallies gained notoriety for their size, including an estimated 500,000 at a Los Angeles rally on March 25. However, they also generated negative publicity after some participants carried foreign flags, particularly Mexican flags, sparking a backlash among voters.\n\nDouglas Rivlin, who worked for the National Immigration Forum at the time, noted that these rallies served as a first glimpse of the movement's power for many Americans. \"The marches, just as the debate, probably hardened some positions on each side, but I think for the vast majority in the middle, there was an awakening that there was this huge issue out there they hadn't paid much attention to,\" said Mr. Rivlin, who now works for Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, one of the movement's leaders.\n\nIndeed, it was soon after the 2006 marches that senators reached a deal on a legalization bill and brought it to the Senate floor, where it passed 62-36. However, they were unable to reconcile their broad legalization bill with the House Republicans' crackdown bill. A year later, senators attempted to pass the bill again, only to see it fall to a bipartisan filibuster.\n\nThe issue simmered, serving as a dividing line in the 2008 election, with then-candidate Barack Obama promising to make immigration a top priority in his first year in the White House. Mr. Obama won the election but turned instead to health care, angering Hispanic voters who felt betrayed. The anger was exacerbated by the president's push to increase deportations.\n\nIn 2010, activists staged another mass rally\u2014this time on the Mall in Washington, where many had harsh words for Mr. Obama. \"It was an important moment in sending the signal to Democrats again that this was an issue that was not going away, and kept the pressure on Democrats to deal with immigration in 2010,\" Mr. Rivlin said.\n\nWary of losing Hispanic voters in 2012, Mr. Obama granted tentative legal status to most young adult illegal immigrants last year\u2014something he had for years said he lacked the authority to do. The president also vowed that if he was re-elected, he would renew his efforts to pass a broad legalization bill.\n\nNow, activists say that promise is due, and the rally on Wednesday will serve as a reminder of the power the movement can bring. \"This is a point of escalation, and the show of force in my mind is the overall effort that began the day after the election in 2012,\" said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which is helping organize the rally.\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, which advocates for legalization from the conservative side, stated that the rallies have served a purpose, but they work best when they target both sides. He suggested that means being willing to criticize Mr. Obama on enforcement as well as Republicans who oppose legalization, and pushing for action on all aspects of the immigration equation, including a guest-worker program for future foreign workers. \"Put pressure on both sides,\" he said. \"Put pressure on Republicans, but put pressure on Obama as well.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Call for Lethal U.S. Arms to Ukraine: A Bold Bipartisan Move to Counter Russian Aggression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant bipartisan move, House Speaker John A. Boehner and top Democrats and Republicans on key security committees have urged President Obama to authorize the transfer of lethal American arms to Ukraine. The lawmakers, in a letter sent Thursday, assert that Congress has already granted the president the necessary authority, and they emphasize the urgency of taking action to halt Russian aggression.\n\nThe bipartisan group, which includes the ranking Democrats on the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence committees, contends that Ukraine represents a major geopolitical test for the U.S., one that is in danger of being lost. The lawmakers argue that the situation in Ukraine is not merely a component of a Russian strategy to redraw borders or impose its will on neighboring countries, but a violation of international law, a challenge to the West, and an assault on the post-World War II international order.\n\nCongress passed a law last year permitting the transfer of defensive military equipment to Ukraine, and the Ukrainian government has recently provided the Pentagon and President Obama's national security staff with a list of military equipment they require. However, despite having the necessary authorization, the president has yet to act on the matter.\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden spoke with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Thursday, expressing concern over continued separatist attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilian areas, despite a ceasefire agreement in place. The White House stated that the two leaders also discussed the need for a clearer overall strategy to address the situation in Ukraine.\n\nThe lawmakers argue that the ceasefire, as it currently stands, has allowed Russian-backed separatists to consolidate their positions and push Ukrainian forces out of the territory. They urge President Obama to act swiftly in providing lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe members of Congress acknowledge President Obama's desire to work in concert with Europe, but they express concern that the president's approach has not been effective in leading European heads of state to the right conclusions. They urge the president to take a more assertive role in challenging Russian aggression and to avoid being held hostage by the lowest common denominator of European consensus.\n\nSome analysts have predicted that providing lethal arms to Ukraine may provoke a more emphatic response from Russia, which is backing separatists in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic. President Obama has been cautious in his approach, viewing his decision on arms as a delicate balancing act.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland testified before the House on Wednesday that the U.S. is providing significant non-lethal security support and defensive weapons to Ukraine. The issue, according to Nuland, is whether to increase the lethality of the aid, and whether such a move would serve to harden the situation or escalate it.\n\nPresident Obama's top military advisers, including Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, have weighed in favor of providing lethal aid to Ukraine. Dempsey stated that, while Russia could take Ukraine due to its geographic proximity and size, there are capability gaps that put Ukrainian forces at a disadvantage. He suggested that the U.S. should explore opportunities to provide the necessary capabilities to Ukraine to compete on a level playing field with Russia.\n\nThe stakes, according to the members of Congress, go beyond Ukraine and include the Baltic countries that are part of NATO. An attack on them would trigger NATO's collective defense pact, requiring all member countries to step up in defense.",
    " Title: AllSides Dictionary Aims to Bridge Political Divide with Controversial Term Definitions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the US presidential election, a new online dictionary, the AllSides Dictionary, has been introduced by AllSides, a news hub that offers guidance on the political bias of articles and news providers. The dictionary, which features contributions from academics, aims to provide balanced definitions of 400 controversial terms, revealing how they are perceived differently by people with various political perspectives.\n\nExamples of terms defined include \"abortion,\" \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"truth,\" and \"white privilege.\" Phil Neisser, one of the editors of the dictionary and a professor in the department of politics at the State University of New York at Potsdam, believes the dictionary offers a valuable opportunity for higher education institutions to help students become more well-rounded in their understanding of controversial topics.\n\n\"Universities today are, in some ways, places of potential conflict, because people who have been in their different bubbles \u2013 neighborhoods [ and ] high schools \u2013 come together,\" Neisser said. \"University is an opportunity to build mutual understanding in society \u2013 use the setting to get people to sit down and listen [ and ] talk to people very different from them, and who disagree with them.\"\n\nMikhail Lyubansky, another contributor on the project and a teaching associate professor in the department of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also sees the dictionary as a means to encourage students to think differently.\n\n\"I teach a course on race, and one of the things I want my students to get out of that course is the ability to understand the positionality of people who think differently, who understand the race-related ideas differently than they do,\" Lyubansky said.\n\nThe AllSides Dictionary is intended to foster understanding and promote dialogue by offering multiple perspectives on controversial terms. As Neisser noted, the dictionary \"should be something that grows.\" He emphasized that the dictionary is incomplete and will need to evolve with the political times.\n\nProfessor Neisser and Professor Lyubansky shared their insights on defining terms in the AllSides Dictionary. Neisser, who wrote the entry on equality, discussed the challenges he faced in finding the right words to describe viewpoints that are not his own. Lyubansky, who wrote the entry on abortion, highlighted the importance of capturing the spirit and nuance of each political orientation in the dictionary.\n\nThe AllSides Dictionary represents an effort to promote understanding and dialogue in a politically divided society. By offering balanced definitions of controversial terms, the dictionary aims to encourage students and readers to engage in thoughtful, informed discussions about the issues that divide us.",
    " Title: Understanding the QAnon Conspiracy Theory: A Deep Dive into the Beliefs of President Trump's Base\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, a peculiar and complex conspiracy theory known as QAnon has gained traction among a segment of President Trump's supporters. This theory, centered around anonymous posts on 4Chan and 8Chan internet message boards under the pseudonym \"Q,\" posits that a high-ranking government official, known as Q, is on the verge of exposing a cabal of pedophiles, globalists, and celebrities who secretly control America.\n\nThe theory, often described as a parallel history, is characterized by its enigmatic nature, with Q's posts reading like riddles. YouTube videos created by QAnon believers help fill in the gaps, creating a narrative that is more-or-less comprehensible.\n\nAt the heart of the theory is the belief that a \"deep state\" took over America decades ago. This all-encompassing theory seeks to explain various events, from the JFK assassination to the prevalence of mass shootings and the rise of ISIS, as part of this secret government.\n\nAdherents of QAnon believe that President Kennedy was set to reveal the existence of the secret government when he was assassinated. They also believe President Reagan was shot on the deep state's orders, and that all the presidents since he left office, with the exception of President Trump, have been deep state agents.\n\nThe military, according to the theory, recruited President Trump to run for president, and the deep state, which controls the media, tried to smear him through \"fake news\" and unfounded allegations of collusion with Russia. Despite these efforts, Mr. Trump is winning, and the deep state's leaders are expected to be arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay in an event known as \"The Storm.\"\n\nIn QAnon lore, President Trump is secretly working with special counsel Robert Mueller to bring the deep state down, and \"The Storm\" is a kind of Judgment Day in which the evildoers are punished and the faithful are redeemed. Q has repeatedly suggested that \"The Storm\" would hit in the very near future, and has even said certain people would be arrested at specific dates.\n\nThe posts from Q are often vague or incomprehensible, but QAnon fans are eager to decipher them. Last year, for example, Q posted a photo of an unnamed island chain. Eager to divine the reasoning behind the post, QAnon adherents tried to prove that the photo must have been taken on Air Force One, which in turn meant that Q was traveling with the president.\n\nThe Q posts are known to the faithful as \"breadcrumbs.\" The people who then try to figure out what they mean are called \"bakers.\" According to The Daily Beast's Will Sommer, QAnon adherents also spend a lot of time trying to figure out who in the government is a \"white hat\" Trump supporter and who is a \"black hat\" in league with the deep state. Their rallying cry is \"where we go one, we go all,\" a line from the 1996 Jeff Bridges sailing adventure \"White Squall\" that they misattribute to President Kennedy.\n\nThe phrase is frequently abbreviated to \"WWG1WGA,\" which Roseanne Barr, one of several celebrity QAnon promoters, tweeted in June. Former Red Sox pitcher and current right-wing radio host Curt Schilling has also promoted QAnon online.\n\nThe name \"Q\" refers to Q-level clearance at the Energy Department. However, the identity of the person behind the posts remains a mystery. According to Sommer, the QAnon faithful sometimes point to former national security adviser Michael Flynn and White House aide Dan Scavino as possibilities. Others believe it's Mr. Trump himself. Another theory is that John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his death and now posts on 8Chan as QAnon.",
    " Title: Congressional Impasse Leads to Government Shutdown as Obama Criticizes Republican Tactics Over Health Care Law\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the U.S. government has entered a shutdown phase as Congressional Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse over the funding of the government and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama, in a Rose Garden address today, accused Republicans of using the government funding as a bargaining chip to alter the health care law that was passed in 2010. He was flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and beneficiaries of the health care law's new provisions.\n\n\"They're shutting down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health care to many Americans,\" Obama said. \"They are demanding ransom just for doing their job.\" He added, \"This Republican shutdown did not have to happen.\"\n\nThe statement comes after Obama met with 12 individuals who have either benefited from the Affordable Care Act's changes to health insurance coverage or plan to enroll in coverage through the new insurance marketplaces that came online today.\n\nObama criticized Republicans for making the dismantling of the health care law the \"centerpiece of their agenda,\" and he urged them to pass a budget and end the government shutdown. \"I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions,\" Obama said. \"I will not negotiate over Congress' ability to pay bills it's already racked up.\"\n\nWith the next, potentially disastrous deadline right around the corner, the president urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling, warning, \"It'd be far more dangerous than a government shutdown, as bad as a shutdown is; it would be an economic shutdown.\"\n\nOn the first day of the health insurance marketplaces' opening to accept new enrollment, Obama acknowledged that the online system was experiencing \"glitches\" that he attributed to unexpected high demand. \"More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning,\" Obama said. \"We're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle this demand exceeding anything we expected.\"\n\nComparing the initial problems to issues with Apple's rollout of a new operating system, Obama added, \"I don't remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads.\"\n\nHowever, on Capitol Hill, both Houses of Congress reinforced their original positions today despite a government shutdown that left nearly 800,000 federal employees out of work without pay this morning, and more than a million other \"essential\" employees on the job with many of their paychecks delayed.\n\nWith national parks and war memorials closed, House Republicans are now looking for ways to blunt the shutdown's damage, one politically sensitive part of the government at a time. They plan to approve smaller spending bills that would fully fund veterans programs, the National Park Service, and the District of Columbia.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected the strategy on the Senate floor this afternoon. \"Just another wacky idea from the Tea Party-driven Republicans,\" Reid said. \"We cannot and we won't be forced to choose between the parks and cancer research.\"\n\nBut Republicans say Democrats are the ones who refuse to negotiate over funding the government as previous presidents and Congresses have in the past. \"Democratic leaders in Congress finally have their prize, a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.\n\nRepublicans held late-night votes in the House of Representatives in the early hours this morning to reaffirm their demands that the Democratic Senate agree to undermine President Obama's health care law in exchange for funding the government and that the Senate appoint representatives to a conference committee on the budget.\n\nDemocrats, in turn, gaveled the Senate into session this morning only to reject the House's bill, and Democratic leaders say they will only pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached. Meanwhile, with the stroke of midnight, the Affordable Care Act's health exchanges opened for business, allowing the uninsured to purchase health insurance.\n\nThe impact of the shutdown, however, is being felt in other ways. National parks in Washington and across the country are closed to the public, and much of the government will be operating at reduced staffing levels that will lead to widespread delay. People seeking Federal Housing Administration home loans will have to wait until the shutdown ends to secure mortgages. And in Washington, the courts have stopped issuing marriage licenses and performing weddings.\n\nThe political consequences could be grave for both parties in Congress, but especially for Republicans. According to an ABC-Washington Post poll released Monday, 63 percent say they disapprove of Republicans' handling of the budget debate compared to 50 percent who disapprove of Obama's handling of the situation.\n\n\"The question is how fast does public pressure grow, particularly on Republicans,\" said Sarah Binder, an expert in Congress and legislative politics and a professor at George Washington University. \"There are federal employees everywhere.\"\n\n\"We underestimate some of the networks within which lawmakers will find themselves back home.\"",
    " Title: \"American Sniper's Depiction of Chris Kyle: A Reflection of a Broader Political Narrative\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent controversy surrounding the biopic \"American Sniper,\" it is not just the portrayal of Chris Kyle that has come under scrutiny, but also the larger issues that the film represents. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, has been criticized for sugarcoating Kyle's image and for its myopic view of the Iraq War.\n\nTwo key events in Eastwood's public appearances shed light on the troubling ways he represents a dark, disturbing feature of the GOP mind-set. In 2005, at the National Board of Review dinner, Eastwood threatened filmmaker Michael Moore, stating that he would kill him if Moore showed up at his door with a camera. This response was to Moore's documentary \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" which raised important conversations about U.S. gun culture.\n\nIn 2012, at the Republican National Convention, Eastwood delivered a bizarre, rambling monologue to an empty chair, supposedly representing an invisible Barack Obama. This performance, described as the weirdest moment of the RNC, suggested that Obama was swearing at him and cursing at Mitt Romney.\n\nThese two events, taken together, help explain what's wrong with \"American Sniper.\" They illustrate the combination of delusion and aggressive violence that governs too much of GOP politics.\n\nThe film draws a direct link between the events of 9/11 and the war in Iraq, forgetting completely that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. This connection is delusional, as not one of the 9/11 attackers was in any way connected to Iraq.\n\nThe second problem is the culture of violence. The film portrays Kyle wrestling with some of his kills, but he still divides the world into categories: wolves (those who want to kill you), sheep, and sheep dogs (who have to protect the sheep from the wolves). This simplistic worldview, where Iraqis are almost always depicted as wolves, is troubling.\n\n\"American Sniper\" lacks nuance, context, and subtlety, a reflection of a GOP mind-set that couples delusion with violence. The film is not just about a sniper, but also about an attitude that threatens to destroy any chance in our nation for political compromise and productive debate. This is what makes this movie truly disturbing.",
    " Title: National and State Polls Show Romney Leading Obama in Final Days Before Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third and final 2012 presidential debate approaches, the race between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney tightens, with Romney leading in both national and critical battleground states. Here's a look at some of the latest polling data:\n\n1. Rasmussen and Gallup: Both Rasmussen and Gallup daily tracking polls show Romney in the lead among likely voters. Rasmussen's latest poll gives Romney a two-point edge (49% to 47%), while Gallup shows a larger margin (51% to 45%). Romney has held a lead of more than five points in this poll for over a week.\n\n2. NBC/WSJ: This national survey, which has been less favorable to Republicans in recent months, shows a 47% tie between the two candidates. Sitting at 47% two weeks out is not a position of strength for an incumbent president, according to NBC's Chuck Todd.\n\n3. Politico/GWU: Romney has taken the lead in this poll for the first time, with a one-point edge (49% to 47%). The partisan sample is D+4, which might overstate Democrats' turnout edge by a hair. In the poll's swing state sub-sample, Romney leads by the same margin, but hits the 50% mark.\n\n4. Monmouth University: Romney leads Obama by three points (48% to 45%) in this poll. Romney carries independents handily on every major question, with a 22-point favorability advantage over Obama.\n\nIn the Monmouth poll, Romney also leads among men, women without children, and older voters, while Obama leads among younger voters and women overall.\n\nFresh state polls also show a tight race in critical battleground states. In Colorado, Romney leads by five points (50% to 46%), in Iowa, the race is tied (47% to 47%), and in Ohio, Romney leads by two points (48% to 46%).\n\nWith nearly two weeks left until the election, Republicans have ample reason to be optimistic. However, the race remains close, and one never knows when the trajectory might shift again. Tonight's debate may present the president with his best shot at re-shuffling the deck.\n\nUPDATE: More red flags for Team Obama from the NBC/WSJ poll. A large majority of voters say that if Obama is re-elected, they want to see him dramatically alter his policies.\n\nUPDATE II: Another Ohio poll shows the race tied at 47% each.",
    " Title: American Missionary Among 28 Killed in Terrorist Attack in Burkina Faso's Capital\n\nAn American missionary, Mike Riddering, was among at least 28 people killed in a terrorist attack in the capital of Burkina Faso that ended on Saturday. The attack took place at the Hotel Splendid and the nearby Cappuccino Cafe, where the terrorists set fire to several cars.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Riddering, 45, had gone to the capital from the orphanage he and his wife Amy worked at in Yako, a town about 60 miles northwest of Ouagadougou. The attack also claimed the lives of six Canadians, two French, two Swiss, and a Dutch citizen, as reported by Reuters.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, Amy Boyle Riddering, Mike's wife, wrote, \"My best friend, partner in crime and love of my life. The best husband ever. An amazing father to his children and a papa to everyone. My heart is so heavy and I am having trouble believing he is gone. Mike was an example in the way he lived and loved.\"\n\nTwo of the attackers were women, according to President Roch Marc Christian Kabore, as reported by the Associated Press. Three of the terrorists, believed to belong to a local al-Qaeda affiliate, were killed in the assault on the Hotel Splendid. A fourth attacker was killed nearby at the Hotel Yibi.\n\nThe raid to end the siege was mounted after dozens of French special forces arrived overnight from neighboring Mali. One U.S. military member was embedded with French forces at the scene, and the United States was working to help provide France with surveillance and reconnaissance support, according to a U.S. senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe terrorist group known as AQIM, or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, claimed responsibility for the attack online as it was unfolding, according to SITE Intelligence Group. The group is believed to be responsible for a similar siege at an upscale hotel in Bamako, Mali, in November that left 20 dead.\n\nBurkina Faso, a largely Muslim country, has largely been spared the violence wracked by Islamic extremist groups in Mali. However, a Romanian national was abducted last April. The attacks follow growing tension in Burkina Faso in the wake of a coup attempt by presidential guards that collapsed in September. The newly installed government of President Kabore recently issued an arrest warrant for Guillaume Soro, the head of the National Assembly in neighboring Ivory Coast, for his alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt.\n\nIn a separate development, an Australian doctor and his wife were kidnapped on Friday night by extremists in Burkina Faso's north near its border with Mali. The couple was abducted in Djibo, the capital of the northern Soum province. The couple had been living in the region since 1972, volunteering in health services, a local journalist told the Associated Press.\n\nDenmark's Crown Princess Mary had been scheduled to visit Burkina Faso later this month on an official visit to visit women's rights and health groups. Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen said the country is assessing whether it will be safe for her to make the trip, according to the Associated Press.",
    " Title: Congressional Members Prioritize Media Appearances Over Governing Duties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark departure from their intended role, members of Congress are willingly forsaking their responsibilities in favor of television appearances on networks like MSNBC and Fox News. This shift away from governance towards performance art has been a growing trend, with the proliferation of technologies enabling transparency in politics.\n\nThe 21st century's transparency has had both positive and negative effects. The increased visibility of politics has led to a decline in actual governing, with the trades and compromises that entails, and a rise in grandstanding and posturing as brave truth-tellers condemning the \"dysfunction\" of their own institution.\n\nThis tendency among legislators to prioritize media exposure over legislative work is a significant contributor to the current state of political paralysis. Even with control of both chambers and a Republican president ready to sign any legislation they propose, the Republican Congress has achieved little beyond passing a tax cut. They have made no significant strides in areas they campaigned on for years, such as healthcare system reform, immigration law adjustments, or addressing the entitlement crisis.\n\nMoreover, the Congress, designed by the Founders to be the most powerful branch, is willingly surrendering its intended role for the fleeting pleasure of television appearances. This shift away from governance is an outcome that the Founders did not anticipate and is likely to outlast the current administration.\n\nThe president's penchant for strutting and howling, and his apparent disinterest in the mechanics and norms of governing, is well-documented. However, the Congress's willingness to abdicate their role in favor of media exposure is a concerning development that warrants attention. This trend, if unchecked, could further erode the effectiveness of the legislative branch and hinder the ability of Congress to carry out its constitutional duties.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Internal Dilemma Over Grand Bargain for Deficit Reduction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the three-day Conservative Political Action Convention, the Republican Party has shown a strong stance against President Obama's budgetary policies, emphasizing the need for deficit reduction. However, a closer look reveals that the GOP may not be as eager for a grand bargain as their rhetoric suggests.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a renowned political analyst, points out that the Republican Party is unified by the defining theme of fighting against deficits. Since the 2010 elections, deficit reduction has been a major theme for the party, serving as a common ground that holds together the various factions of the conservative movement.\n\nCongressman Paul Ryan, with an eye towards 2016, emphasized the importance of deficit reduction, stating, \"Our debt is a threat to this country. We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.\" However, for many reasons, Republicans do not seem to want a \"grand bargain\" over deficit reduction.\n\nDeficit reduction is an issue that the party likes to talk about more than they have an interest in actually tackling, according to Zelizer. If deficit reduction loses its salience as an issue due to a deal between the president and Congress, Republicans will have less to unite over and more time to fight among themselves.\n\nThe opportunity for President Obama is reminiscent of President Bill Clinton's success in 1996 when he signed onto a historic welfare reform bill, stealing away one of the main issues that the GOP had used to attack Democrats for decades. If President Obama were to enter into some kind of major budget deal and if the economy's recovery speeded up, thus bringing more revenue to the federal government, the president could potentially find himself like his predecessor in the late 1990s, when a Democratic president was able to move beyond existing political divisions while claiming the mantle of fiscal responsibility and potentially boast of short-term surpluses.\n\nHowever, a genuine deficit reduction deal would require Congress to accept some kind of revenue increase, which goes against the Republican Party's fiscal orthodoxy. Paul Ryan's proposals have come under intense criticism, with many economists saying that the numbers just don't add up. The political backlash from Republican voters against substantive cuts as proposed by Congressman Paul Ryan could be severe.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Republican Party is vocal about the need for deficit reduction, the political incentives point in a different direction. A grand bargain over deficit reduction could potentially lead to internal divisions within the party, as the GOP may not be willing to accept revenue increases or entitlement cuts that could lead to political blowback in red states.",
    " Title: Top Political Prospects Raise Over $86 Million Ahead of 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical outfits associated with the top 10 presidential prospects in both major parties have collectively raised at least $86 million for committees that could potentially support their campaigns, according to a recent analysis of campaign reports and interviews with political allies.\n\nThe early fundraising efforts are crucial in the Citizens United era, as prospective candidates need a stable of wealthy donors to support their campaigns before they officially announce their candidacy. This early money is being funneled into state and federal reelection campaign committees, leadership PACs, super PACs, and nonprofit groups created to boost pet causes.\n\nIn the Democratic camp, Hillary Clinton's allies have been the most active, with her shadow campaign raising more than $12 million in 2013 to build a voter database and grass-roots army. Billionaire currency trader George Soros, a significant donor, contributed $500,000 to the American Bridge super PAC in the last days of 2013, which is defending Clinton against Republican attacks.\n\nOn the Republican side, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is seeking funds from Texas Republicans at a Dallas fundraiser this week, while Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been courting donors like Foster Friess, who attended the State of the Union as Cruz's guest. Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Maryland GOP Gov. Martin O'Malley are also reportedly building their campaign-style operations and reaching out to wealthy donors.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nomination is widely considered Hillary Clinton's to take, given the extensive infrastructure that has been built around her without her involvement. The Republican side, however, is seeing a competitive race, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin raising significant funds through their various accounts.\n\nRubio and Ryan, favored by GOP establishment donors, raised $8 million and $4.8 million, respectively, last year. Both men spent heavily on digital operations and ads defending their political stances. Rubio spent $120,000 on ads defending Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, a potential key presidential endorser in the state's first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nSen. Cruz, a favorite of the tea party, raised $4.1 million primarily from small donors but has been working to attract deeper-pocketed donors who could support a 2016 presidential run. Friess, a significant donor to Cruz's 2012 campaign, attended the State of the Union as Cruz's guest.\n\nThe early fundraising efforts are a sign of the competitive nature of the 2016 presidential race, with candidates and their allies building the foundations for potential campaigns and reaching out to wealthy donors who can provide the necessary funds to launch and sustain a presidential bid.",
    " Title: Democratic Debate Highlights: No Distinguishable Differences on Immigration Between Clinton and Sanders, Pandering to Latino Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic debate held on Wednesday at Miami Dade College primarily focused on immigration, border security, and legalization, with the first hour being almost entirely dedicated to these topics. The debate, hosted by Univision and moderated by Latino journalists, saw a significant emphasis on immigration-related issues, a reflection of the Latino voter demographic.\n\nBuck Sexton, a political commentator for CNN and host of \"The Buck Sexton Show\" on TheBlaze, noted that there was little discernible difference between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on immigration. Both candidates expressed empathy for the struggles of undocumented immigrants and advocated for a pathway to citizenship, even if it meant bypassing Congress and utilizing executive orders.\n\nThroughout the debate, the candidates avoided using the term \"amnesty,\" but their proposed policies would, in essence, result in amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Both candidates deviated from the standard Democratic National Committee talking points during discussions on deportations, promising leniency for non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nClinton suggested that deportations would cease for all non-criminal undocumented immigrants if she were to become president. Sanders appeared to concur with this stance. The implications of such a promise are significant: if only serious criminals are to be deported, would all other undocumented immigrants be allowed to remain in the U.S.? What about newly arrived undocumented immigrants or those with families already in the country? Furthermore, what precedent would it set for the country if the commander-in-chief were to disregard a substantial body of existing federal law?\n\nIn their attempts to outdo each other as champions of undocumented immigrants, both Clinton and Sanders seemed to entertain the idea that securing the border and enforcing laws against a significant number of illegal entrants could be achieved without doing so. They were, in effect, advocating for open borders, according to Sexton's analysis.",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Order on Anti-Semitism and its Implications for Campus Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's recent executive order on anti-Semitism has sparked controversy, with the left expressing skepticism about the motives behind the move. Critics cite Trump's previous comments about Jews and worry that the executive order could be used to stifle criticism of Israel on college campuses.\n\nThe executive order directs federal agencies to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism, which includes speech that criticizes the existence of the State of Israel as a racist endeavor. This has raised concerns, as the IHRA's definition includes examples of speech that should be protected under the First Amendment.\n\nThe executive order has been met with mixed reactions. While some argue that it could potentially be used to suppress free speech on college campuses, others contend that it only directs agencies to consider the IHRA's list as evidence of discriminatory intent in cases of overt anti-Semitism with an ethnic component.\n\nThe Trump Administration has already launched several investigations into pro-Palestinian campus speech under Title VI, and it is possible that this could escalate after the executive order. If found to have enabled anti-Semitism on campus, these universities could forfeit millions of dollars in federal funding. However, it is unclear whether the executive order will have a significant impact, as it mostly reaffirms the current law and does not necessarily impose new restrictions on speech.\n\nThe strategic implications of the strike on Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have also been a topic of debate. While Soleimani was a powerful figure, he was not a terror kingpin, and his death does not necessarily decapitate anything. The main question is whether the U.S. is entering a new war with Iran, and if so, what the war aims and objectives would be.\n\nIt is crucial that influential Republican senators remind President Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent the U.S. from stumbling further into war with Iran. The consequences of such a conflict are uncertain, and it is essential to consider the potential ramifications before taking action.",
    " Title: The Media's Preferred Candidates Fall Short in 2020 Democratic Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic presidential nomination process narrows down to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, it is worth revisiting the media's preferred candidates and their performance in the 2020 race.\n\nThe New York Times' dual endorsements for Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) failed to make a significant impact, much like the points in a game of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\". Similarly, the media's enthusiasm for South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, early interest in Beto O'Rourke, and adoration for Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) did not resonate with the majority of Americans outside the Acela corridor.\n\nInstead, Democratic voters consistently expressed their preference for the popular former vice president and the iconoclastic runner-up from the 2016 Democratic race. Before the primaries, Biden consistently led in polls, and Sanders performed well. The eventual voting followed this pattern, with early wins for Sanders and a comeback surge from Biden.\n\nThe idea that any other candidate had a particularly likely shot at the nomination was often a pundit-driven misdirection from a class of commentators who were more interested in presenting more interesting, intersectional characters, reflecting their own preferences for identity-based diversity.\n\nIndeed, the media's support for Warren was so strong that Vox's Matt Yglesias felt compelled to write a post explaining why she was losing, despite her popularity among the site's readers. Yglesias described Vox's audience as \"a graduate of or student at a selective college (which also describes the staff and our social peers)\" and lamented that \"if I were assigned the job of serving a less-educated audience, I'd probably need to think about how to change things up.\" He was right; outside the Vox bubble, there was little interest in the kind of cultural progressivism represented by Warren.\n\nAt present, Biden and Sanders are in a tight race for delegates. Both candidates have a good chance at the nomination. However, this was true a year ago as well. They were both better-known and better-liked than many in the media seemed to understand, and an endless series of magazine covers, fluff pieces, and editorial board endorsements aimed at other candidates could not make any difference whatsoever.",
    " Title: White House Denies Allegations of Russian Connection in Trump Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus stated that high-ranking U.S. intelligence officials have assured the administration that no members of President Trump's campaign had contact with Russian spies. The assertion comes in response to reports that began with an anonymously sourced story in The New York Times that has dominated news coverage for days.\n\nPriebus, in his comments, emphasized that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured him that the story is not only inaccurate but also grossly overstated. He described the allegations of a Russian connection as \"complete garbage\" and expressed concern over the ongoing speculation, stating that it distracts from important issues.\n\nThe allegations of a Russian connection began shortly after Trump's upset victory in November. Democrats have used the story to question the legitimacy of the election results. Since then, the story has become the focus of major news organizations and has prompted calls on Capitol Hill for investigations into Russian email hacking during the campaign to include links to Trump.\n\nThe news reports, some based on anonymous sources within the intelligence community, have alarmed the White House and top Republican lawmakers who believe leaks are emanating from Obama loyalists within the government. At a press conference last week, Trump ruled out any ties to Russia, stating, \"I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia.\"\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, bolstered the president's argument by saying Obama administration holdovers appeared to be illegally leaking information designed to damage Trump. Nunes stated, \"We do have people in the last administration, people who have burrowed in, perhaps all throughout the government, who clearly are leaking to the press\u2014and it is against the law.\"\n\nThe Washington Post story revealed that Michael Flynn, whom Trump had chosen as national security adviser, misled White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition. As a result, Flynn was forced to resign. The White House insists that Flynn's downfall was failing to tell Vice President Mike Pence that the discussion included recent U.S. sanctions against Russia\u2014not because of illegal or improper conduct for a national security adviser.\n\nNunes also said the problem started with Obama-era holdovers, not a rift between Trump and the intelligence community, as some news organizations reported. He stated, \"Let's get straight what we're talking about with the intelligence agencies because I think there's a lot of innuendo out there that the intelligence agencies have a problem with Donald Trump. The rank-and-file people that are out doing jobs across the world in very difficult places, they don't pay attention to what's going on in Washington.\"\n\nPriebus expressed concern over the impact of the \"fake news\" on the administration's agenda. He stated, \"All day long on every chyron, every seven minutes talking about Russian spies, talking about the intelligence community, talking about how me and [White House chief strategist] Steve Bannon don't like each other and what's [White House adviser Kellyanne Conway] doing\u2014all of this total garbage, unsourced stuff.\"\n\nPriebus further stated, \"All I'm saying is if you're going to come out with a story that says Russian spies are talking to your campaign\u2014oh my God\u2014I think you should in most cases actually have a named source. Look at what we have done: We've repealed [the Trans-Pacific Partnership], we have signed a coal bill to save the coal industry, we named Neil Gorsuch [for the Supreme Court], we deregulated the federal government. There's so many things to talk about.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Face Concerns as Election Approaches: Balancing Progressive Policies and Swing State Appeal\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, the Democratic party is grappling with the need to balance progressive policy proposals with the necessity of appealing to voters in key battleground states. The latest polls indicate that the Democratic candidate, whomever they may be, needs a compelling strategy to win over at least some of the states that President Trump carried in the last election.\n\nThe Times poll shows Bernie Sanders leading Trump by two points in Michigan, demonstrating that an anti-establishment, populist stance that emphasizes bread-and-butter issues can garner broad popular support. Sanders supports progressive policy proposals such as raising taxes on the rich, tackling political corruption, providing universal day care, and guaranteeing health care to everyone.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections saw Democrats win by running a populist campaign, focusing on reducing health care costs and helping ordinary families. The candidates avoided supporting unpopular progressive policy dreams, such as mandatory Medicare and border decriminalization. The 2020 presidential candidates are facing criticism for ignoring the lessons of 2018, as they can still support ambitious progressive ideas without running afoul of popular opinion.\n\nHowever, to win over voters in key swing states, candidates must also signal that they care about winning the votes of people who do not consider themselves very liberal. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is facing criticism for her progressive stance and her perceived disdain for incremental change, which could turn off voters she would need in key swing states.\n\nSome argue that Warren's appeal to Iowa voters and high-information Democrats nationally as not too shrewish or extreme to be president is not enough to win over a larger audience. Drawing a four-hour selfie line in New York does not equate to winning Michigan, as Warren is running by spurning even moderate Democrats, promising to 'fight' rather than compromise, and insisting on the most radical health-care plan ever proposed by a major-party nominee.\n\nJoe Biden, on the other hand, has a head start with the half of the Democratic electorate that has moderate or conservative views. However, it is much harder for a newer moderate Democrat lacking an established identity to build a national constituency. The only avenue that has seemed to be open for a candidate to break into the top has been to excite activists, who are demanding positions far to the left of the median voter.\n\nThe Democratic party should be wary of nominating a candidate with less appeal than Hillary Clinton in key swing states, as it could lead to a loss in the election. The candidates are still close enough to Trump that they can compete, and new events, like a recession or another scandal, could erode Trump's base. However, the party should look at its position a year before the election with real fear.\n\nIn the midst of this political landscape, the impeachment inquiry against President Trump is gaining momentum. While Trump's defenders argue that the evidence is circumstantial, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment, but whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.",
    " Title: Analysis of Trump's Alleged Abuse of Power and Campaign Finance Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the impeachment of a president is a significant event, serving as a check on executive power. The current administration, under President Donald Trump, has been the subject of two impeachment articles, one of which pertains to alleged abuse of power. This article, in particular, highlights Trump's efforts to leverage the federal government for personal and political gain, a practice reminiscent of Richard Nixon's actions during his presidency.\n\nThe article underscores Trump's repeated calls for investigations against his political opponents, including his attempt to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton. This behavior, it is argued, has violated the constitutional rights of American citizens and undermined the credibility of the judicial system.\n\nAnother point of contention is Trump's ownership of his hotels, which allows politicians, lobbyists, and foreigners to enrich him and curry favor with him. This practice, the article suggests, is a form of corruption that the Democratic-controlled House has failed to address effectively.\n\nThe article also touches upon the issue of campaign finance violations, specifically the undisclosed hush-money payments made during the final weeks of the 2016 election. The article argues that these payments, totaling $280,000, could have potentially tipped the election in Trump's favor, given the narrow margin of victory.\n\nLastly, the article discusses Trump's use of pardons, suggesting that his encouragement for people to break the law or impede investigations in exchange for future pardons is a departure from traditional presidential practices.\n\nThe article serves as a comprehensive analysis of the allegations against Trump, providing a neutral perspective on the various issues at hand. It is a call for increased oversight and accountability, particularly from the Democratic-controlled House, in the face of what is perceived as corruption and potential violations of constitutional rights.",
    " Title: Jindal Urges Republicans to Reconsider Strategy, Embrace Free-Market Policies and Diversity\n\nIn a fiery speech at the Republican National Committee's Winter Meeting, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal called on his party to rethink their approach to politics, urging them to move away from a focus on government bookkeeping and austerity, and instead boldly showcase the benefits of free-market policies.\n\nJindal, who was elected last year to lead the Republican Governor's Association, criticized the Republican Party for not only losing elections but also losing issue arguments with Democrats. He argued that the current debate between the two parties is \"terrible\" and \"fought entirely on our opponents' terms.\"\n\nThe Louisianan urged Republicans to compete for every single vote, regardless of political affiliation, and to reject the notion that demography is destiny. He emphasized the importance of treating all people as individuals rather than as members of special interest groups.\n\nJindal's remarks come as the Republican National Committee has directed a five-member panel, known as the \"Growth and Opportunity Project,\" to identify winning political strategies for the future, particularly in the area of minority outreach.\n\nIn his speech, Jindal also criticized the economic stimulus programs of President Barack Obama's administration, citing the failed green energy company Solyndra as an example. He also took aim at the Democrats, stating, \"Which of you wants to sign up to help manage the slow decline of the United States of America? I sure don't. That's what we have Democrats for.\"\n\nJindal's remarks were laced with criticism of and laugh lines at the expense of Democrats, but he was also distinctly blunt with his appraisal of the GOP. He called for a shift in the ambition of the conservative movement away from managing government and toward the mission of growth.\n\nJindal also joked about the Romney campaign's voter turnout technology, ORCA, which was reportedly plagued with glitches on Election Day. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will be up for re-election as RNC chairman on Friday.",
    " Title: Chicago Loses Second Amendment Case Over Gun Range Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent ruling by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the city of Chicago has lost another Second Amendment case, this time over its attempt to make it virtually impossible for private gun ranges to operate within the city. The latest lawsuit stems from Chicago's recalcitrance in complying with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago.\n\nThe McDonald decision overturned the city's virtual ban on firearms. In response, Chicago enacted a series of city ordinances that were so restrictive that they were intended to make it difficult to purchase, own, or carry a gun. The city's latest loss came in Ezell v. City of Chicago, a case that has come before the court twice.\n\nThe city's latest loss was due to three zoning provisions that: (1) allowed gun ranges only as special uses in manufacturing districts, (2) prohibited gun ranges within 100 feet of another range or within 500 feet of a residential district, school, place of worship, or multiple other places, and (3) barred anyone under the age of 18 from entering a shooting range.\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Judge Diane Sykes, one of the judges listed as a possible Supreme Court pick by Donald Trump. The majority concluded that the zoning provisions on manufacturing districts and the distance rule are so restrictive that they \"severely limit [ ] Chicagoans' Second Amendment right to maintain proficiency in firearm use via target practice at a range.\"\n\nIn trying to defend these restrictions, the city \"raised only speculative claims of harm to public health and safety,\" Sykes wrote. The city also had to admit that many of the existing gun ranges operated by law enforcement and private security firms do so safely near schools, churches, parks, and stores.\n\nThe court affirmed that the city of Chicago has a right to \"regulate the construction and operation of firing ranges to address genuine risks to public health and safety.\" However, the city failed to justify any of the \"risks\" it claimed to be addressing with the gun-range ordinance.\n\nThis latest loss is a significant setback for Chicago, which has a history of defying the U.S. Supreme Court's Second Amendment rulings. It remains to be seen whether this latest loss will cause the city to reconsider its stance on gun rights or if it will continue to resist complying with the Supreme Court's decisions.",
    " Title: Macron's White House Visit: A Test of French-American Relations and the Future of Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the 40-year-old French president, embarks on a significant journey to the United States, aiming to navigate the complexities of the relationship between France and the US, and to assert his role in shaping the future of Europe. The visit, fraught with anticipation and apprehension, comes at a time when the US, under President Donald Trump, has shown contempt for the European project and the values it represents.\n\nMacron's first presidential trip to the US is steeped in the narrative of French exceptionalism, a concept that underscores France's unique importance in the world. The visit, accompanied by the pomp and ceremony of a state dinner in the White House, serves to flatter Gallic pride, reinforcing the image of a French president on the global stage, standing alongside the leader of the world's most powerful country.\n\nThe contrast between Macron and Trump, in terms of style and substance, adds intrigue to the encounter. As the US grapples with the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Macron, like Trump, emerged from an era of polarization. However, the power these two men wield is vastly different.\n\nThe visit has sparked a flurry of interest, with questions surrounding Macron's ability to influence Trump on matters such as Iran, trade, and climate change. Meanwhile, the fascination extends to Macron's European plans and his centrist credo, often dismissed as doomed or disingenuous.\n\nIn a series of op-eds in the US, Macron's latest speech on Europe has been lauded, with his warning about the dangers of nationalism resonating in liberal America. Macron's European ambitions are evident, as he seeks to claim leadership on the continent and address the growing threat of populism. If Macron's aim is to make France \"great again,\" he knows that this can only be achieved by making Europe strong, and France strong within it.\n\nMacron's European ambitions depend not only on his domestic reform agenda but also on his ability to raise his profile in Washington and draw credibility from that in Europe. Macron is well aware that his presidency was made possible by the 1958 Gaullist constitution, which allows the circumventing of established parties and the rise of an outsider. He also understands that the French yearn for a leader with authority, and that Europeans want protection.\n\nAs Macron navigates the complexities of the US-European relationship, he faces criticism from both the far left and the far right. However, this criticism serves his interest, helping him appear as a rational reformer in the face of radical attacks. Macron's visit to the US is a significant step in his quest to reboot Europe and assert France's role in shaping its future. The outcome of this visit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for both France and Europe.",
    " Title: Trump and Pruitt to Roll Back Obama-Era Clean Power Plan, Signal Shift in EPA Priorities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Donald Trump is set to visit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday, where he will sign an executive order aimed at rolling back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. The new order, a key initiative of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, will mark a significant step in Pruitt's efforts to restore the EPA to its original, more limited authorities.\n\nDuring an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, Pruitt expressed his enthusiasm for the president's visit, which he believes will set a new course for the EPA. \"We're going to roll back those things that were unlawful, we're going to roll back those things that were an overreach, we're going to roll back the steps taken by the previous administration,\" Pruitt said.\n\nThe executive order will not only initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan but also change Obama-era executive orders on climate change and carbon emissions regulations. This shift represents a dramatic departure from Obama's legacy, which prioritized a regulatory agenda focused on climate change.\n\nPruitt's philosophy, which he terms \"EPA originalism,\" is in line with the Trump administration's goal to dismantle federal government overreach in the name of economic growth. Pruitt believes that the regulatory process has become so complex that it hinders economic growth.\n\n\"We have situations here, and this is not just unique to the EPA, it's other agencies at the federal level as well that do permitting, where it takes eight or nine years to get a permit to do something,\" Pruitt said. \"Well, that's not a decision, that's obstructionism.\"\n\nThe EPA, under Pruitt, aims to restore confidence among businesses and workers in the energy industry, particularly in coal, natural gas, and oil. \"Agencies at the federal level are part of the executive branch, they exist to enforce the law, not make the law,\" Pruitt said.\n\nPruitt's tenure at the EPA will also see the signing of a series of rules and procedures to reform the agency. The rescinding of the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt explained, is a \"snapshot of the future\" of how the Trump administration will approach regulatory reform.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Pruitt argued, the oil, coal, and natural gas industries were under federal \"regulatory assault,\" which led to the loss of energy jobs across the country. \"I think the greatest impediment we've had on economic growth is regulatory uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nPruitt's goal is to refocus the EPA on its original mission, which includes tackling big environmental cleanup projects and addressing the 1,300 hazardous \"superfund sites\" designated by the agency as priority areas for cleanup. \"Many of those sites\u2026 on this national priority list have been on that list for 30-40 years, that doesn't sound like a priority list to me,\" Pruitt said.\n\nThe executive order will not repeal the EPA's Endangerment Finding on CO2 emissions, but Pruitt has left the door open for future consideration of this issue. \"I think that if there are petitions for reconsideration for the endangering findings, we'll have to address those at some point,\" Pruitt said. \"Our objective, and our role is to do what the law requires.\"",
    " Title: Putin Expresses Concern Over U.S.-Russia Relations, Vows to Step Down in 2024\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has expressed concern over the ongoing investigations in the United States that he believes are hindering improved relations with Moscow. In a speech at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin stated, \"We are hostages to this internal strife in the United States.\" He added, \"I hope that it will end some day and the objective need for the development of Russian-American relationships will prevail.\"\n\nDuring the forum, attended by world leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Putin also announced his intention to step down from his post in 2024, adhering to the Russian constitution's ban on anyone serving two consecutive presidential terms. However, Putin's pledge does not necessarily mean he will retire, as he previously stepped down after two terms to become prime minister before returning to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, questioning, \"What should it be punished for, then?\" He also lamented the state of relations with America, criticized U.S. sanctions against Russia, and slammed Trump's decision to pull out of the deal as creating an atmosphere of \"nervousness and lack of trust.\"\n\nPutin also criticized the imposition of Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. He described the situation as \"chaotic\" and likened it to a game of football played with judo rules, creating an \"interesting game, it's neither football, nor judo. It's just chaos.\"\n\nIn a light-hearted exchange with Macron, Putin offered to help protect Europe if its dispute with the U.S. widens. Macron responded on a serious note, stating that France and its allies could stand for themselves.\n\nPutin's comments come as the U.S.-Russia relationship remains strained, with ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the ongoing tensions over Ukraine and Syria. The Russian president's remarks underscore the need for continued dialogue and diplomacy to improve relations between the two nations.",

The country reported 3,009,611 cases at midday on Wednesday, with a record 60,000 new cases reported on Tuesday.\n\nCalifornia and Texas both reported more than 10,000 new cases in a single day, shattering previous records. Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina have led the world in new cases over the last seven days, according to data from the New York Times.\n\nHospitals in Florida have run out of beds in their intensive care units, even as Governor Ron DeSantis continues to downplay the situation and refuses to release critical information about hospitalizations.\n\nExperts previously predicted a summer lull in infections, but that never materialized. Many states, facing pressure from business leaders and the White House, rushed to reopen without fully anticipating the impact on new infections.\n\nWhite House coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx said in a Sirius XM interview on Tuesday that states ignored guidelines put in place by federal and local public health officials and \"stepped on the gas\" while reopening, causing this new surge.\n\nAfter calling on governors to reopen state economies, the Trump administration has now shifted its attention to pressure schools to fully reopen in the fall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance for safely reopening schools, but President Trump tweeted his displeasure with his own public health agency on Wednesday, saying the guidelines were too burdensome and \"expensive.\"\n\nTesting capacity is being strained in those states with the largest number of new infections, and supply chain issues that plagued the country early in the pandemic have resurfaced.\n\nWhile Trump and other administration officials have latched onto a declining fatality rate as a sign of progress, Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said focusing on that one statistic is a \"false narrative.\"\n\n\"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into a false complacency,\" Fauci said. \"Deaths are a lagging indicator in an outbreak, and will rise as people generally don't die until weeks after they become sick.\"\n\nIn addition, many of the newly infected have been young people, who generally tend to be healthier. \"But that doesn't mean that you could not get seriously ill,\" Fauci said.",

Ltd. in India.\n\nJioMart, currently available in three neighborhoods surrounding Mumbai, offers more than 50,000 grocery products, free home delivery, and a lenient return policy. The platform, labeled as 'the nation's new store,' is a glimpse of Reliance Industries' move towards consumer-oriented businesses.\n\nThe pilot site indicates Reliance Industries' entry into the e-commerce market, which KPMG predicts will grow to $200 billion by 2027. Ambani aims to contribute 50% of Reliance Industries' earnings from newer businesses like telecommunications and retail, up from the current 32%, as stated in August.\n\nAmbani's previous project, requiring nearly $50 billion of capital expenditure, has shown signs of success. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the group's wireless carrier started in 2016, is India's No.1 operator today and has over 350 million users. The company entered the world's second-largest market by subscribers with free calls and cheap data, forcing some incumbents to exit or merge with rivals.\n\nAmbani is seeking to replicate this success in online retail, terming it \"new commerce.\" In August, Ambani stated his goal is to \"completely transform\" India's unorganized retail market, which accounts for 90% of the nation's industry.\n\nReliance Industries has announced a plan to create a $24 billion digital-services holding firm and vowed to list the new businesses within five years. The stock market has responded positively to this plan, with Reliance Industries shares soaring 36% this year, compared to the 15% advance in the benchmark index. The surge in the stock price has added more than $15 billion to Ambani's wealth, taking his net worth to almost $60 billion, according to the Billionaires Index.",
    " Title: Significant Reduction in Uninsured Americans: A Look at the Affordable Care Act's Progress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of uninsured Americans has seen a substantial decrease this year, with estimates suggesting a reduction of about 25 percent, or eight to eleven million people. This significant drop in the uninsured population is largely attributed to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with at least as many people enrolling in Medicaid as in private insurance through the new online marketplaces.\n\nAccording to various private sector surveys and a government report, the number of Americans without health insurance has been reduced by approximately 25 percent this year. This reduction equates to eight to eleven million people. Of this total, it appears that more than half of the newly insured individuals have signed up for Medicaid, particularly in states that expanded eligibility for the program to low-income residents. The remaining individuals have enrolled in private health plans through the new state insurance marketplaces.\n\nIn addition to the recent changes, an estimated three to four million people, primarily young adults, became newly insured through provisions of the ACA that took effect before this year.\n\nDan Witters, the research director of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which has been surveying Americans about their health insurance status since 2008, stated, \"There's no question it's come down.\" Gallup has recorded a drop in the percentage of American adults without insurance from 18 percent in mid-2013 to 13.4 percent by the end of May. These results align with other polls.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund, a health research group in New York, has commissioned a quarterly telephone poll that found a five percentage point reduction in uninsured adults under 65. A government survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention covered only the first three months of the year, but its results are consistent with the other studies for that period.\n\nWhether the reduction is considered a success or a disappointment depends on one's perspective. When the health care law passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that by 2017, about 32 million more Americans would gain insurance through the law. Due to policy changes, such as the Supreme Court decision that made state Medicaid expansion optional, the budget office's current estimate is now lower, about 26 million people. The nation appears to be at least a third of the way to that target.\n\nIt is still early to determine with certainty who has gained coverage. However, a few trends are clear. Most notably, Medicaid expansion has had a substantial impact. States that expanded their programs have seen a significantly larger reduction in their uninsured population compared to states that did not expand.\n\nWhile asking whether people have insurance is a good initial question when evaluating the law, it should not be the final one. Critics express concerns about individuals cycling out of coverage quickly due to failed premium payments or about the affordability and accessibility of the health plans offered through the marketplaces.\n\nOver the next four years, the ACA is projected to expand coverage to millions more Americans. However, it is expected that about 30 million people will remain uninsured even after several years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some of this is by design, as people in the country illegally are excluded from coverage under the law. Additionally, about four million low-income Americans are caught in a policy gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Some of these individuals may be difficult to reach due to factors such as mental illness, language barriers, or isolation. Others may still find insurance coverage undesirable or unaffordable.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will not bring the country universal health insurance coverage, but it is starting to close the gap.",
    " Title: Tom Brokaw Apologizes for Assimilation Remarks, Sparks Debate on Language and Assimilation in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, veteran journalist Tom Brokaw sparked controversy with his comments on language and assimilation among Hispanics in the United States. The former NBC anchor, known for his longtime role as an anchor and for chronicling the \"greatest generation\" of Americans, suggested that Hispanics should work harder at assimilation and ensure that their children learn English.\n\nThe response to Brokaw's comments was swift and intense, with many critics labeling them as racist and xenophobic. Aura Bogado, an investigative immigration reporter at Reveal, described Brokaw's comments as a \"deeply racist rant.\" Julio Ricardo Varela, the founder of LatinoRebels.com, said the comments were \"a punch in the gut to a lot of people.\"\n\nLiberal commentator Maria Cardona called Brokaw \"a little out of touch,\" while insisting that \"Latinos absolutely assimilate.\" However, many critics pointed out that if Latinos were truly assimilating, they would be speaking English, but many of them are not.\n\nBrokaw's fellow panelist on Meet the Press, Yamiche Alcindor, took a different stance, stating that the idea that Americans can only speak English is troubling. \"The idea that Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages weren't always part of America, is in some ways troubling,\" Alcindor said.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Brokaw issued an apology on Twitter, stating that his comments were \"offensive to many\" and that he never intended to disparage any segment of society. Brokaw also apologized to Alcindor, despite the fact that their views were directly contradictory.\n\nThe debate over language and assimilation in America has been a contentious issue for many years, with some arguing that immigrants should assimilate and learn English to fully participate in American society, while others argue that immigrants should be allowed to maintain their cultural and linguistic identities.\n\nThe Census Bureau's American Community Survey shows that the fraction of U.S. households answering yes to the question of speaking a language other than English at home has risen steadily over the last three decades, reaching 22 percent in 2017. Many of those who speak another language at home claim they also speak English well or very well, but further studies have shown that is not always the case.\n\nThe issue of language and assimilation is complex and multifaceted, and it is likely to continue to be a topic of debate in the United States for years to come. As the country becomes more diverse, the question of how to balance cultural and linguistic diversity with the need for a common language and shared identity will continue to be a pressing issue.",
    " Title: Boehner Faces Challenges in Steering Tax Reform and Year-End Deal Amidst Revenue and Progressivity Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent elections, House Speaker John Boehner faces the daunting task of steering reluctant Republicans towards a year-end deal on tax reform, a challenge compounded by the ongoing debate over revenue targets and the standard of progressivity in the revised tax code.\n\nThe 1980s tax reform, often reminisced by Republicans, is a stark reminder of the complexities involved in setting revenue targets and maintaining a progressive tax structure. The capital gains rate, a key point of contention in the current debate, ended up at 28 percent, significantly higher than the rates paid by Mitt Romney and even President Barack Obama.\n\nBefore any substantial tax reform, two primary questions need to be addressed: the revenue target and the standard of progressivity that will govern the revised code. Lowering rates is a reasonable objective, but setting rates in advance could potentially put the cart before the horse.\n\nThe 1980s tax reformers did not initially aim to abolish the preferential treatment for capital gains; in fact, Ronald Reagan's aides considered a lower rate of 17.5 percent. However, the need to meet the revenue target and adhere to an agreed-upon distribution of the tax burden across income groups led to the eventual outcome.\n\nDavid Brockway, counsel to the Joint Tax Committee during the 1986 reform effort, emphasized this point in his September testimony. The same pressures will be even more pronounced in any reform effort today.\n\nAs the White House meeting this week offers a fresh start for Boehner to secure his nomination as the speaker, Obama will also need to demonstrate more flexibility on the spending side of the ledger if he expects Boehner to guide reluctant Republicans towards a year-end deal.\n\nThe president's East Room appearance on Friday underscores his confidence, but the real test of strength lies in his ability to compromise and bring Republicans towards him. The White House's reputation for patronizing Congress has worsened over the past four years, particularly during the \"do nothing\" dynamics of the election year.\n\nTwo potential avenues to change the tone could be reforms in the food stamp program and action on a long-discussed change in the inflation index used to adjust government benefits and tax brackets. Each option risks backlash from certain groups, but the need for long-range changes is widely acknowledged by thoughtful people in both parties.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has proposed a new CPI that minimizes the impact on the most elderly Social Security recipients while still saving about $150 billion over 10 years. In the case of food stamps, reforms could also facilitate the long-delayed farm bill, promising billions in additional savings by ending an outdated system of direct cash payments to producers.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee leadership has attempted to address food stamp reform, but has received little recognition for their efforts. A bipartisan plan was developed that would have set a new national standard for food stamps, replacing the current patchwork system that has developed as cash-strapped governors bend the rules to help low-income families, all at federal expense.",
    " Title: California Launches $75 Million Cash Assistance Program for Unauthorized Immigrants Excluded from Federal Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, known for its diversity and progressive policies, is set to roll out a $75 million cash assistance program on Monday to provide financial aid to unauthorized immigrants who have been excluded from traditional government aid programs due to their immigration status. The program, which is expected to benefit 150,000 individuals, will offer each household a maximum of $1,000.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom announced the program in a statement, emphasizing the state's commitment to supporting all its residents during the ongoing crisis. \"California is here to support them during this crisis,\" Newsom said. \"We are all in this together.\"\n\nThe program, funded by taxpayer dollars, will be conducted primarily over the phone to minimize in-person contacts. Eligible applicants must demonstrate that they are unauthorized, jobless due to the pandemic, and do not qualify for unemployment programs or stimulus checks.\n\nThe state has directed the funding to 12 nonprofit organizations, who will be responsible for evaluating applicants and distributing the aid. Over 2 million unauthorized immigrants reside in California, according to the California Public Policy Institute, and they constitute around 9% of its labor force. Many work in low-wage jobs in sectors heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as hotels and restaurants.\n\nWhile the federal government has excluded unauthorized immigrants from the initial round of $1,200 stimulus checks, the House of Representatives has approved a $3 trillion coronavirus spending package that, under one of its provisions, would allow unauthorized immigrants to qualify for a direct federal payment using their Taxpayer Identification Numbers. However, the bill faces opposition from Republicans, who have declared the bill dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\nThe program in California is not the first of its kind. In April, the state announced a $125 million fund to provide one-time payments of up to $500 to undocumented workers who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic. The state also provided $75 million in grants to small businesses owned by unauthorized immigrants.\n\nPhilanthropic organizations are also donating $50 million to the current program, allowing more immigrants to benefit from the financial relief. The state's efforts to support unauthorized immigrants during the pandemic have been praised by advocacy groups, but have also sparked criticism from some Republicans who argue that the state should prioritize aid for U.S. citizens.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to impact the economy, the financial situation of many unauthorized immigrants remains precarious. The cash assistance program in California aims to provide much-needed relief to this vulnerable population.",
    " Title: White House Urges Bipartisan Support for Gun Control Measures as Debate Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of Sunday morning interviews, the Obama administration called on Republicans to support the President's gun control plan, emphasizing the widespread public support for expanded background checks on gun purchases. Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House adviser, appeared on Fox News Sunday and ABC's This Week, highlighting that 90% of Americans back the President's proposal for stricter background checks.\n\nPfeiffer urged Republicans to abandon potential filibuster tactics, stating, \"You can't get 90% of Americans to agree on the weather.\" He warned that a Republican filibuster could hinder the passage of substantial and meaningful gun-reform legislation.\n\nPfeiffer's call for bipartisan cooperation may find an ally in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who suggested on CBS's Face the Nation that his party should not filibuster gun-control debates. McCain argued, \"Everyone wants the same goal, which is to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are mentally disabled.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR), now the director of the National Rifle Association's National School Shield Task Force, advocated for armed guards in schools to safeguard teachers and students. Hutchinson argued that even with universal background checks, criminals would still obtain guns, and the need for school security would not diminish.\n\nHowever, Pfeiffer criticized the NRA's suggestions, which are widely supported by Republicans, stating that more guns would exacerbate the situation. Pfeiffer emphasized the need for increased school safety measures, but also for the implementation of \"common-sense measures that are supported by the majority of Americans.\"",
    " Title: Scotland's Historic Decision: A Referendum on Independence and the Future of the United Kingdom\n\nArticle:\n\nScotland is set to decide today whether to end 300 years of union with Great Britain and become an independent nation, as they cast their ballots in a historic referendum that could have far-reaching implications. The question at hand is simple: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\n\nWith 4,285,323 people\u201497% of the electorate\u2014registered to vote, a historically high turnout is expected. Voting will take place at 2,608 polling stations across the country until 10:00 PM on Thursday, with the result expected early on Friday morning.\n\nAs NPR's Ari Shapiro reports from Edinburgh, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a final emotional appeal to keep the United Kingdom intact. Speaking in Aberdeen, Cameron warned that a vote for independence would precipitate a \"painful divorce.\" In the past, he has said that a decision by Scots to leave the union would leave him heartbroken.\n\n\"If you don't like me\u2014I won't be here forever. But if you leave the U.K., that will be forever,\" Cameron said bluntly.\n\nPresident Obama also weighed in on the referendum just 24 hours before the voting began, saying he'd like to see the United Kingdom remain \"strong, robust, and united.\" Former President Bill Clinton also urged a \"no\" vote.\n\nAlex Salmond, the leader of the campaign for independence, cast his ballot in his home village of Aberdeenshire. \"I got a fantastic night's sleep. Obviously, there's a great deal of anticipation, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it's a day that everybody will remember,\" he said.\n\n\"We're in the hands of the people of Scotland, and there's no safer place to be than in the hands of the Scottish people,\" Salmond added.\n\nThe outcome of the vote is also being closely watched in other independence-minded regions of the world, from Quebec to Catalonia and Kashmir. Leighton Andrews, the public services minister for Wales, told the BBC last week that he believed that \"radical\" constitutional change was in store for the U.K. as a direct result of the vote.\n\n\"I think it will have major implications for the U.K. regardless of the result of the referendum,\" he said.\n\nThe referendum is a significant moment in Scottish history, and the outcome will have a lasting impact on the United Kingdom and beyond.",
    " Title: Former Pentagon Official's Critique of Whistleblowing System Sparks Calls for Justice Department Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nAs a former head of the CIA, David Petraeus, in an interview published in the Financial Times on May 6, expressed his support for the prosecution of Edward Snowden, the infamous whistleblower who leaked classified information about the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs. Snowden, in response, has called for a whistleblower shield, following a new Pentagon insider account that undermines the idea that the inspector general's office offers a safe route for whistleblowers.\n\nJohn Crane, a former supervisor of the whistleblower-protection unit of the Pentagon inspector general, has provided a powerful account in Mark Hertsgaard's book, Bravehearts: Whistle-Blowing in the Age of Snowden. Crane's story, which details the case of Thomas Drake, an NSA employee who took his concerns about warrantless surveillance to the inspector-general's office, suggests that the office failed to protect Drake, potentially passing his identity to the justice department.\n\nThis account challenges the notion that the inspector general's office provides a safe route for whistleblowers. Crane and his advocates argue for wholesale reform of the whistleblowing system to ensure that there are real protections in place. At present, there is no clarity regarding the protections offered by existing legislation such as the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nContractors, like Snowden, are not covered by the same protections as full-time staff due to a legislative carve-out at the behest of the intelligence agencies that occurred the year before Snowden's disclosures. The stakes for an inquiry at the US justice department, set to launch on June 1, are nothing less than the future of national security whistleblowing. Will it follow Snowden's model or Drake's?\n\nSnowden, often dismissed as a traitor, a spy, or a Russian stooge, has also faced criticism for his actions. However, many in US national security circles acknowledge that episodes like Drake's indicate the institutional deck is stacked against an insider seeking to warn of the dangers to freedom represented by bulk surveillance carried out by the US intelligence apparatus and with the approval of the leadership of secret congressional committees overseeing it.\n\nCrane, who lost his career for defending Drake, is conflicted about Snowden. He hopes that the US justice department inquiry will ultimately \"deter the Edward Snowdens of the future, that it will convince them that they are able to work within the system.\" However, some, like Jesselyn Radack, a prominent whistleblower lawyer who represented Crane and Drake, are skeptical that the inquiry will yield the necessary reforms.\n\nTom Devine, another of Crane's attorneys, believes the inquiry is a step necessary to save a broken whistleblower system. Unlike many national security investigations, much of its work will become public, thanks to the partnership of the federal Office of Special Counsel, which itself works to safeguard whistleblower rights. Once the inquiry ends, probably next year, the office will alert Congress and the White House and post its work product online.\n\n\"It's a foundation for serious, long-term efforts for reform,\" said Devine. \"Instead of it being one person who accuses a major government institution of misconduct, it's the official good-government agency finding a substantial likelihood of misconduct.\"\n\nOne of the routes supposedly open to Snowden would have been to go to Congress. The problem with this is that the critical figures in Congress already knew about the scale of mass surveillance but did not do anything about it. It was left to Snowden to make his flight to Hong Kong.\n\nThe justice department inquiry, set to unfold in the coming months, will be a significant step in determining whether non-public whistleblowing will be a viable or robust option. The future of national security whistleblowing hangs in the balance.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation into Trump Campaign's Russian Ties: Focus on Manafort, Alfa Bank, and Hacking Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the FBI has been conducting an investigation into potential links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The investigation, which has been ongoing for six weeks, was initially prompted by apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump's aides and Moscow. However, it has been clarified that Mr. Trump himself has not become a target of the investigation, and no direct evidence linking him or his associates to Russia's election operations has emerged.\n\nOne focus of the investigation has been Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman for much of the year. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, particularly Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to the ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. The focus in Manafort's case, according to an official, has been on his ties with the kleptocratic government in Ukraine and whether he declared the income in the United States, rather than any Russian influence over Mr. Trump's campaign.\n\nIn August and September, intelligence officials briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They particularly highlighted what cyberexperts described as a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, one of Russia's biggest banks, whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin. The FBI spent weeks examining computer data showing an unusual stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. However, the FBI ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, such as a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\n\nThe most serious part of the FBI's investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. This investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators have reportedly become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia's direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America's standing in the world more broadly. The hacking is seen as a reflection of an intensification of spy-versus-spy operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Mr. Putin's Russia have soured.",
    " Title: Martin McGuinness: From IRA Commander to Statesman\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early hours of this morning, the news broke that Martin McGuinness, the former first minister of Northern Ireland and a prominent figure in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), had passed away. His death was not unexpected, as McGuinness had stepped down as first minister in January due to a scandal involving his coalition partner, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). However, health reasons were cited for his decision not to seek re-election.\n\nMcGuinness, a man who had once been a commander in the IRA, was a complex figure who transitioned from a life of violence to a career in politics. His IRA credentials, which were the source of much controversy, ultimately allowed him to become a respected statesman in the latter half of his life.\n\nFor many Irish people in their late 30s, McGuinness was one half of a political duo, alongside Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams. During the early years of the peace process in the 1990s, McGuinness was the more shadowy of the two, earning the nickname \"the sinister minister\" when he took on the role of minister for education in the devolved government.\n\nThe relationship between McGuinness and his political adversaries, such as the late unionist leader and firebrand Protestant preacher, Ian Paisley, was once fraught with tension. Paisley was known as \"Dr. No\" due to his refusal to speak to Irish republicans for three decades. However, things would change, and McGuinness would go on to become deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, working alongside Paisley and successive DUP leaders Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster. The relationship between McGuinness and Paisley was so amicable that they were often referred to as \"the Chuckle Brothers.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's ambition has always been to unify Ireland, and not to administer a devolved government. McGuinness was no exception to this. His tactics did change, with the ballot box replacing the gun, and symbolic measures taking on more and more significance. In 2011, McGuinness even took a run at the presidency of Ireland, putting in a respectable performance although not coming close to winning.\n\nWhile Gerry Adams' stock has fallen over the years, McGuinness's has risen. Adams has been dogged by accusations that he authorized the murder of Jean McConville, one of the most controversial killings in the Irish conflict. McGuinness, on the other hand, was widely viewed in a more sympathetic light, particularly as he was from, and active in, Derry during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972, when 26 unarmed civilians were shot, 14 of them fatally, by British soldiers.\n\nMcGuinness's IRA membership was hardly a secret, and a photographer who had been in a rival republican group once showed him a letter, dated from the 1970s, that described the young IRA commander in Derry as a likely future major player. McGuinness's journey from gunman to statesman was real, and his legacy proves that even in this era of post-modern \"plural narratives\" and so-called \"fake news,\" brute facts and truth still matter.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, Marking Historic Milestone\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political milestone, the Senate confirmed Loretta Lynch as the new Attorney General on Thursday, following a filibuster attempt earlier in the day. The final vote, scheduled for the afternoon, marked the first time a black woman would hold the top law enforcement post in the United States.\n\nLynch, a federal prosecutor in New York, overcame the filibuster with a 66-34 vote, with Republican opposition primarily directed at President Obama, whose policies on immigration, health care, and environmental issues Lynch will be tasked with defending.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who voted against Lynch, expressed concerns about her stance on President Obama's executive action on immigration, which he deemed a constitutional overreach.\n\nPresident Obama had nominated Lynch following the 2014 elections, hoping for swift confirmation. However, Democrats, who controlled the Senate during the lame-duck session, delayed action, believing she would easily clear when the GOP took control in January. Instead, she languished as both sides clashed over abortion-funding provisions in a bill against human trafficking. An agreement this week finally cleared that snag, setting up the final Lynch vote.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the delays, labeling them a black mark for Republicans, whom they accused of thwarting civil rights history. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, stated, \"At long last this embarrassment for the Senate is over and this triumph for the American people will occur.\"\n\nLynch, who grew up in a North Carolina still grappling with civil rights issues, graduated from Harvard College and got her law degree from Harvard Law School. She has twice served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York\u2014first under President Clinton and beginning again under President Obama.\n\nOpposition to Lynch primarily stemmed from her association with President Obama and his efforts to test the limits of executive power, drawing fierce pushback from Republicans on Capitol Hill who accused him of ignoring the Constitution.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, Lynch defended the Justice Department's legal reasoning underpinning President Obama's deportation amnesty programs and refused to second-guess the president on a series of other actions. Republicans also questioned her independence, citing her close alignment with Eric Holder, who has repeatedly clashed with the GOP.\n\nSally Quillian Yates, whom President Obama nominated to be deputy attorney general, also cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, minutes before the filibuster vote on Lynch. Yates, a white prosecutor from Georgia, had strong support from that state's two Republican senators, which helped her nomination. During her confirmation hearings, she generally defended the president's policies but emphasized the Justice Department's role as an independent constitutional authority whose clients are the American people, not the president or Congress.\n\nThe confirmation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General and Sally Quillian Yates as deputy attorney general marks a significant shift in the leadership of the Department of Justice, with both women bringing diverse perspectives and extensive legal experience to their roles.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Release Revised Obamacare Replacement Bill: A Closer Look at the Revised Plan and Its Potential Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Senate Republicans on Thursday released a revised version of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The bill, which is still facing opposition from both moderates and conservatives, aims to address concerns over Medicaid cuts, private insurance subsidies, and the opioid addiction epidemic.\n\nThe revised bill retains the taxes imposed by the ACA on investment income and high earners, but eliminates the ACA's limit on corporate tax deductions for insurance companies. The bill still repeals other ACA taxes, including those on tanning beds, certain sectors of the health care industry, and high-cost employer-provided insurance plans.\n\nThe bill's impact on subsidies for premiums remains a concern. While the income limit for subsidies will be slightly lowered and made less generous, those with Health Savings Accounts can now use their contributions to pay for premiums. The bill also allows for the purchase of catastrophic plans, which have low premiums but high deductibles and limited benefits.\n\nFor those requiring extensive health care services, the bill provides funding for insurers to help cover the cost of sick customers, but it's unclear whether this funding will be sufficient to keep the plans affordable. The bill also allows insurers to sell plans that don't meet the ACA's requirements, potentially segmenting the market into sick and healthy individuals.\n\nThe bill maintains the ACA's rule that dependent children can stay on a parent's plan until age 26. However, enhanced federal funding for low-income adults who became newly qualified under the ACA will be phased out, ending after 2024. Federal support for traditional Medicaid will also be scaled back.\n\nThe revised bill includes changes to hospital payments to help cover the bills of the uninsured, and additional funding for states to reduce insurance costs in other ways. The bill also increases funding for addiction services, including $45 billion for the opioid epidemic, a significant increase from the initial $2 billion proposed.\n\nThe bill still removes the ACA's requirement that most people buy insurance, imposing a six-month waiting period for those with a gap in their insurance coverage. The bill also ends the ACA's penalties for larger employers who do not offer insurance to workers.\n\nFor those struggling with addiction, the revised bill provides increased funding for addiction services. However, it continues to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding for a year, and from providing contraception, testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and other services.\n\nThe bill's future remains uncertain, as there are still wavering Republican senators who have not committed to vote for it. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week.",
    " Title: Amash's Call for Impeachment of President Trump Sparks Debate Among Politicians\n\nArticle:\n\nJustin Amash, a five-term Michigan congressman, has stated that President Donald Trump's actions amount to \"impeachable conduct,\" a viewpoint that has sparked debate among politicians. The term \"impeachable conduct\" is a subject of contention, with some arguing that it is defined by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe House impeached former President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about a sexual encounter, but the conduct described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report is more serious and far-reaching, even if it does not constitute a provable criminal offense.\n\nWhen Amash became the first Republican legislator to make this point, the response from his colleagues revealed a determination to evade their responsibilities. Mitt Romney, the Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee, praised Amash's \"courageous statement\" but disagreed with his conclusion, arguing that there are insufficient elements to make a case for obstruction of justice.\n\nHowever, the Mueller report presents a strong case that at least some of Trump's attempts to interfere with the investigation of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election meet the three elements of obstruction: an obstructive act, a nexus to an official proceeding, and a corrupt intent. Trump's efforts to stop the FBI investigation of his former national security adviser, repeatedly demand Mueller's removal, press White House Counsel Donald McGahn to deny that Trump had tried to fire Mueller, urge his attorney general to take control of the Russia investigation and limit its scope, and discourage witnesses from cooperating with it, suggest that he met these criteria.\n\nMueller unambiguously rejected the view, advocated by Trump's lawyers and Attorney General William Barr, that the president cannot obstruct justice by exercising his otherwise lawful constitutional powers. However, this argument does not cover Trump's public and private attempts to influence the testimony of witnesses such as McGahn, his former lawyer Michael Cohen, and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nThe fact that Trump's attempts to impede federal investigations were mostly unsuccessful, due to resistance by his underlings, does not exonerate him, as attempted obstruction is also a crime. Furthermore, the fact that Mueller ultimately found no evidence that anyone in the Trump campaign illegally conspired with Russian agents is irrelevant, as Trump may have been motivated by a desire to prevent politically damaging revelations.\n\nAmash also emphasized that \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that justify impeachment extend beyond provable statutory violations to abuses of power that betray the public trust. Trump's own lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, admitted last year that it would be \"unthinkable\" for Trump to pardon himself, which \"would lead to probably an immediate impeachment,\" even though the Constitution imposes no limits on the pardon power.\n\nCongress might reasonably conclude that a president who uses his powers to protect himself in a less dramatic way\u2014by repeatedly interfering with an investigation of his own actions\u2014is unfit for office. The norm of avoiding even the appearance of such interference is worth preserving, whether or not it is legally required.\n\nRomney argues that impeachment would be impractical and politically unwise, given the current political climate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is discouraging her fellow Democrats from pursuing impeachment, seems to have reached a similar conclusion.\n\nWhile the political calculation may be understandable, members of both parties may come to regret the signal they are sending about the sort of presidential behavior Congress is willing to tolerate.",
    " Title: Senate Overcomes Filibuster, Advances Kavanaugh Nomination Amidst Partisan Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested 51-49 vote on Friday, the Senate managed to overcome a Democrat-led filibuster, keeping Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on track for confirmation. The vote, marked by deep divisions and historic partisan rancor, saw one defection from each party, cancelling each other out and providing enough leeway for the judge to clear the procedural hurdle. A final confirmation vote is now scheduled for Saturday, with some uncertainty remaining.\n\nThe vote was a significant milestone for Republicans, who viewed Friday's vote as an opportunity to send a message to the public amidst a time of deep political polarization. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated, \"We know the Senate is better than this. We know the nation deserves better than this.\"\n\nFour senators were undecided leading up to the vote: GOP Sens. Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Murkowski joined Democrats in the filibuster, but the other three voted to end debate and advance to a final vote. Collins, however, has signaled that her vote Friday morning was only to overcome the filibuster, and she will announce her final stance on confirming Judge Kavanaugh later in the day.\n\nDemocratic leaders criticized the confirmation process, accusing the GOP of rushing the judge through too quickly, questioning his conservatism, and suggesting that President Trump picked Kavanaugh to shield himself from legal troubles related to the special counsel's Russia probe. They also emphasized the recent sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, which date back to high school and college parties.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat at the center of the confirmation battle, stated, \"Based on all the factors we have before us, I do not believe Judge Kavanaugh has earned this seat.\" However, Democrats acknowledged that they would likely have faced similar opposition to any pick made by President Trump.\n\nRepublicans had initially hoped to have Kavanaugh on the high court in time for the justices' new session, which began earlier this week. However, last-minute sexual assault allegations disrupted this schedule, necessitating a new round of hearings and an updated FBI investigation.\n\nThe hearing and the FBI probe did not seem to settle the deep divide among Americans regarding whether they believe Kavanaugh or his chief accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Blasey Ford alleges that Kavanaugh assaulted her at a high school party in 1982. The people she identified as potentially corroborating witnesses have refuted her story, and Kavanaugh has vehemently denied her claim.\n\nDespite the allegations, support for Blasey Ford remains strong, particularly among anti-Trump activists who view Kavanaugh's confirmation as an opportunity to deal a significant blow to the president. They also fear that Kavanaugh's conservative views could shift the court's balance and lead to right-wing activism.\n\nThese fears fueled intense protests both inside and outside the Senate this week, with hundreds arrested inside congressional office buildings on Thursday. For Democratic senators, there was little they liked about the judge or the process.\n\nDespite a record number of documents being produced for review, millions of pages were not, and Democrats suspected that significant, potentially damning information remained hidden. They also criticized Kavanaugh's behavior during the hearings, citing his angry denunciation of the allegations against him as non-judicial.\n\nFriday's vote to overcome the filibuster sets up a final vote on Saturday, though there are still potential complications. One Republican senator plans to attend his daughter's wedding on Saturday, which could impact the timing of the vote. Additionally, Sen. Jeff Merkley is pursuing a long-shot lawsuit to ask a judge to intervene and order the release of more documents from Kavanaugh's past, which the Oregon Democrat hopes will cause a new delay in confirmation.",
    " Title: U.S. Loses Leverage in Syria Chemical Weapons Negotiations, According to Rep. Mike Rogers\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, argued that the United States has lost its leverage in the negotiations over chemical weapons in Syria, giving Russia a significant advantage.\n\nRogers stated that if Congress had moved more quickly and given the president authorization to strike Syria, the situation would look more favorable for the U.S. He explained, \"I think [the president's] hand would have been strengthened significantly if Congress would have given him the authority for a surgical strike to degrade [Syria's] chemical weapons use and he look like a commander in chief.\"\n\nRogers criticized the president for failing to adequately explain why an attack against Syria would be in the United States' security interests. He said, \"All of that confusion allowed Putin to step in and fill the void. I think that's a problem.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. and Russia reached a deal on a framework that would allow Syria to hand over control of its chemical weapons. However, the deal does not include a threat of military force should Syria fail to follow through with giving up its stockpiles.\n\nRogers expressed concern that \"not one ounce of chemical weapons came off the battlefield, but we've given up every ounce of our leverage when it comes to trying to solve the broader Syrian problem, because we've taken away a credible military threat.\"\n\nRogers also warned that the \"indecisiveness\" of the Obama administration in the past few weeks \"gave the diplomatic advantage\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, \"They saw it. They stepped in. This is a Russian plan for Russian interests. And we should be very, very concerned.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California was less pessimistic about the diplomatic deal, calling it a \"very positive step.\" Schiff acknowledged that it's been an \"ugly\" process and it will be \"tough\" to ensure Syria follows through, but he said it's \"the best pathway we've seen in the last couple years.\"\n\nOn Putin, Schiff downplayed the Russian president's strategic abilities, saying he's less like a master chess player and more like \"a lawyer who lost control of his client.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in an interview that aired Sunday, said he's not concerned with criticism of his handling of the Syria situation, stating that Washington tends to make judgments based on style rather than substance. He said, \"We know that, because that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War - until it ended up... blowing up in our face.\"\n\n\"I'm less concerned about style points,\" Obama added. \"I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right.\"",
    " Title: The Economic Legacy of President Obama and the 2016 Election: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, it is crucial to understand the role of economic policies in shaping the outcome and the legacy of the Obama administration. While many Americans are still grappling with job losses and economic hardships, the recovery of the U.S. economy under President Obama's tenure is a significant achievement that cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe Obama administration's policies, including the stimulus package, tax code reform, consumer and environmental protections, and healthcare reform, have contributed to a strong job market and wage growth. The U.S. economy recovered more swiftly and robustly from the Great Recession than most other wealthy nations, a testament to the effectiveness of these policies.\n\nAs President Obama hands over the reins to President-elect Donald Trump, it is essential to acknowledge that the economy he inherits is vastly different from the one he inherited from George W. Bush. It is equally important to recognize that the improvements in job creation and wage growth are the result of Obama's policies, not those of the Republican Party or Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, lost the election despite the economic improvements under Obama's administration. Her loss, by a margin of over 1 million votes, is not a reflection of the economy's performance but rather the idiosyncrasies of the electoral system and the FBI's investigation into her emails.\n\nExit polls show that Clinton won a majority of voters who considered the economy the most important issue facing the country. However, the number of voters who prioritized the economy was lower in 2016 compared to 2012, which may have hurt the Democrats.\n\nThe Clinton campaign's decision to focus more on Trump's bigotry rather than the economy and her plans to help the economically vulnerable may have been morally correct, but it may not have been the most politically astute move. Research suggests that reminding white voters of their racial identity tends to increase Republican votes.\n\nMoving forward, the Democratic Party must refocus on the economy and the positive impact of their policies. They need to emphasize how Republican policies lead to economic instability and wealth inequality, while Democratic policies help create an economy that benefits the majority. If Trump is able to take credit for Obama's economic achievements, he may secure a second term.\n\nIan Reifowitz, author of \"Obama's America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity,\" underscores the importance of this focus on the economy. The Democratic Party must articulate their vision of a strong, inclusive economy that works for the 99 percent.",
    " Title: Debate Over U.S. Troop Presence in Iraq: Obama and Romney Clash on Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest round of the 2012 presidential debate, the issue of the U.S. troop presence in Iraq resurfaced as a contentious topic. President Barack Obama, who opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, engaged in a heated exchange over the matter.\n\nDuring Monday night's debate, Obama, a Democrat who had opposed the Iraq war while still a state legislator in Illinois, stated, \"You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago, you said you thought we should have more troops in Iraq right now.\"\n\nRomney, who supported the invasion, countered by stating that Obama wanted to keep U.S. troops there longer but could not get the Iraqis to agree. \"There was an effort on the part of the president to have a Status of Forces Agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on,\" Romney said.\n\nThe Status of Forces Agreement signed between the United States and Iraq in 2008 called for U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraqi cities by 2009 and be out of the country entirely by the end of 2011. The Obama administration, which took office after the agreement was signed, tried to negotiate with Iraq to keep between 3,000 and 5,000 American troops in the country to help train Iraqi security forces.\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta stated in October 2011, \"If they want the benefits of what we can provide, if they want the assistance, if they want the training, if they want the operational skills that we can provide, then I think they have to understand that they've got to give us some protections in that process.\"\n\nHowever, those talks failed when the Iraqis refused to grant legal immunity for U.S. troops, and the last U.S. convoy left Iraq in December 2011. Obama touted that as a promise kept, saying Americans would be leaving \"with their heads held high.\"\n\nRomney has consistently criticized the Obama administration for its failure to reach a deal with the Iraqi government on keeping those troops there. In December 2011, with the final pullout looming, Romney told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration was ending the American presence \"in a precipitous way, and we should have left 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqis' own military capabilities.\"\n\nTwo weeks before Monday night's debate, in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the \"costly gains\" made in Iraq were slipping away. \"And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence,\" he said. \"The president tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.\"\n\nBoth men's attacks are rooted in fact. The Obama administration did attempt, unsuccessfully, to extend the presence of a scaled-back U.S. training mission in Iraq, while Romney has said Washington should have kept a considerably larger force in Baghdad. The issue of the U.S. troop presence in Iraq remains a contentious topic in American politics, with both candidates presenting their perspectives on the matter.",
    " Title: Sioux Tribes in South Dakota Refuse to Dismantle Coronavirus Checkpoints on Reservation Borders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a standoff with the state government, the Sioux tribes in South Dakota have refused to remove coronavirus checkpoints they have established on roads passing through their reservations. The checkpoints are a crucial measure, according to the tribes, to prevent the virus from entering their territories, given the limited healthcare facilities on the reservations.\n\nGovernor Kristi Noem of South Dakota wrote to several tribal leaders last week, stating that the checkpoints were illegal. However, the Sioux tribes argue that these checkpoints are their only means of safeguarding their communities from the virus.\n\nCurrently, only essential travel is allowed into the reservations for those who have not recently traveled from a Covid-19 hotspot. Travelers must also complete a health questionnaire before entering.\n\nGovernor Noem has threatened to take the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to federal court if they do not comply with her demands to remove the checkpoints. In a letter sent to their representatives on Friday, she demanded the checkpoints be dismantled.\n\nIn response, Harold Frazier, the chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe, stated, \"We will not apologize for being an island of safety in a sea of uncertainty and death.\" He added, \"You continuing to interfere in our efforts to do what science and facts dictate seriously undermines our ability to protect everyone on the reservation.\"\n\nOglala Sioux President Julian Bear Runner expressed concern over Governor Noem's decision, stating it \"threatened the sovereign interest of the Oglala people.\"\n\nThe main purpose of the checkpoints, according to Mr. Frazier, is to monitor and track the virus. He told CNN, \"We want to ensure that people coming from 'hotspots' or highly infected areas, we ask them to go around our land.\" He further explained, \"With the lack of resources we have medically, this is our best tool we have right now to try to prevent [the spread of Covid-19].\"\n\nThe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe operates an eight-bed facility on the reservation, with no intensive care unit for the 12,000 people residing there. The nearest critical care facilities are three hours away. South Dakota is one of a handful of US states that have not issued stay-at-home orders to their residents. As of Sunday, there were 198 cases of Covid-19 among Native Americans in the state, according to state health department figures quoted by CNN. The state has more than 3,500 confirmed cases and at least 34 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US has the highest number of virus deaths and cases in the world, but it also has one of the biggest populations, and widespread testing is being conducted.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Constitutionality of Independent Payment Advisory Board in Obamacare Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially reshape the nation's healthcare industry, a new petition will be filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, challenging the constitutionality of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The case, Coons v. Lew, aims to review the most sweeping government power grab in the law, which establishes an unaccountable health care rationing agency.\n\nThe Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is tasked with controlling Medicare costs. The law grants IPAB broad authority to implement price controls, levy taxes, and take whatever action its members consider \"related to the Medicare program.\" This group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats is immune from control by the president, Congress, or the courts, making it the most extreme consolidation of government power in American history.\n\nThe law requires IPAB to publish annual \"recommendations\" for controlling Medicare spending, but these recommendations automatically become law without the president's signature, and the law bars Congress from stopping them unless Congress presents an alternative plan that can meet IPAB's spending reductions. In fact, the law even prohibits Congress from abolishing IPAB outside of a short window in 2017, and repeal must be supported by an unprecedented supermajority. Moreover, the law blocks the courts from reviewing IPAB decisions.\n\nThe administration argues that IPAB is no danger because Obamacare explicitly prohibits it from rationing health care. However, the law does not define \"rationing care,\" and it remains unclear whether IPAB's actions could be considered rationing if they set the price of a lifesaving surgery so low that no doctor would perform it or taxed a drug or device so much that no patient could pay for it.\n\nProponents argue that it was necessary to surrender Congress's role in setting Medicare policy because Congress cannot stand up to the pressure it receives when members try to cut Medicare spending and services. IPAB insulates lawmakers from political pressure and makes it possible to make cuts without facing voter backlash.\n\nHowever, critics argue that in the case of IPAB, the cure is far more dangerous than the disease. Nearly 25 years ago, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia warned that failure to respect constitutional separation of powers could tempt Congress \"to create an expert Medical Commission... to dispose of such thorny, 'no-win' political issues as the withholding of life-support systems in federally funded hospitals.\"\n\nThe Constitution's authors intended public pressure to be a key feature of our constitutional government, not a bug, because it serves as an important check on power. Legislators are responsible to their constituents and checked by the other branches of government. Bureaucrats face no such accountability.\n\nEarlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed this challenge to IPAB's constitutionality, saying that because President Obama has not yet appointed anyone to IPAB, it would decline to rule until IPAB flexes its muscles. It is the unconstitutional lawmaking process itself, though, not any particular edict, that must be reviewed.\n\nThe father of the Constitution, James Madison, cautioned against ceding unchecked power to any branch of government or agency because \"enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.\" The Constitution encourages democratic oversight by explicitly vesting lawmaking power in Congress, not independent agencies.\n\nChristina Sandefur, a senior lawyer at the Goldwater Institute, is among those calling for the Supreme Court to take up the IPAB case. Never before has Congress gone to such an extreme length to relinquish so much power over such an important matter to an agency that is not answerable to the American people.",
    " Title: Russian National Charged for Conspiracy to Interfere in 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nA Russian national, Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, has been charged by the U.S. for conspiring to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the FBI and the Department of Justice. Khusyaynova, a 44-year-old from St. Petersburg, is alleged to have participated in a conspiracy to \"sow discord in the U.S. political system and to undermine faith in our democratic institutions.\"\n\nThe government claims that the conspiracy is part of a 2016 influence operation that dates back to at least May 2014. Khusyaynova, who served as the chief accountant of \"Project Lakhta,\" reportedly oversaw a $35 million budget from 2014 to 2018, which covered expenses related to activists, social media advertising, and promoting news postings on social networks. The Justice Department states that the proposed operating budget for 2018 alone was over $10 million.\n\nJohn Carlin, former head of the Justice Department's National Security division, and author of \"Dawn of the Code War,\" told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Russia is spending millions to undermine American democracy. \"We're under attack now, and our elections are at risk,\" he said. \"There is no way this is taking place without the knowledge of Putin himself.\"\n\nThe indictment describes a large-scale operation, overseen by a management group, with several departments, including graphics and design, analysis, search engine optimization, IT, and finance. The conspiracy allegedly attempted to appear as American political activists, while hiding the fact that they were Russian. The indictment states that the conspiracy \"inflamed passions\" on topics including immigration, gun control, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women's March, and the NFL national anthem controversy.\n\nThe conspiracy reportedly provided guidance to social media writers, suggesting that people of color who are LGBT are \"less sophisticated\" than those who are white. The indictment also states that infographics \"work well among LGBT and their liberal allies,\" but not so well with conservatives.\n\nPresident Trump, when addressing the news with reporters, stated that it had nothing to do with his campaign. \"It had nothing to do with my campaign,\" the president said. \"All of the hackers and all everybody that you see \u2014 nothing to do with my campaign. If they're hackers, a lot of them probably liked Hillary Clinton better than me.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, in a rare joint statement, the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies issued a warning against ongoing campaigns by Russia, China, and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies. The statement noted that there had not been any evidence, to date, of a compromise or disruption of election infrastructure.",
    " Title: Senator Bernie Sanders Accuses President Trump of Lying, Highlights Real Crises Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a live-streamed response to President Donald Trump's address, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, branded the President a liar and cited numerous instances of misstatements made by the President during his speech, particularly regarding immigration and the border wall.\n\n\"It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"In his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.\"\n\nSanders then addressed the pressing issues of millions of Americans who lack health insurance, elderly people without retirement savings, and those burdened with crippling student debt, among others. He argued that these challenges were more critical than the issue of illegal immigration.\n\n\"We don't need to create artificial crises,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"We have enough real crises.\"\n\nPresident Trump is scheduled to visit McAllen, Texas, on Thursday, while Democrats plan to introduce a series of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service to allow tax refunds to be paid, and the Agriculture Department to ensure food assistance and farmer support payments can be made.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the I.R.S. will be the first to reopen, followed by the Agriculture and Interior Departments, including national parks, on Thursday. Transportation and housing programs are set to reopen on Friday.\n\n\"We are going to, daily, urge and take efforts to open up the government,\" said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. \"Whatever problems confront us, they are exacerbated\u2014not relieved\u2014by shutting down government.\"\n\nA group of Senate Democrats spent Tuesday evening taking turns on the Senate floor, urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to bring up the House-passed legislation to reopen the government. The dozen Democrats, led by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, aim to highlight the impact of the shutdown on federal workers and those who benefit from government programs.",
    " Title: Bill Maher Apologizes for Using Racial Slur on 'Real Time' and Faces Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to address the controversy surrounding his use of a racial slur on HBO's Real Time last week, Bill Maher offered an on-air apology during the show's opening segment on Friday. The talk show host engaged in an extended conversation about race with political activist and Georgetown professor Michael E. Dyson, aiming to clear the air over his use of the racial epithet during an interview with Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).\n\nMaher expressed remorse, stating, \"I wanted you to come by here because I want you to school me. I did a bad thing.\" Dyson responded, \"A very bad thing.\"\n\nMaher acknowledged the harm caused by the slur, stating, \"That word, I do not care who you are, has caused pain.\" He added that his apology was sincere and that he regretted using the word, regardless of any intentions behind it.\n\nThe entire conversation between Maher and Dyson can be watched below.\n\nLater in the show, hip-hop artist turned actor Ice Cube addressed Maher's use of the racial slur. Ice Cube said, \"When I hear my homies say it, it doesn't feel like venom. When I hear a white person say it, it's like a knife.\"\n\nLast weekend, Maher issued an apology in which he admitted \"the word was offensive\" and expressed regret for using it. HBO called the comment \"inexcusable and tasteless\" and announced they would edit that part out for future airings of the episode.\n\nHowever, the fallout did not stop there. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) canceled his appearance on Friday's episode. He was to have appeared in the same post-monologue, single-guest interview in which Sasse participated.\n\nIn an interview that aired Thursday on SiriusXM's Family Politics, Franken, who still considers Maher a friend, said, \"He's been around long enough to know that that's not a word white people can use. It just is not. And he should have known that.\" Franken added that he did not want to be associated with the controversy before appearing on the show.",
    " Title: Psychological Research Suggests News Media Contributes to Selection Bias and Polarization in Society\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political and social climate of the United States, it is evident that the nation is deeply divided. Daily news reports highlight political infighting and racial bias, with fatal shootings and other incidents that seem to reinforce these divisions. However, a growing body of psychological research suggests that these stories may be fraught with a dangerous selection bias, making people less sympathetic to those outside their perceived in-group.\n\nAccording to David Pietraszewski, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, this tendency to categorize and form groups based on political views and race is an inherent aspect of how our brains work. In a recent study, Pietraszewski and a team of evolutionary psychologists found that politics and race were the most significant factors in how people categorize themselves, with these factors often demarcating groups in a mutually exclusive manner.\n\nJohn Tooby, study co-author and professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, explains that successful politicians, such as Benjamin Disraeli, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Barack Obama, do not need to be ethnically similar to the majority of their supporters. \"Coalition is the real coin of the evolved mind, not race,\" Tooby said.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that news stories do perpetuate certain stereotypes based on race. Temple Northup, an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire's Jack J. Valenti School of Communication, recently investigated the extent to which news media can influence people's implicit racial bias. Northup found that reading a newspaper about poor race relations or watching a newscast about racial tension increased people's implicit bias on the Implicit Association Test (IAT).\n\nNorthup's research suggests that the quality of our thoughts is only as good as the information they are fed. In other words, the news we consume plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions and biases. Given that long-term exposure to media stereotypes seems to influence evaluations of racial and ethnic groups, more research is needed to understand this implicit effect.\n\nPietraszewski suggests that consumers of news have a simple and effective way to avoid the traps of selection biases: cooperation. By crossing racial and political boundaries, people can reduce racial discrimination and political polarization. \"Reducing racial discrimination or political polarization will be no easier or harder than changing patterns of cooperation,\" Pietraszewski said.\n\nIn conclusion, the emerging research suggests that news media plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions and biases, often reinforcing selection biases that can lead to social and political polarization. It is up to the viewer and the reader to look past these biases by exercising empathy and seeking out cooperative opportunities that cross racial and political boundaries.",
    " Title: Washington State Legalizes Marijuana Use, but Driving Under the Influence Remains Illegal\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of Thursday, marijuana use is legal in Washington state, but driving under the influence remains a punishable offense. This fine line is a challenge that law enforcement and prosecutors are navigating, as they strive to enforce the new law effectively.\n\n\"I don't feel we are in uncharted territory\u2014I know we are,\" said Seattle Deputy City Attorney Craig Sims. Possessing marijuana is now legal in Washington, and soon in Colorado. In 17 other states, marijuana for medical use is easily obtainable. However, unlike alcohol, there is no national legal limit. Some states have a zero-tolerance policy, while others, like Colorado and California, leave it up to the discretion of the arresting officer.\n\nResearch indicates that marijuana can cause dizziness and slowed reaction time, affecting coordination and judgment. Drivers are more likely to drift and swerve while they're high, according to research in the Netherlands. \"First and most important is an inability or reduced ability to divide one's attention,\" said California Highway Patrol drug recognition expert Sgt. Tyler Eccles. \"Another effect of those who drive under the influence of marijuana is a reduced ability to perceive time and distance.\"\n\nSupporters of legalization argue that pot is less debilitating than alcohol, and that pot smokers are more aware of being impaired than those who drink. This debate was evident this summer in Colorado, which considered adopting a standard of five nanograms per milliliter of blood\u2014above that would have qualified as DUI-D, or driving while under the influence of drugs.\n\nHowever, the pot lobby successfully argued in Colorado that innocent people could be found guilty based on prior use, and yet show no signs of impairment. The legislature there agreed and defeated the bill. In Washington state, advocates knew the ballot measure would only pass with voters\u2014especially those in conservative eastern Washington\u2014with the 5-nanogram standard.\n\n\"Because we are early on in the research phase, it is very difficult to tell if that 5-nanogram level will change, similar to how DUI standards have evolved over the years,\" said Sims. \"There absolutely needs to be some public education campaign to educate John Q. citizen on the effects of marijuana.\"\n\nThe question remains, how much pot does it take to reach five nanograms? Police say it is impossible to know since THC concentrations vary based on where and how the marijuana is grown, and how much is consumed. \"People always want to know how much does it take to reach five nanograms,\" said Eccles. \"For anyone to say two hits or dosages get me to five nanograms, it is nearly impossible to make that determination.\"\n\nIn practice, in Washington, police will still have to observe signs of impaired driving before pulling someone over. Drivers will likely undergo some type of field test. If the officer believes the driver is impaired, they would be taken to a hospital where blood would be drawn. Tests above five nanograms would automatically subject the driver to a DUI conviction. With no priors, they may receive a day in jail and a fine.",
    " Title: Persecution and the Dissident Baker: A Call for Understanding and Tolerance in Colorado\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Colorado, a small bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, has been at the center of a series of legal battles since 2012. The baker, Jack Phillips, a Christian, has declined to bake wedding cakes for same-sex couples, leading to three legal attacks on his business.\n\nPhillips, a local baker, found himself in the eye of a storm when he declined to bake a wedding cake for a homosexual couple in 2012. Instead of opting for a bakery down the street, the couple brought in the state government to try to force Phillips to bake the cake. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark decision in 2018, ruled that Colorado's Civil Rights Commission had acted with \"religious hostility\" towards Phillips. A second action against Phillips was dropped when he countersued.\n\nAutumn Scardina, the complainant in the second action against Phillips, is now pursuing a third legal action, having asked for a birthday cake to celebrate a gender transition.\n\nThe ongoing legal battles against Phillips have sparked a debate about the balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Critics argue that these legal actions are a form of harassment, aimed at coercing Phillips to conform to a particular viewpoint.\n\nThe legal doctrine of \"public accommodations\" was first used as a civil-rights matter in the case of racial segregation. However, the situation of gay Americans in the 21st century is not comparable to that of African Americans in the 1940s. The exclusion of black Americans from public life, given the legacy of slavery, severely impacted their lives and opportunities. In contrast, accommodating the religious principles of those with traditional views of marriage requires only a symbolic concession.\n\nThis ongoing legal harassment, according to the article, is not aimed at integrating gay Americans into civil life or enabling them to organize their own affairs. Instead, it is a form of bullying and coercion aimed at enforcing conformity. The term \"dissident baker\" highlights the political nature of the conflict, speaking eloquently to the current societal climate.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that this persecution is unjust and should be addressed with legal and political means to stop it. A call for understanding and tolerance is made, urging people in Colorado to grow up and move beyond this divisive issue.",
    " Title: US Implements Ban on Mint and Fruit-Flavored E-Cigarettes Amid Health Concerns for Teens\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the growing concern over vaping among teenagers, the US has announced a nationwide ban on mint and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The ban applies to cartridge-based e-cigarettes, including popular pods sold by Juul. The administration will continue to allow menthol and tobacco flavors, as well as fruit flavors delivered in other ways.\n\nThe decision, which has been under consideration for over a year, follows similar rules passed by several states. South Korea, India, and Brazil are among the dozens of countries that have announced sweeping vaping bans, while others, like China, have imposed restrictions.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stated that the Trump administration aims to strike a balance between offering adults an alternative to traditional cigarettes and addressing concerns about the growing addiction to e-cigarettes among teenagers. \"By prioritizing enforcement against the products that are most widely used by children, our action today seeks to strike the right public health balance,\" he said.\n\nThe action comes amid a health crisis, with 55 deaths and over 2,500 hospitalizations linked to vaping, according to US health regulators. Investigators believe vitamin E acetate, which is sometimes added to marijuana vaping products, is playing a role in the crisis.\n\nInitially, President Trump announced in September that the US would ban all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco, but the administration has since softened its stance following industry pushback. \"We have to protect our families. At the same time, it's a big industry. We want to protect the industry,\" Mr. Trump said this week.\n\nJuul, the largest e-cigarette company in the US, had already withdrawn its flavored pods from the market, but Thursday's action forces competitors to make a similar move within 30 days. Concerns have been raised that teens may switch to menthol if other options are eliminated, but officials have stated they will take action against menthol and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes if the Food and Drug Administration sees a rise in their use among teens.\n\nThe US also recently raised the age for purchasing tobacco products to 21. E-cigarettes are also subject to these rules.",
    " Title: \"U.S. Social Security: The Looming Challenge of Paying 77% of Scheduled Benefits by 2034\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning, the U.S. government's annual Social Security statement forecasts that by 2034, the payroll taxes collected will be sufficient to pay only about 77 percent of scheduled benefits. This impending crisis, often referred to as an \"economic tsunami,\" is a predictable consequence of the current system, as the ratio of workers paying taxes to support each Social Security beneficiary is set to decline significantly from 3:1 to 2:1 by 2034.\n\nThe issue is further exacerbated by the increasing number of beneficiaries. By 2034, the total number of beneficiaries is projected to reach 87 million, a 41 percent increase from the number in 2017. The aging Baby Boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is central to the issue, with Pew Research predicting 72 million Baby Boomers in 2019.\n\nBeginning in 2026, the so-called \"bulge years\" will commence, marking the period when all Baby Boomers, including the youngest born in 1964, will have turned 62 and be eligible to collect retirement benefits. Eight years later, in 2034, when the 1964 crop celebrates their 70th birthdays and the oldest Boomers turn 88, the \"bulge\" is projected to burst, leaving only 77 percent of benefits to be paid.\n\nThe cost of Social Security is already a significant burden on the U.S. government, currently the second-largest annual budget expense at $ 967.5 billion. By 2022, the cost is projected to reach $ 1.166 trillion, surpassing Medicare/Medicaid at $ 1.138 trillion. The liability of Social Security is currently $ 17 trillion but is set to grow to $ 24 trillion by 2022.\n\nThe question is when and how will our elected leaders address this looming crisis. The answer, according to experts, is bold leadership while the economic tsunami is still offshore. Without legislative action, other government benefit programs, such as disability benefits, could also face significant cuts in the coming decades. The U.S. government's total unfunded liabilities, including Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, federal-employee and veterans benefits, and debt held by the public, currently stand at $ 113 trillion and are projected to increase to $ 140 trillion by 2022.\n\nAs the economic tsunami approaches, it is crucial for our elected leaders to take action and reform the Social Security system to ensure the financial security of future generations.",

Army Col. Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman, described these incursions as \"small probes.\"\n\nCol. Warren stated on Friday evening that these incidents mark a \"handful of incursions\" into Ukrainian airspace. He further emphasized that the Pentagon is urging Russia to take immediate steps to reduce tension along the Ukraine border.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel has reportedly attempted to contact Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu regarding the escalating tension between the two countries, but to no avail. Mr. Shoigu's announcement on Thursday of Russia's plan to engage in new military exercises near the Ukraine border has raised concern among Defense Department officials.\n\nThe military move, according to Mr. Shoigu, is in response to ongoing NATO training exercises in Poland and the death of at least two pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine. Currently, the country has \"a broad array of forces aligned along the Ukrainian border,\" Col. Warren said.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's acting Defense Minister Mikhail Koval has disputed these claims, stating on Saturday that neither Russian troops nor aircraft have crossed into Ukraine during a military exercise. The Pentagon has yet to comment on Mr. Koval's contradicting statement.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that high-level contact between the Obama administration and the Kremlin has ceased. The last known conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin was on April 14, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nDespite this, Col. Warren clarified that the relationship between the United States and Russia has not completely frozen. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey reportedly spoke with his counterpart, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Gen. Valery Gerasimov, on the same day.",
    " Title: Commerce Department Rolls Back Newsprint Tariffs on Canadian Imports, but Publishers Call for Complete Abolition\n\nThe Commerce Department has announced a rollback of the tariff it imposed on newsprint imported from Canada, reducing the rate by as much as a third. However, publishers are still pressing for the complete abolition of the tariffs, arguing that they are causing harm to the printing and publishing sectors, as well as local communities.\n\nThe initial tariffs, imposed in May, added up to 30 percent to the price of newsprint from Canada. The new tariffs range from 8 percent to 20 percent. David Chavern, president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, an umbrella industry group, stated, \"These import duties on newsprint have already caused job losses in the printing and publishing sectors and have resulted in decreased news coverage in local communities.\"\n\nPaul Boyle, head of Stop Tariffs on Printers & Publishers (STOPP), echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It's a step in the right direction, but these tariffs are still causing damage and need to be repealed to protect newspapers.\"\n\nNewsprint, the second biggest cost to publishers after workers, is now close to $800 a metric ton, according to Boyle. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is set to cut its print edition to five days, from seven, making it one of the largest big-city dailies to take such a dramatic step in response to the increased costs.\n\nOther papers are reducing the number of pages, chopping the trim size, and in some cases, dropping Sunday comics. The tariff is also affecting advertisers, who are printing fewer circulars to insert into papers, Boyle said.\n\nBoyle argued, \"The financial harm [to US paper mills] is coming from a decade-long shift to digital advertising, not from Canadian paper.\" He also noted that North American newsprint demand has decreased by 75 percent from 2000 to 2018. With tariffs forcing publishers to use less paper, demand will further erode, potentially harming the very paper producers the tariffs are intended to protect, Boyle warned.\n\nThe International Trade Commission is expected to make a ruling on the tariffs on Aug. 28, and Boyle is hopeful that the body will put an end to the tariffs entirely.",
    " Title: Obama Nominates Anthony Foxx as Transportation Secretary, Boosting Diversity in Second Term Cabinet\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to boost diversity within his second term Cabinet, President Barack Obama has nominated Anthony Foxx to become the transportation secretary. The nomination, announced on Monday, makes Foxx the first African-American pick for Obama's second term cabinet.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Foxx would bring to two the number of African-Americans currently heading Cabinet agencies under Obama, joining Attorney General Eric Holder. In his first term, two other African-Americans \u2013 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson \u2013 served in Obama's Cabinet.\n\nThe transportation secretary post comes with vast oversight responsibility over the nation's roads, airports, railroads, and seaways. The White House highlighted Foxx's achievements in opening a new runway at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and his championing of a new streetcar system in the Queen City. He also played a significant role in last summer's Democratic National Convention, which drew tens of thousands to Charlotte without any major logistical hiccups.\n\n\"As mayor of one of America's most vibrant cities, Anthony Foxx knows firsthand that investing in world-class infrastructure is vital to creating good jobs and ensuring American businesses can grow and compete in the global economy,\" the White House official said.\n\nThe nomination of Foxx is also expected to help dispel the image of Obama naming only white men to top posts in his administration. The criticism began earlier this year, when the first Cabinet picks of Obama's second term \u2013 Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew \u2013 were all white men.\n\nAfter taking heat, Obama named several women to prominent roles, including Sylvia Mathews Burwell as director of his budget office and Mary Schapiro as the chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, groups like the Congressional Black Caucus cried foul, saying the lack of African-American nominees amounted to a snub for his most ardent supporters.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, said in a weekly address for the CBC that Obama \"has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.\"\n\n\"President Obama has selected the lowest number of African American Cabinet members in 38 years, and fewer than his Republican predecessor George Bush who nominated four African Americans to his Cabinet,\" Thompson said on April 9.\n\nThe CBC's chairwoman, Rep. Marcia Fudge, wrote in a letter to Obama that \"the people you have chosen to appoint in this new term have hardly been reflective of this country's diversity.\"\n\nObama himself disputed the notion his inner circle was lacking diversity, urging patience at a news conference in January.\n\n\"I'm very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history,\" he said on January 14. \"And I intend to continue that, because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, you're going to end up with a diverse staff and a diverse team.\"\n\n\"I think until you've seen what my overall team looks like, it's premature to assume that somehow we're going backwards,\" he added later. \"We're not going backwards, we're going forward.\"",

The payments were for the publication of \"China Watch,\" a supplement produced by China Daily that often contains a pro-Beijing spin on contemporary news events.\n\nThe supplements, which are designed to resemble real news articles, have been published in several other newspapers, including The New York Times ($50,000), Foreign Policy ($240,000), The Des Moines Register ($34,600), and CQ-Roll Call ($76,000).\n\nIn addition to these payments, China Daily spent a total of $11,002,628 on advertising in U.S. newspapers and another $265,822 on advertising with Twitter. The Chinese outlet also paid out more than $7.6 million to newspapers and printing companies for its newspaper for U.S.-based readers, the Justice Department's filings show.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle, and The Boston Globe are among the newspapers listed as clients of China Daily. The Chinese outlet paid the Los Angeles Times $657,523 for printing services, according to the FARA filings.\n\nChina Daily has been required to disclose its activities semi-annually under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) for years. The most recent filing, submitted on June 1, is the first to include detailed breakdowns of payments to American news outlets. The outlet disclosed those expenditures for the period between November 2016 and April 2020.\n\nPro-democracy groups have long warned about the Chinese government's attempts to push propaganda through American news outlets. Freedom House and the Hoover Institution have both drawn attention to China Daily's paid inserts in reports on the Chinese government's efforts to influence the media.\n\nChina Daily and other Beijing-controlled propaganda mills have come under intense scrutiny amid the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese government officials have tried to divert blame for the spread of the virus to the United States and other Western nations. Many of the regime-controlled outlets, including China Daily, have echoed the communist leaders' talking points.\n\nChina Daily has slowed its advertising expenditures in recent months, the filings show. The Chinese outlet last paid The Washington Post for advertising in December 2019. Its payments to The Wall Street Journal have been less than half their average amount since February 2020, the documents show.\n\nChina Daily did not respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts to End Government Shutdown as Trump Demands Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. senators have made a renewed attempt to end a 34-day-long government shutdown through a temporary funding bill on Thursday, but President Donald Trump has demanded a \"down payment\" for a border wall that Democrats reject.\n\nAfter the Republican-led Senate failed to advance two measures to reopen shuttered agencies, Democratic and Republican lawmakers urged quick passage of a three-week, stopgap funding bill to create time for talks on border security.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders stated that such a measure would only work \"if there is a large down payment on the wall.\" However, a spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats had made clear to Republicans that \"they will not support funding for the wall.\"\n\nTrump, who initiated the shutdown with his demand for $5.7 billion in funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, told reporters after the votes in the Senate: \"We have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier, and if we don't have that, it's just not going to work.\"\n\nTrump added that if Schumer and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell come to a \"reasonable\" agreement to end the partial government shutdown, \"I would support it, yes.\"\n\nMcConnell stated late on Thursday that talks were ongoing. \"At least we're talking. I think that's better than it was before,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's demand for a large down payment on a border wall \"is not a reasonable agreement.\"\n\nThe shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers without pay and struggling to make ends meet, as the effects on government services and the economy reverberate nationwide.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had spoken to Trump about a short-term funding bill. \"All of us believe if we have three weeks with the government open, that we could find a way forward to produce a bill that he would sign, that would be good for everybody in the country,\" Graham said on the Senate floor.\n\nEarlier, a bill backed by Trump to end the shutdown by funding the wall and a separate bill supported by Democrats to reopen shuttered agencies without such funding did not get the votes required to advance in the 100-member chamber.\n\nTrump has touted Republican unity during the longest shutdown in U.S. history, but in a sign of cracks in that resolve, or just a desire for compromise, six Republican senators voted with Democrats on their measure to reopen government agencies temporarily without money for a wall.\n\nPelosi told reporters earlier she was willing to meet with Trump to discuss the shutdown. Her comments came one day after she essentially withdrew an invitation for Trump to give his State of the Union in the House chamber next Tuesday, saying that would not happen until the shutdown ended. Trump, who had planned to come despite the shutdown and considered giving the speech at another venue, conceded late on Wednesday and said he would deliver the speech in the House in the \"near future.\"\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday urged furloughed federal workers to seek loans to pay their bills while adding in a CNBC interview that he could not understand why they were having trouble getting by.\n\n\"Is this the 'Let them eat cake' kind of attitude or 'Call your father for money?' or 'This is character building for you?'\" Pelosi asked at a news conference.\n\nShe said she did not understand why Ross would make the comment \"as hundreds of thousands of men and women are about to miss a second paycheck tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump responded to Pelosi's comments on Twitter, stating, \"Nancy just said she 'just doesn't understand why?' Very simply, without a Wall it all doesn't work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime, Human Trafficking, Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!\"",
    " Title: The Green New Deal: A New Approach to Agriculture and Climate Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, approximately 40% of the land is dedicated to farming and ranching, making it a significant contributor to the nation's food production. This agricultural system is heavily influenced by the Farm Bill, which allocates nearly $15 billion annually on subsidies and $10 billion on conservation measures. The food system's carbon footprint can be significantly reduced through changes in cropping, fertilizing, irrigation, and waste management, practices that are often more suitable for small farming.\n\nTransitioning towards a less carbon-intensive food production system, however, would require challenging the status quo of big American agriculture. The Green New Deal, while not the only approach, represents a broad ambition that outlines the future battlegrounds in the climate change discourse.\n\nThe Green New Deal's objective is to reshape the environmental impact by reworking the economy, leading to competing visions about who should benefit and the type of economy we should build. Centrist proposals focus on promoting investment in new technologies, with profits going to private researchers and manufacturers. On the other hand, Trumpist nationalism, if it survives climate denialism, may double down on supporting national energy industries and building border walls against climate refugees. To the left of the Green New Deal, there are louder calls for nationalizing fossil fuels to keep them in the ground.\n\nThe idea that environmental policy can be separated from the larger economic order or from fairness debates is a recent one, a product of a technocratic period in American politics. In 1970, Senator Edmund Muskie, a Democrat from Maine and the lead drafter of the Clean Air Act, argued that \"man's environment\" included \"the shape of the communities in which he lives.\" He believed that a society that tolerates toxic neighborhoods and jobs has no future.\n\nIn the following three years, the country adopted the most ambitious and effective environmental legislation in its history, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Senator Muskie's approach remains a model of visionary environmental lawmaking. The Green New Deal, in many ways, is a rediscovery of this radicalism for the Anthropocene era.\n\nJedediah Britton-Purdy, a professor of law at Columbia and the author of \"After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene,\" continues to advocate for such visionary changes.

    " Title: Islamic Extremists Seize Radisson Hotel in Mali, Dozens of Hostages Taken, Multiple Deaths Reported\n\nA series of events unfolded on Friday in the Malian capital of Bamako, as heavily armed Islamic extremists stormed the Radisson Blu hotel, taking dozens of hostages and engaging in a more than seven-hour siege with Malian troops, US, and French special forces.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the siege resulted in at least 20 deaths, including one American, and the freeing of many of the terrified captives. A Malian military commander reported that two gunmen were also killed during the siege.\n\nThe ordeal began when ten gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu hotel, shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" or \"God is great\" in Arabic, before firing on hotel guards. The Malian military, with assistance from United Nations peacekeeping troops, currently have the hotel surrounded.\n\nAs of now, three deaths have been confirmed, with two being Malian and one a French national, according to CNN. It appears that those who have been released were made to recite Koranic verses first, as reported by Reuters. The gunmen are reportedly making their way through the hotel floor by floor.\n\nThe Rezidor Hotel Group, which operates the Radisson Blu, stated that 30 of the hostages were hotel staff, and the other 140 were guests. The 190-room hotel, located near government ministries and diplomatic offices, is popular among foreigners in the former French colony. Turkish Airlines reported that six of its crew members are part of the hostage situation, and Chinese, French, and Belgian nationals are also believed to be inside.\n\nNo immediate claim of responsibility has been made, but this year has seen an increase in jihadist violence across Mali. An attack on a restaurant in Bamako in March was the first time the capital had been attacked in years.\n\nIn 2012, after a coup in Bamako, Mali's north fell under the control of Islamic extremists who took advantage of a Tuareg uprising. In 2013, the French Army took control of the north, and a UN-brokered peace deal was signed with Tuareg separatists.\n\nFrance and other Western nations have been working with the Malian government to prevent the Islamist militants from regaining a foothold in the north. A UN spokesman stated that the Radisson Blu was host to a large delegation of UN workers involved in the ongoing peace process.\n\nIn August, nine people, including four members of the UN mission, were killed in a hotel attack in the central town of Sevare after heavily armed gunmen entered a hotel popular with European military officers. The attack was significant because the popular tourist town was the demarcation line between government-controlled areas of Mali and those that were controlled by Islamist militants, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn August, The \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that there were signs that militants were strategically moving south to places like Bamako, after having been confined to cities such as Timbuktu in the north.\n\n\"It's a troubling sign that the armed Islamist groups are intent on stepping up the pressure both on the Malian government and on the UN and French presence,\" Bruce Whitehouse, a Mali expert and associate professor at Lehigh University, told AP. \"They want to show they are not just contained within the north and that they're not afraid to confront their primary enemies where they're strongest.\"",
    " Title: Texas Seeks to Exclude Planned Parenthood from Federal Family Planning Funds, Potentially Setting National Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas is poised to establish a new national precedent for states aiming to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, as the state requests federal approval to exclude these providers from receiving some federal family planning dollars. This move could pave the way for other states to follow suit.\n\nJennifer Popik, federal legislative director with National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group with affiliates in all 50 states, stated, \"This would have implications nationwide if this gets approved.\" Popik further added, \"For an administration with a pro-life focus, this is something they could do to divert funding from Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nThe push in Texas is the latest effort against the women's healthcare provider, which stands to lose federal funding for one year under the Republican healthcare bill currently under consideration in the Senate. Republicans have long sought to block Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed by the government for medical services, with most federal funding coming through Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor.\n\nThe GOP's primary objection to Planned Parenthood is its provision of abortions, though the Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for the procedure. President Trump has indicated his support for efforts to block federal funds to Planned Parenthood. In April, he signed a bill passed by Congress that rolled back an Obama-era rule that banned states from withholding separate federal family planning funds, known as Title X Funding, from providers for political reasons.\n\nTexas is essentially seeking federal Medicaid funding it lost four years ago when it excluded Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from participating in a family planning program for low-income women who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. The Obama administration halted the funding to Texas\u2014about $35 million a year\u2014stating that federal law requires states to allow Medicaid patients their choice of \"any willing provider,\" including those that provide abortions.\n\nTexas, in turn, created its own state-funded program, called \"Healthy Texas Women.\" Now the state is asking the Trump administration for the federal money back, while still exempting abortion providers. If approved, the program would take effect for five years beginning Sept. 1. The federal comment period is open until Aug. 4, after which the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) would make a decision.\n\nKinsey Hasstedt, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a liberal reproductive rights group, stated, \"If CMS were to approve this waiver and offer federal funding for this program, it would open the floodgates for this to be implemented in other states.\" Hasstedt further added, \"It would offer a stamp of approval to violate decades-old Medicaid policy and federal law, which prohibits excluding Medicaid providers from these programs.\"\n\nSince 1972, family planning services have been a mandatory benefit for Medicaid recipients, with healthcare providers reimbursed by the federal government at a 90 percent matching rate, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the 1990s, several states, led by California, sought waivers to create programs to serve low-income women not eligible for Medicaid. Now, 26 states have similar family planning programs, mostly funded by the federal government.\n\nTwo states\u2014Iowa and Missouri\u2014recently created their own state-funded programs that exclude Planned Parenthood. Republican lawmakers in Iowa agreed this year to give up millions of federal dollars to create a state-run family planning program that excludes abortion providers and their affiliates. Four Planned Parenthood centers in the state are now closed due to the lost funding. Missouri lawmakers, meanwhile, decided in April to reject more than $8 million in federal funding the state was going to receive for its family planning program and will create a state-funded program that bans abortion providers.\n\nThe reduced funding in Texas has led to some negative consequences, including a drop in women receiving services. The state also has the fourth-highest birth rate in the U.S. State officials hope that getting the federal money back will improve the Healthy Texas Women program. \"Increasing access to women's health and family planning services is a priority in Texas,\" officials wrote in their application. \"The [Healthy Texas Women] demonstration seeks to increase access to family services to avert unintended pregnancies.\"\n\nHowever, experts warn that more money will not help the problem, as community health centers in the state are already facing limited resources and facilities. Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, and her colleagues concluded in an analysis that Texas's proposal would diminish access to care for low-income women because health centers cannot grow fast enough to replace services provided by Planned Parenthood and other centers.\n\nIf the Texas request is approved, the issue could end up in the courts. Federal law states that Medicaid beneficiaries may go to any provider who is \"qualified to perform the service,\" and there are questions about whether Texas's proposal would violate that. Courts have previously sided with Planned Parenthood in cases where states have tried to block the organization from receiving Medicaid funding.\n\nMara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, stated, \"We are very concerned about this proposal and how it might be received by this administration, which has been very hostile to women's health and to women's healthcare providers like Planned Parenthood.\" Gandal-Powers further added, \"We're very concerned, but it's hard to go down the road of what might happen.\"\n\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Danielle Wells called the proposal an \"underhanded attempt to cut off care at Planned Parenthood with devastating consequences for our patients.\" Wells further stated, \"Texas paints a grim picture of what healthcare access could look like nationwide if the Trump administration approves this waiver.\"",
    " Title: Taylor University Faces Backlash Over Mike Pence's Commencement Speech Invitation\n\nArticle:\n\nTaylor University, a small evangelical Christian school, is facing pushback from students and alumni after inviting Vice President Mike Pence to speak at this year's commencement ceremony. Over 3,300 people have signed a change.org petition to rescind Pence's invitation, citing the Trump-Pence Administration's policies as \"not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.\"\n\nOne Taylor graduate expressed their dismay, stating, \"The school should be ashamed... I am physically shaking... I feel personally attacked.\" However, not all alumni agree, and Taylor officials have stated they are standing by their decision.\n\nThe controversy has escalated as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential hopeful and an openly gay man, criticized Pence during an event hosted by the LGBTQ Victory Fund. Buttigieg discussed his sexual orientation, saying, \"If being gay was a choice, it was made far, far above my pay grade... That\u2019s the thing that I wish the Mike Pence\u2019s of the world would understand \u2013 that if you have a problem with who I am \u2013 your problem is not with me, your quarrel sir, is with my creator.\"\n\nKevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumnus, defended the school and Pence on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday morning, stating that the outraged alumni and students are mistaking disagreement on political issues with personal attacks. Holtsberry also thanked the school for \"standing firm\" and not pulling Pence's invitation.\n\nHoltsberry further explained, \"The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe. His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion.\"\n\nTaylor University has defended the decision, with President Paul Lowell Haines praising Pence as a \"good friend to the University over many years\" and \"a Christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates.\"\n\nIn a statement, Taylor University spokesman, James Garringer, said, \"We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.\" The university has stated that they encourage positive, respectful, and meaningful dialogue and aim to foster an intentional Christian community.",
    " Title: The Great American Regime Struggle: A Clash of Ideologies and the Pursuit of National Identity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the United States, a profound divide has emerged, often referred to as a \"cold civil war\" or a \"culture war.\" This conflict, according to the Claremont Institute's Angelo Codevilla, is not merely a disagreement over policy but a fundamental disagreement over the very essence of America and its principles.\n\nThe divide is between those who cherish America's history, culture, principles, and people, and those who view the United States as inherently flawed and in need of \"fundamental transformation.\" The former group emphasizes the positive aspects of the \"American way of life,\" acknowledging past mistakes, while the latter criticizes the nation's past and present, focusing on its perceived sins.\n\nThis conflict is not about policy disagreements over liberty, equality, and justice, but a deep-seated argument over the interpretation of these principles. The argument over \"first principles\" has been brewing for decades, with the traditional narrative of America being significantly revised in education and popular culture.\n\nMulticulturalist educators, who now dominate the profession, have rewritten the story of America, portraying it as the convergence of three civilizations: the Amerindian native culture, European culture, and the civilization of Islamic West Africa. This narrative, often referred to as the \"three worlds meeting\" or the \"Atlantic World,\" has replaced the traditional narrative of English colonists landing in Jamestown and Plymouth Rock.\n\nSimultaneously, the promotion of diversity and the trinity of race, ethnicity, and gender has dominated education from K-12 to graduate school. The focus has shifted from equality of American citizenship to the racial, ethnic, and gender group to which one belongs.\n\nMeanwhile, \"global education\" has been popular, urging Americans to \"think globally and act locally\" and that \"global problems\" require \"global solutions.\" This narrative, although historically inaccurate and antithetical to responsible American citizenship, served the political purposes of its proponents\u2014the delegitimization of the concept of Western civilization and the deconstruction of the American way of life.\n\nThis new narrative, despite its historical inaccuracies, has slowly and steadily spread to the mainstream media, major corporations, and finally, elected officials and politicians. The conflict between the transmission and transformation of the American regime continues to heat up, with incidents such as the city council of Charlottesville, Virginia, canceling Thomas Jefferson's birthday holiday, Nike recalling the Betsy Ross flag sneakers, and the San Francisco School board covering up a painting of George Washington's life.\n\nAs a means of clarifying the current conflict in contemporary America over transmitting or transforming the American regime, a chart of 36 dueling concepts has been developed, pitting one against the other. This chart, examining the \"regime conflict,\" the \"cold civil war\" or the \"culture war,\" compresses the struggle into a table.\n\nAmericanism is not a dirty word; it's a good thing. We should be proud to say so\u2014and say no to the fundamental transformation of our country. Americanism is not a call to isolationism or xenophobia, but a recognition of the unique history, culture, and principles that define the United States. It is a call to preserve and celebrate the American way of life, while acknowledging and learning from past mistakes, and striving for a more perfect union.",
    " Title: CNN Ferguson Panel Discussion Erupts in Controversy: Mental Health of Young Men of Color in Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on CNN, host Brooke Baldwin moderated a discussion about the recent shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, that quickly escalated into a verbal altercation between University of Pennsylvania professor and CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill and conservative radio host Larry Elder. The conversation, initially focused on the mental health of young men of color, took an unexpected turn as the two guests disagreed on the root cause of the unrest.\n\nThe conversation became heated when Baldwin asked why no one is discussing the mental health of young men of color. Hill responded by stating that he believes the stigma surrounding mental illness, coupled with the assumption that black men are prone to violence and irrationality, contributes to the dismissal of their cries for help as part of their normal everyday pathology.\n\nElder, in response, delivered a speech on the perceived overemphasis on racism in America, stating that the media and the left are training black people to believe that racism is a significant problem, which he argued is used for political gain. He claimed that the Democratic Party relies on the 95% monolithic black vote to survive.\n\nWhen Baldwin asked if Elder was suggesting that racism is not a major problem in the country, he responded emphatically, \"No! No, it is not!\" The conversation became increasingly heated, with both guests raising their voices and interrupting each other.\n\nIn the midst of the heated exchange, Elder expressed frustration, stating, \"Why do you have to insult me all the time? Can't we have a discussion as two black men? Is that possible? Can we try to do that please?\"\n\nThe rest of the interview, while contentious, did see moments of productive discussion, with Elder offering insightful perspectives when he seemed less defensive. The conversation serves as a reminder of the complex and multifaceted issues surrounding race, mental health, and the experiences of young men of color in America.",
    " Title: \"The Fiscal Cliff Deal: A Temporary Reprieve, Not a Solution to Overspending\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 fiscal cliff crisis, a deal was finally passed by the House in a 257-167 vote on January 1, marking a temporary resolution to the impending fiscal cliff. However, this deal, often compared to a \"bungee cord,\" has merely pulled the nation back to the edge of the cliff rather than addressing the root of the problem.\n\nThe focus of the political leaders, including the President, House Speaker, Senate majority and minority leaders, and Mitt Romney, has been misplaced for the past several months. The debate over tax increases for the top 1% or 2% of income earners has dominated the discourse, while the real issue of overspending has been largely ignored.\n\nOverspending, a simple concept that involves spending more than one takes in, has been the underlying cause of the fiscal cliff. The President's tax-the-rich plan, while popular, will not solve the problem. The deficit for fiscal 2013 is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to exceed $1 trillion once again, and the President's tax increases will generate only about $60 billion, or 6% of the annual deficit.\n\nTo close the gap, income tax rates would need to rise to unprecedented levels, requiring a tax increase of more than 65% for all taxpayers. Such a tax increase would not only be economically devastating but also unrealistic, as it would tank the economy and cause incomes and the taxes on them to fall far short of the levels necessary to produce the projected revenue increase.\n\nThe only practical route to reducing the deficit is through rapid economic growth, coupled with real, substantive expenditure cuts. The economy will not grow when a massive tax increase is imposed. Growth requires low taxes, which in turn require smaller government. The nation has forgotten the most basic principles in economics, and until we re-embrace them, we should view short-term fixes as worse than no fix, as they give an illusion of progress that is the polar opposite of their real effect.\n\nThe looming debt-ceiling debate, which is next on the calendar, may be exactly what we need to turn our focus to the real problem of overspending. Bring it on.",

He rejected Trump's claim that only he can cure the nation's ills, stating, \"America is already great. America is already strong, and I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.\"\n\nClinton, who was endorsed by Obama as the most qualified candidate to serve as president, surprised the crowd by joining him on stage at the end of his speech. The two hugged and waved to delegates who were holding up \"thank you\" signs.\n\nKaine, who was nominated as the vice presidential candidate in an overwhelming voice vote earlier in the day, delivered a broadside against Trump in his acceptance speech. He mocked Trump's New York bravado and questioned his qualifications, stating, \"Hillary has a passion for kids and families... Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself.\"\n\nThe night was replete with barbed insults, even as musical acts returned to themes of \"love\" and understanding. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called Trump a \"hateful con man\" and \"egomaniac,\" while former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, an ex-Clinton primary rival, gave a fiery speech calling Trump a \"bully racist.\"\n\nThe sitting vice president, Joe Biden, also went after Trump on all fronts, stating that the billionaire businessman would endanger national security and lacks compassion.\n\nThe focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming, and national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights. Obama delivered his address just weeks after his Justice Department closed the books on its investigation into Clinton's improper use of a private server and email while secretary of state, opting to pursue no charges.\n\nTogether, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party. The president's speech Wednesday effectively kicks off Obama's general election role as a chief Clinton surrogate. The New York Times reported that aides mostly have cleared his calendar for October and expect him to be on the trail regularly for Clinton until the election.",

    " Title: Virginia Governor's Assault Weapons Ban Proposal Fails in State Senate, Gun Control Debate Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A bill aimed at banning the sale of assault weapons in Virginia has failed after members of Governor Ralph Northam's own party balked at the proposal. In a committee vote on Monday, senators voted to shelve the bill for the year and asked the state crime commission to study the issue.\n\nThe outcome drew cheers from a committee room packed with gun advocates. Four moderate Democrats joined Republicans in the vote, rejecting legislation that would have prohibited the sale of certain semiautomatic firearms, including popular AR-15 style rifles, and banned the possession of magazines that hold more than 12 rounds.\n\nThe bill was a top priority for Northam, a Democrat who has campaigned heavily for a broad package of gun control measures. The legislation also engendered the biggest pushback from gun owners and gun-rights advocates, who accused the governor and others of wanting to confiscate commonly owned guns and accessories from law-abiding gun owners. Northam has said repeatedly he does not want to confiscate guns, but argued that banning new sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would help prevent mass murders.\n\nVirginia is currently the epicenter of the country's heated debate over gun control and mass shootings. Tens of thousands of gun-rights activists from across the country flooded the state Capitol and surrounding area in protest, some donning tactical gear and carrying military-style rifles.\n\nNortham has been able to get much of his gun control agenda passed this year, but struggled with the proposed assault weapon ban. Earlier proposals to ban possession of AR-15-style rifles or to require owners to register them with state police have been scrapped. The governor had hoped a watered-down version would win over enough Democratic moderates for passage.\n\nAn estimated 8 million AR-style guns have been sold since they were introduced to the public in the 1960s. The weapons are known for being easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to modify with a variety of scopes, stocks, and rails.\n\nLawmakers in both the House and Senate have already advanced several other gun-control measures and should finalize passage in the coming days. Those bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month, universal background checks on gun purchases, allowing localities to ban guns in public buildings, parks, and other areas, and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others.",

    " Title: The Influence of Ideological Extremism and Personal Factors in Presidential Elections\n\nIn a recent analysis, researchers have found that the impact of ideological extremism on presidential election outcomes has been relatively minor compared to other economic and political factors. The study, which examined the elections of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George McGovern in 1972, suggests that these candidates may have lost by a few percentage points if they had been more moderate. However, their main disadvantage was their challenge to incumbents who presided over election-year economic booms.\n\nConversely, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008, who ran in years marked by economic recessions, benefited from the political appeal of their more moderate opponents being undermined. Both candidates won easily.\n\nIn the current race, Hillary Clinton, despite her \"hard-core liberal\" campaign stands and a voting record to the left of most Senate Democrats, is leading in the polls. Donald Trump, who has moderated some of his party's conservative stands on issues like social spending and gay rights, is trailing. Despite his policy positions being closer to the \"center\" of the electorate than those of previous Republican presidential candidates, many voters have been alienated by Mr. Trump's bombast and political inexperience.\n\nThe study also highlights the significant difference in positions between presidential candidates and swing voters on the issue of racial policy over the past three decades. On average, Republican candidates have been seen as just six points to the right of the political center on the question of government assistance to African-Americans, while Democratic candidates have been 26 points to the left.\n\nThe analysis raises questions about the significance of \"extremism\" in politics. Voters often view their own party's deviations from centrist opinion as virtuous, while quick to condemn the extremism of their political opponents. The study suggests that personal factors such as temperament and experience also play a crucial role in election outcomes. However, it is worth considering whether policy \"extremism\" is inherently negative, or if it represents a necessary divergence from the political center to address pressing issues and represent diverse constituencies.",
    " Title: Opinion Piece: A Personal Perspective on the 2016 Presidential Election: #NeverTrump and #NeverHillary\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump's political stance is now a topic of discussion among all American right-wing officeholders and opinion makers. In this piece, I share my personal stance: I am both #NeverTrump and #NeverHillary.\n\nWhen I was younger, I often voted for third-party candidates, hoping to express my discontent with the two major parties. However, I now believe that abstaining from voting is a more effective way to send a message of disapproval. This November, I will not cast my vote.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, I will feel a mix of relief and sadness. A Clinton presidency would mark the end of a divided era on the Supreme Court and the consolidation of liberal gains in the judiciary. This would likely result in the reversal of incremental pro-life gains on the state level and more battles over religious liberty, gradually hampering the ability of my co-religionists to run their colleges, schools, and businesses according to their consciences.\n\nClinton's foreign policy decisions, shaped by the fear of Democrats losing elections for not being \"tough\" enough, are likely to lead to disasters similar to her Libyan intervention or the intervention in Kosovo. Both interventions, launched in the name of human rights, ultimately empowered Islamist extremists.\n\nA Clinton presidency would bring known demerits, but I can anticipate them. They are intensifications of the political frustrations I already have. Trump's victory, on the other hand, would be something else altogether.\n\nTrump's victory would signify the defeat of nearly every certainty in America's political culture, which, in theory, I should welcome. However, Trump's foreign policy judgment is questionable, and his nationalist views on immigration and trade are often perceived as simplistic or even misguided.\n\nTrump's shamelessness, ignorance, touchy ego, and complete freedom from political norms make him a dangerous candidate, both within the Republican party and as a potential president. Without the constraints of party orthodoxy and personal shame, we would be electing a man with a hyper-sensitive personality and little working knowledge of government to lead the most important nation on Earth.\n\nI am still a conservative who believes in electing people of good character to high offices. However, the most significant reason I will be nervous if Trump wins is this: His victory would invite foreign rivals to challenge the United States, and I do not want the man who goes to DEFCON 1 on TV to be the person who actually gets to command our armed forces to go to DEFCON 1.",
    " Title: Political Tensions Rise as Trump Prepares to Nominate Supreme Court Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nA political battle is brewing over the replacement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement from the US top court on Wednesday. Mr. Kennedy, 81, retires on July 31, giving President Donald Trump a chance to cement a conservative majority on the high court for decades to come.\n\nDemocrats argue that the Republican-controlled Congress should wait until after mid-term elections to confirm a successor. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has already cancelled a scheduled recess for the upper chamber in August, suggested that Mr. Kennedy's replacement would be confirmed before November's mid-term elections.\n\n\"The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this vacancy,\" he said on Wednesday. His comments came after President Trump said the process to find a replacement would \"begin immediately.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy made the announcement earlier on Wednesday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after 30 years on the top court. Although he was a conservative justice, Mr. Kennedy sided with liberals on certain key votes, including abortion and gay marriage.\n\nThe Senate, which votes to confirm Mr. Trump's nominee, is currently controlled by Republicans with a slim 51-seat majority. However, that could change after mid-term elections in November.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump warned his supporters that Democrats would \"rewrite the Constitution any way they want\" unless Republicans could quickly confirm a conservative justice. \"We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,\" he said of Mr. Kennedy's successor.\n\nThe president has promised to draw names from the same list of 25 conservative candidates from which he picked Justice Neil Gorsuch in February last year. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if he would wait until after the mid-term elections to nominate a successor, Mr. Trump said: \"I think you want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe long-simmering tensions over Supreme Court picks became a political flashpoint in 2016 when the Republicans successfully blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the late Justice Anthony Scalia. At the time, Republicans said it was unfair to confirm a judge during an election year. Democrats are now pointing to that argument in an effort to halt the confirmation of Justice Kennedy's replacement.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer, in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate, called for delaying a confirmation vote until after the mid-terms, adding that \"anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy\" from Republicans.\n\nThe Supreme Court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. Rather than serving fixed terms, the justices serve for life unless they decide to retire. This makes their appointments particularly significant.\n\nThis week, the court upheld Mr. Trump's travel ban, which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Earlier this month, it ruled in favor of a baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.\n\n\"Hopefully, we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House shortly after Justice Kennedy's retirement was announced. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Twitter that the president would nominate \"a strong conservative, in the tradition of the late Justice Scalia\" who would uphold the \"God-given liberties\" of the constitution.\n\nMr. Kennedy, who is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court, earned a reputation as a swing vote conservative who supported liberal arguments on key decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. As a result, news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat.\n\nMr. Trump, during his presidential campaign, vowed to attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion throughout the US. \"If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen,\" Mr. Trump said during an October 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights, and gun rights. Mr. Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision in 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: \"They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right.\"\n\nAs a justice, he routinely favored personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr. Trump said Mr. Kennedy had \"displayed great vision\" and \"tremendous heart.\" The White House also released a statement thanking Mr. Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a \"tireless voice for individual rights.\"\n\nFrom the list of 25 judges that Mr. Trump has said he would draw from, US media report several front-runners. Most candidates are appointees of President George W. Bush, and only one of the supposed top-picks is a woman. Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is a Washington, DC appeals court judge and was a former clerk to Mr. Kennedy. He represented Mr. Bush during the Florida vote recount in 2000 that won Mr. Bush the presidential election. However, the American Bar Association recently downgraded his qualifications based on a lack of experience and concerns over partisan bias. Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Mr. McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are other likely nominees.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Lifts Ban on Military Equipment Transfer to Local Police Departments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that it will lift the ban on the transfer of surplus military equipment to state and local police departments, a move that was initially put in place by the Obama administration in 2015. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking at a press conference, stated, \"It carries real weight to speak against the President while in office, but I believe this decision will be beneficial for public safety.\"\n\nPresident Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Monday, reinstating the Pentagon's 1033 program, which was halted by the Obama administration after images of heavily armed police responding to protests in Ferguson, Missouri, shocked the nation. The ban blocked the transfer of armored vehicles, grenade launchers, armed aircraft, bayonets, and guns and ammunition of.50 caliber or higher.\n\nSessions argued that the restrictions imposed by the Obama administration went too far and that public safety should not be compromised by \"superficial concerns.\" He cited the ongoing rescue efforts in Houston, Texas, as an example of the need for such equipment.\n\nThe ban was part of the previous administration's efforts to re-establish trust between law enforcement and the communities they police, following a string of police-related deaths of black men in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, South Carolina, and elsewhere. At the time, Obama warned that such equipment cast the police in the role of an \"occupying force,\" deepening divisions with distrustful communities.\n\nTrump has positioned himself as a \"law and order\" president who will restore an American way of life that the administration has warned is beset by worsening violence, including rising levels of violence against law enforcement. Sessions promised the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) on Monday that the order will \"make it easier to protect yourselves and your communities.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as the role and conduct of police, particularly where it intersects with issues of race, continues to captivate national interest and spark fierce debate. Critics have accused state police officers in Charlottesville, Virginia, of standing by idly while a white nationalist fired into a crowd during violent clashes between demonstrators earlier this month.\n\nCongress established the 1033 program almost three decades ago as part of the annual defense authorization bill as part of an effort to help local law enforcement pursue drug investigations. However, in 1997, the program was expanded to include all local law enforcement operations, including counterterrorism. More than $5 billion of military equipment has been transferred to police departments since then.\n\nSome law enforcement groups, including the FOP, have been pushing for the rollback of the Obama-era ban. Supporters of the program argue that the equipment was protective and defensive, and in addition to saving lives and reducing crime rates, saved money by repurposing equipment for which taxpayers had already paid. Sessions argued Monday that the program also provided first responder and rescue equipment \"like what they're using in Texas right now.\"\n\nCritics, meanwhile, argue that the program allowed police departments to stockpile military-grade equipment and increased the instances of violent encounters. Almost 150 law enforcement agencies were suspended over the six-year period prior to the ban for losing track of equipment, according to ABC News and Fusion.",
    " Title: Facebook Reduces Distribution, Adds Disclaimer to Altered Pelosi Video Amid Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has issued a statement regarding the controversial altered video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that went viral, which appeared to show her slurring her words. The social media giant has not removed the video but has reduced its distribution and added a disclaimer stating that the video is \"false.\"\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Facebook explained that it removes content that violates its Community Standards but does not have a policy requiring that information posted on the platform be true. The company clarified that it does not distribute all content but allows some as forms of expression.\n\n\"There's a tension here; we work hard to find the right balance between encouraging free expression and promoting a safe and authentic community,\" the statement read. \"We believe that reducing the distribution of inauthentic content strikes that balance.\"\n\nFacebook also outlined its approach to combating misleading content. It removes content that violates its Community Standards, such as fake accounts, reduces the distribution of content that does not directly violate Community Standards but still undermines the authenticity of the platform, and empowers users to decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share by informing them with more context in-product and promoting news literacy.\n\nThe controversy arose amid growing scrutiny of Facebook and other social media companies regarding their handling of content on their platforms. Facebook and Twitter have faced criticism for apparent bias against conservatives and for allowing content promoted by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nMonika Bickert, Facebook's vice president for product policy and counterterrorism, explained on CNN that the company had \"dramatically\" reduced the video's distribution and informed users that the video was false. CNN's Anderson Cooper pressed Bickert on why the video was not removed entirely.\n\nBickert responded, \"We think it's important for people to make their own informed choice about what to believe. Our job is to make sure that we are getting them accurate information and that's why we work with more than 50 fact-checking organizations around the world.\"\n\nShe added that the company would remove misinformation related to ongoing riots or some kind of threat to physical violence. The controversy continues to spark debate about the role of social media companies in policing content and the balance between free speech and misinformation.",
    " Title: Millennials Embrace School Choice: A New Era for Education in America\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing trend of support for school choice among Millennials, as revealed by two separate national surveys, indicates a potential shift in the education landscape in the United States. According to a survey by Beck Research in January, 75 percent of Millennials support school choice, a figure that is nearly identical to the results of a poll released yesterday by GenForward.\n\nThe GenForward poll shows strong support for vouchers for low-income students across racial and ethnic lines. The poll found that 79 percent of African Americans, 76 percent of Asian Americans, 77 percent of Latinos, and 66 percent of whites support the concept. Charter schools also enjoy support from 65 percent of African Americans, 61 percent of Asian Americans, 58 percent of Latinos, and 55 percent of whites.\n\nThis growing support for school choice could be a winning issue for both Republicans and Democrats who are willing to seize the moment and push for bold reforms. In a Gallup poll from April, federal funding for school vouchers was one of only four policy proposals that both parties supported on balance.\n\nThe momentum for educational choice has grown in recent years, with states like Florida, Nevada, Louisiana, North Carolina, Illinois, Arizona, and Wisconsin enacting or expanding educational choice for K-12 students. On the national level, efforts are underway to create an education tax credit that would enable more children to access the school of their parents' choice. Federal school-choice initiatives are already available in higher education, in the form of grants and loans that a student may use at any eligible college.\n\nThe support for school choice is not just a political issue; it is a reflection of the values and beliefs of the Millennial generation. With 26 states having private-school-choice programs and 44 states having charter schools, the nationwide support for educational choice is clear. The research also shows that school choice works. Eleven of the 17 empirical studies using the random-assignment method show that students using private-school-choice programs do better academically. Charter-school research from Stanford's Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) shows significantly improved academic results, especially for students in urban charter schools.\n\nMillennials, who grew up with abundant options across most aspects of their lives, are naturally inclined to think expansively when it comes to education. They distrust institutions and are skeptical of a monolithic K-12 system that has not been truly reformed in generations and produces meager results on international tests. The future of education in America could be bright and dynamic, with better outcomes for our students. All we\u2014and our leaders\u2014have to do is choose that future.\n\nTommy Schultz, the national communications director for the American Federation for Children, the nation's largest educational-choice advocacy organization, emphasizes the importance of educational choice for the Millennial generation. \"We don't believe that your five-digit ZIP code should determine whether you go to the good school, the bad school, the best school, or the failing school,\" Schultz said. \"With the growing popularity of online and personalized learning that can give you front-row access to some of the best teachers and best courses on the planet, Millennials are naturally inclined to think even more expansively when it comes to what's possible in education.\"",
    " Title: Study Reveals Liberal-Conservative Friendship Strain: Pew Research Shows Divergence in Political Views Affects Relationships\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Pew Research Center study has revealed a significant divide in friendships between liberals and conservatives, with nearly half of liberal Democrats stating that a friend's support for Donald Trump would strain their relationship, compared to only 13 percent of Republicans who feel the same about a friend supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed over 10,000 U.S. adults, shows that 47 percent of liberal Democrats say a friend's support for Trump would put a strain on their friendship, while among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters more broadly, the number is 35 percent. White and more-educated Democrats are more likely to find it challenging to be friends with a Trump supporter.\n\nIn contrast, only 13 percent of Republicans say a friend's support of Clinton would strain their relationship. The imbalance is likely due to the fact that liberals tend to live in more homogeneous areas and do not associate with conservatives. Another Pew study from last year showed that 47 percent of people who planned to vote for Clinton did not have any close friends who were Trump supporters, while 31 percent of Trump supporters said they did not have any friends who backed Clinton.\n\nThe study also found that 68 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they find it \"stressful and frustrating\" to talk to people who have a different opinion of Trump, compared to 52 percent of Republican and GOP-leaning voters.\n\nThe findings of the study have sparked debate and discussion on social media, with some arguing that the divide in political views is causing a rift in friendships and relationships. However, others argue that the study highlights the importance of open dialogue and the need for people to engage in discussions with those who hold different political views.\n\nRegardless of one's political leanings, it is clear that the divide in political views is affecting relationships and conversations in America. As the study shows, it is essential to remember that open dialogue and understanding are crucial for building bridges and fostering a more inclusive and tolerant society.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Corrects Job Creation Claim for African-Americans During Obama and Trump Administrations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare admission of error, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a correction and apology on Tuesday for providing false information during a press briefing regarding job creation for African-Americans during the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nSanders had incorrectly stated that President Donald Trump had created three times as many jobs for African-Americans as former President Barack Obama during his entire eight years in the White House. In a tweet, Sanders acknowledged the mistake, stating, \"Correction from today\u2019s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn\u2019t.\"\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when Obama was president, he created nearly 3 million jobs for blacks, about 15 times what Sanders initially claimed. Sanders had been attempting to highlight Trump's record with the African-American population, arguing that not only was it great, but it was even better than Obama's, as Trump tripled Obama's job creation record for the black community.\n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing, Sanders stated, \"This President, since he took office, in the year and a half that he's been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans.\" She continued, \"That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this President took office. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans.\"\n\nThe error was made during Sanders' defense of Trump on race, following accusations that the president used the N-word on tape and called former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman a \"dog\" on Twitter. The White House Council of Economic Advisers also issued an apology on Twitter, stating there was a miscommunication to Sanders.",
    " Title: New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez Faces Fresh Allegations of Potential Conflict of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nA fresh wave of allegations has surfaced against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), with an Associated Press (AP) investigation revealing that the embattled New Jersey Democrat sponsored legislation that could have benefited a major donor's investment in a natural gas vehicle conversion company.\n\nThe AP report, published on Monday, details that Senator Menendez sponsored a bill to provide tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to natural gas. The bill, if passed, could have potentially aided Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor and investor in Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp., a company whose board Melgen sits on.\n\nThe bill sponsorship is seen as another instance of potential convergence of interests between the senator and a significant donor. However, political analysts in New Jersey argue that this bill sponsorship is part of a larger clean-energy agenda from the senator, who has a history of supporting environmental causes.\n\nBrigid Harrison, a political scientist at Montclair State University, suggests that the bill sponsorship is unlikely to represent a conflict of interest for Menendez. \"I'm still not convinced... that this kind of behavior reaches to the status where it becomes enormously problematic in voters' minds,\" says Professor Harrison. \"I'm not seeing any illegality or conflict of interest here.\"\n\nThe bill-sponsorship revelation rekindles the larger issue of Sen. Menendez's relationship with Melgen, with recent reports suggesting that Menendez provided political favors for Melgen in exchange for campaign support. Menendez's use of Melgen's private jet for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic in 2010, which were not reimbursed until three years later, is one such example.\n\nMenendez also intervened in a Medicare billing dispute between Melgen and federal authorities, as well as a port security contract, allegedly to protect the interests of his friend and donor, according to news reports. The allegations are compounded by a $700,000 donation Melgen made to Majority PAC, a \"super political-action committee\" created to elect Senate Democrats, which ultimately made a $582,500 contribution to Menendez's 2012 reelection campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nMenendez has denied all allegations of impropriety, including any allegations of conflict-of-interest stemming from this latest report. His office did not respond to calls regarding his sponsorship of the natural gas bill.\n\nThe AP report states that Menendez joined Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) as key backers of the natural gas bill. Soon after, Melgen joined the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp., which manufactures technology to convert diesel- and gas-fuel vehicles to natural gas. Though Melgen's investment in the company is confidential under US Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company required a minimum investment of $51,500, according to the AP.\n\nUltimately, the bill did not receive enough votes to pass in the Senate. However, while it was under consideration, a consultant for Gaseous Fuel Systems spent $220,000 lobbying Menendez and other congressional officials, according to interviews and Senate records as reported by the AP.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen,\" the AP said in its report. \"Instead, the connection between the two men's interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator... and his millionaire backer.\"\n\nAnalysts argue that evidence of \"close symmetry\" in this latest development is not enough to topple Menendez. Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, suggests that Menendez's involvement in clean-energy technology is more of a coincidence than anything more sinister.\n\nMenendez has a history of supporting clean-energy initiatives, including co-sponsoring legislation aimed at jump-starting offshore wind energy, extending solar energy tax credits, and creating block grants to spur green-energy projects. Menendez recently reintroduced the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act and Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, legislation he originally introduced in the 112th Congress to end tax subsidies for the \"Big 5\" oil companies.\n\n\"It isn't that this came out of the blue, it's part of a larger cohesive agenda... to deal with energy issues the country is facing,\" says Harrison of Montclair State University. \"His record is an accurate reflection of his policy concerns, and this is one part of that.\"\n\nMenendez is not alone in supporting the natural gas bill or in sharing a passion for similar causes. In fact, the House version of the natural gas legislation had 181 co-sponsors. The natural gas industry spends hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying members of Congress, including Menendez and his staff.\n\nMenendez's ethics controversy has had an impact on his poll numbers, and this latest development may further damage the senator's image. A Quinnipiac University poll found Menendez's approval ratings plummeted 15 percentage points between January and February, as news reports emerged about his relationship with Melgen. His approval rating dropped from 51 percent in mid-January to 36 percent in mid-February. The same poll found only 28 percent of New Jersey voters said the senator was \"honest and trustworthy.\"\n\n\"I don't think these microbial issues that deal with campaign finance and sponsorship of legislation are enough to make a difference in most voter's minds in this state,\" says Harrison.",
    " Title: Obama Administration to Implement 100% Income Verification for Health Care Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is set to implement new procedures that will enable the government to verify the income of Americans who apply for government subsidies under the federal health care law. Gary Cohen, deputy director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, made this announcement during a hearing with the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.\n\nCohen assured the committee that the government will verify the income of all applicants for subsidies on state-based exchanges, where individuals without employer-based insurance can shop for private health coverage with the help of premium tax credits. Daniel Werfel, acting director of the IRS, added that the tax credits will be delivered through the health exchanges, not directly to the individual enrollees.\n\nChairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, expressed concerns that enrollees in state health exchanges would self-certify their income, with the administration cross-checking that information much later, when the enrollees file their tax returns. In his opening remarks, Camp highlighted the increasing uncertainty and confusion surrounding the Affordable Care Act, with roughly 60 days remaining until state-based insurance markets begin enrollment for coverage that takes effect in January.\n\nCamp also cited government accountability reports suggesting that the federal government is lagging in its efforts to set up exchanges in more than half the states, and the White House's decision to delay the employer mandate by one year, to 2015. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reportedly told the committee that the Obama administration was on track to meet the October 1 deadline for the new health care law, but Camp stated that \"over the past two months, the evidence shows just the opposite is true.\"\n\nIn response to the mounting distrust of the IRS in the wake of a political targeting scandal in its tax-exempt organizations branch, the House is scheduled to vote on a bill on Friday that would prevent the IRS from implementing and enforcing the health care law. Werfel assured the committee that at no time will tax data be displayed to anyone outside of the marketplace itself.\n\nMichigan Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, stated that the hearing had been convened \"under the pretense that House Republicans are interested in learning about the implementation of the landmark law.\" Levin added that the Republican mission is \"clear: don't implement, destroy.\" He also questioned why Republicans have leaned on outside organizations, including the National Football League, to discourage them from helping to educate Americans about current health insurance opportunities and assistance that will be available through the marketplaces.",
    " Title: Democratic Senators Express Concerns Over Obamacare Implementation and Premium Increases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private meeting with White House officials, Democratic senators have expressed concerns about the implementation and rollout of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The concerns come as some members of the party are growing nervous about potential political repercussions if the law's implementation is messy or if premiums increase significantly.\n\nAt the caucus meeting, Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election next year, voiced concerns about small businesses in New Hampshire not knowing how to comply with the law and about restaurants trying to reduce workers' hours to avoid the law's requirement to offer health coverage to full-time employees.\n\nSenator Tom Harkin (D-IA), chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on health care, expressed his frustration with President Obama's decision to take money from public health prevention programs to publicize the new law.\n\nSenator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-MD) also expressed concerns about big rate increases being sought by the largest health insurer in his state, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. The company has sought increases averaging 25 percent for individual insurance policies that will be sold in the state insurance exchange, and it is seeking increases of about 15 percent for small businesses.\n\nThe concerns come as Obamacare remains unpopular, and Democrats are grappling with growing fears that a 2010-style backlash may befall them in 2014, when the law's more problematic elements are set to roll out. The law's implementation has been described as a \"train wreck\" and a \"third world experience\" by its chief author and administrator, respectively.\n\nRecent reports suggest that Obamacare fires are flaring up all over, with Politico describing the situation as such, and Fox's Chris Stirewalt highlighting a problematic and impending Medicaid assessment deadline the administration is poised to miss. The concerns and issues with the implementation of Obamacare continue to mount, and the political fallout for Democrats could be significant if the law's problems are not addressed.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Ends 2018 with Solid Growth, but Forecasts Point to Slower Growth in 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy concluded 2018 with a robust performance, marking its best showing since the Great Recession of 2007-09. However, economists predict a potential slowdown in growth for 2019.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6 percent in the October-December period. This follows an average 3.7 percent advance in the previous two quarters, marking the economy's best six-month stretch since 2014. Economists had anticipated a 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the year, the economy grew 2.9 percent, matching its performance since 2015, a post-recession high. Economist Leslie Preston of TD Economics noted, \"The U.S. economy had more momentum at the end of 2018 than anticipated.\"\n\nHowever, federal tax cuts and spending increases that boosted growth in 2018 are expected to wane later this year. This, combined with a sluggish global economy and ongoing U.S. trade tensions with China, are likely to result in slower U.S. growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in 2019, economists predict. Many analysts foresee a recession by 2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded to this wary outlook by retreating from its plan to raise interest rates twice this year to combat inflation. Instead, Fed policymakers have adopted a wait-and-see approach and indicated that a rate cut to stimulate growth may be as likely as a hike.\n\nThe labor market is also expected to lose some steam as the 4 percent unemployment rate makes it harder for businesses to find qualified workers. President Trump has promised at least 3 percent growth over the longer term, but most economists consider this an unrealistic expectation due to an aging population and tepid growth in productivity.\n\nConsumer spending, which grew a sturdy 2.8 percent, decreased from 3.5 percent in the third quarter. The showing was dampened by a surprising 1.2 percent retail sales decline in December, which some economists question and expect to be revised higher.\n\nAmericans have benefited from both the tax cuts and lower gasoline prices. Consumer confidence, which can foreshadow spending, fell late last year due to a big stock sell-off, but it has rebounded strongly recently due to the stock market's rally and the resolution of the 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIncomes also have been rising. Employers added an average 223,000 jobs a month last year, up from 182,000 in 2017. And by the second half of the year, annual wage growth topped 3 percent for the first time in nine years as firms bid up to attract workers.\n\nBusiness investment increased 6.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent in the third quarter, largely due to a big jump in software and research and development. Equipment spending also rose 6.7 percent. The solid performance defied the drop in stock prices late last year that rattled business confidence, slowing global growth, and President Trump's trade standoff with China.\n\nBusiness stockpiling, which is volatile, added 0.13 percentage points to growth. Government spending edged up 0.4 percent after rising 2.6 percent in the second quarter. Federal spending increased 1.6 percent, bolstered by a 6.9 percent jump in defense outlays, while state and local government spending fell 0.3 percent.\n\nThe budget deal Congress passed early last year is boosting government outlays, though the effects are likely to fade by the second half of 2019. The nation's trade deficit widened as exports increased 1.6 percent while imports grew 2.7 percent. As a result, trade overall was a slight drag on economic growth. China has imposed tariffs on U.S. imports such as soybeans in retaliation for broad U.S. tariffs on Chinese shipments. Trump recently delayed plans to increase a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent, raising hopes for a resolution to the impasse.\n\nResidential investment fell for the fourth straight month, slipping 3.5 percent. While low housing supplies reflect a need for more construction, builders have faced severe worker shortages and higher material costs that have slowed projects. Also, existing home sales slowed noticeably late last year due to higher mortgage rates and home prices, leading many builders to pull back. Both prices and rates have moderated recently, possibly heralding a recovery in housing starts.",
    " Title: Bannon Predicts Government Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, former White House strategist Steve Bannon predicted a potential government shutdown before the midterm elections due to President Trump's insistence on funding for his long-promised border wall. Bannon stated, \"I believe the government will actually shut down in the run-up to the election.\"\n\nThe wall, according to Bannon, is \"central to [Trump's] program.\" Despite Trump's claims that the wall is already under construction, Congress has yet to allocate funding for it. To date, only existing fences have been repaired, and several prototypes of a potential wall have been built.\n\nIn January, CNN reported that the Trump administration had requested $33 billion to cover the costs of securing the border, with $18 billion allocated for the wall, according to Customs and Border Protection documents obtained by CNN and sent to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In March, Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that did not include any funds for the wall.\n\nBannon suggested that Trump may resort to using funds from the military budget if Congress refuses to appropriate the necessary funds. He stated, \"I believe that what he's going to do is, as we come up on September 30, if that appropriations bill does not include spending to fully build his wall\u2014not some $1.6 billion for prototypes, I mean to build the southern wall\u2014I believe he will shut down the government.\"\n\nBannon's comments were made in an interview that will be rebroadcast on Sunday's Fareed Zakaria GPS.\n\nTrump's demand for a wall was a key component of his 2016 presidential campaign. In his Trump Tower announcement of a White House bid, Trump emphasized the wall issue, stating, \"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\"\n\nTrump's insistence on Mexico paying for the wall led to the cancellation of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's planned visit to Washington in early 2017. Last week, Trump reiterated his demand for Mexico to pay for the wall during a rally in Nashville, prompting a quick response from the Mexican president: \"NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever.\"\n\nBannon was fired from his White House post as chief strategist last year following his candid remarks to author Michael Wolf for the book Fire and Fury.",
    " Title: US Deploys Additional Military Resources to Middle East Amidst Escalating Tensions with Iran\n\nThe United States is bolstering its military presence in the Middle East with the deployment of a Patriot missile-defense system and the arrival of the USS Arlington, an amphibious warship, in the Gulf. The USS Abraham Lincoln strike group, which includes aircraft and amphibious vehicles, will also join the US forces in the region.\n\nThe Pentagon has stated that these moves are a response to a potential threat to US forces in the region from Iran, without providing specific details. Iran, in turn, has dismissed the US's claims as baseless and described the deployments as \"psychological warfare.\"\n\nThe US currently has approximately 5,200 troops stationed in neighboring Iraq. The Patriot system is designed to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft. The USS Arlington's deployment was reportedly already scheduled, but its arrival was expedited to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, according to US Central Command. Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile.\"\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and several other nations. Under the agreement, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and allow international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. In response to the US's re-imposed economic sanctions, Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping route.\n\nThe Trump administration aims to negotiate a new deal that would cover not only Iran's nuclear activities but also its ballistic missile program and \"malign behavior\" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against the US measures, including the designation of its elite Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe US has ended exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. The sanctions have led to a significant downturn in Iran's economy, causing the value of its currency to plummet, driving away foreign investors, and sparking protests.\n\nThe future of the Iran nuclear deal remains uncertain, with no guarantee of success in the upcoming diplomatic negotiations. The Trump administration's ultimate goal is the collapse of the nuclear deal, but the risk of conflict, although unintentional, is growing.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at the Tense Relationship Between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been marked by tension and disagreement, a dynamic that stems more from their differing political ideologies than personal incompatibilities, according to Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nGiven their contrasting political leanings, friction between the liberal Democrat and the conservative Likud leader was inevitable. However, the relationship was exacerbated by a series of choices made by both leaders.\n\nCritics suggest that Mr. Obama was not always attuned to the sensitivities of the U.S.-Israel alliance. Known for cool relations with foreign leaders, Mr. Obama found it difficult to understand Mr. Netanyahu's distrust, and made certain decisions more challenging by not preparing the Israeli leader for his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Netanyahu often chose the most incendiary interpretations of Mr. Obama's policies, preferring to express outrage rather than emphasizing common ground, according to his own advisers. His suspicions were fueled by visits from Republican lawmakers and conservative patrons, such as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had their own grievances against the president.\n\nWhen they do communicate, their conversations are robust and pointed. Mr. Netanyahu is direct and, at times, blunt, while Mr. Obama is more reserved but can come across as condescending. A phone call between them can last up to 90 minutes. \"They like debating each other, to an extent,\" said Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser.\n\nThe two leaders first met in 2007, in a hastily arranged chat at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, in a janitor's office. Mr. Netanyahu, then in the opposition, was returning home, while Mr. Obama, running for president, was coming from the campaign trail. Despite the unconventional setting, they reportedly had chemistry, according to Mr. Rhodes.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Address LGBTQ Issues, Vow to Promote Rights Abroad and at Home\n\nIn a televised townhall event in Los Angeles, California, former Vice President Joe Biden and seven other Democratic presidential candidates discussed their positions on LGBTQ issues, with Biden pledging to withhold foreign aid from countries that persecute LGBTQ individuals and establish an office in the State Department to promote LGBTQ rights worldwide.\n\nThe event, the second major presidential forum dedicated to LGBTQ issues during the Democratic nominating campaign, followed an event in Iowa last month that drew 10 of the 19 candidates vying to take on President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nBiden, the front-runner in the Democratic race, struggled to articulate his positions during the previous forum, particularly his vote as a U.S. senator for a military funding bill that included the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that banned harassment of closeted gay soldiers but barred those who were out from military service. Biden later backed repeal of that policy and, while he voted for a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman, he backed same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is vying to become the first openly gay U.S. president, spoke about his experience as a gay man, recounting serving in the military in Afghanistan while he was still closeted and realizing he might die without being able to know what it was like to fall in love and marry. Buttigieg also addressed public health rules that bar gay men from giving blood dating from the HIV epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, stating that the policy is based on prejudice rather than science.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker opened the forum, stressing inclusion and acceptance. Senator Bernie Sanders, a top Democratic contender, missed the event while he recovers from a heart attack. Gay rights advocates have expressed dismay at the Trump administration's record on LGBTQ issues, including a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.\n\nAhead of the forum, Buttigieg, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris released plans to secure equality for LGBTQ people. All three support the Equality Act, which would explicitly add LGBTQ protections to federal anti-discrimination law. They also vowed to make pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that helps lower the risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, accessible and affordable to all who want it. Buttigieg said he would eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, in part by restoring the White House Office of National AIDS Policy that has gone dormant under Trump.\n\nAll three candidates promised to elevate LGBTQ concerns as president. Warren said she would appoint a special envoy at the State Department, while Harris said she would create a White House position, chief advocate for LGBTQ+ Affairs, to coordinate efforts across the entire federal government. Warren, who has risen steadily in the polls to challenge Biden as the frontrunner, drew the biggest applause of the night as she addressed issues most of the candidates agreed on in a down-to-earth way.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Faces Calls for Transparency as Alabama Execution Case Remains Sealed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare move, the Supreme Court allowed the state of Alabama to seal documents and records in the case of convicted murderer Christopher Price's execution, which took place last week. The unusual move has sparked concerns over transparency and the public's right to know, leading to a motion by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and NPR to unseal the material that was blocked from public view.\n\nThe sealed information does not pertain to Price's guilt but rather to the drugs and execution protocol used by Alabama. Price had requested to be executed by nitrogen gas, arguing it would be less painful than the drug midazolam, which Alabama ultimately used.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to seal the information comes amidst ongoing debates about the death penalty, but the court's disputes are usually not hidden from the public. In this case, all deletions were at the insistence of Alabama, with no explanation provided for the need for secrecy.\n\nThe Reporters Committee noted that even in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971, when the government claimed a national security interest in barring publication, the briefs were unredacted, available to the press and public, and oral arguments were conducted publicly, with only parts of the court appendix sealed.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, in 2018, called the judiciary \"the most transparent branch in government.\" The Supreme Court has long upheld the right of access to a wide range of judicial proceedings and records, as it enhances the quality and safeguards the integrity of the fact-finding process and allows the public to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process.\n\nDefense lawyer Aaron Katz agreed to let the record be closed to the public and press in the lower courts due to time constraints, with the execution date set for May 30. Katz stated that in such circumstances, one cannot afford any \"sideshow\" and must agree to whatever terms the state imposes to get the information needed to prove one's case.\n\nThe Reporters Committee is now asking the Supreme Court to unseal the briefs filed in the Supreme Court. Katie Townsend, legal director for the reporters committee, stated that if the secrecy order were to stand, it would prevent other lawyers from finding out what the legal arguments or evidence were in this case.\n\nMike Lewis, a spokesman for the Alabama attorney general, stated that the state sought to keep the records and arguments secret \"out of concern for the safety of correctional officers as well as inmates.\" However, defense lawyer Aaron Katz has never sought to disclose the names of corrections officers or anyone else involved in the execution.\n\nThe Reporters Committee points to the availability of appellate records that extend \"far back in the nation's history,\" and it points to a more recent opinion issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. That decision declared that \"the public can not have confidence that the nation's appellate courts issue well-reasoned and fair opinions derived from facts and legal arguments the parties present if the case proceeds with key argument and evidence under seal.\" The circuit court opinion was written by President Barack Obama's failed Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, and joined by his then-colleague Brett Kavanaugh, later appointed to the Supreme Court by President Trump.",
    " Title: Abortion Restrictions and Midterm Elections: A Divisive Issue Shaping the 2018 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, the issue of abortion has emerged as a significant factor in shaping the political landscape, with both parties viewing it as a potential game-changer. President Donald Trump's recent actions restricting abortion, such as the proposed ban on federal funding for organizations that refer for abortions or share locations with abortion providers, have been met with mixed reactions.\n\nWhile Republicans, including Trump, view these actions as a means to galvanize their conservative base, Democrats argue that such moves will hurt, not help, their candidates in November. The issue has become a litmus test for public opinion, potentially shaping the messaging of both parties heading into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAlexandra De Luca, press secretary for EMILY's List, a group that supports pro-abortion rights women running for office, stated, \"This is just going to encourage women across the country\u2014not just Democrats, but Republicans and independents\u2014to come out and support pro-choice candidates who are going to stand up to these unconstitutional attacks on our health care.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, referred to the Title X announcement as a sign of desperation from the Trump administration. \"They're seeing flat numbers, while ours are climbing all over the country. They know their only option is to throw red meat at their base,\" Hogue said.\n\nThe stakes are high for both sides. Anti-abortion advocates aim to elect more Republicans to pass a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, defund Planned Parenthood, and approve future Supreme Court nominees. Democrats, on the other hand, seek to gain control of both chambers to block such bills and fight back against policy changes from the administration.\n\nTrump's actions on abortion have been a significant part of his presidency, with the banning of tax dollars for foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortions, broadened exemptions for employers with moral or religious objections to providing birth control, and the rescinding of Obama-era guidance that sought to protect Planned Parenthood from state defunding efforts.\n\nThe issue has sparked significant campaign spending, with Planned Parenthood announcing a $20 million campaign targeting eight states, the largest such effort it's ever undertaken. The anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List isn't just trying to match that, but surpass it, with a goal of raising and spending $25 million. NARAL this week announced its largest-ever midterm investment of $5 million in 19 states.\n\nThe debate over abortion rights is likely to continue to shape the political landscape in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections and beyond.",
    " Title: Trump Expresses Willingness to Engage North Korea, Criticizes Paris Climate Accord, and Plans to Dismantle Dodd-Frank\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expressed his willingness to engage with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's nuclear program. This potential dialogue would represent a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the secluded nation.\n\nTrump also criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in eastern Ukraine, called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, and expressed intentions to dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if elected president.\n\nRegarding North Korea, Trump stated, \"I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him.\" He also emphasized the economic leverage the United States holds over China, stating, \"At the same time, I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China.\"\n\nThe Paris climate accord, which commits over 170 countries to reducing carbon emissions, has been criticized by Trump, who believes the U.S. is unfairly treated. He expressed a desire to renegotiate the pact, which would mark a significant setback for the first truly global climate accord.\n\nTurning to the economy, Trump plans to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks. He stated that the platform would dismantle nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms implemented after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Trump described Dodd-Frank as a \"very negative force\" with a \"very bad name.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump perceives a financial bubble within the tech startup industry, stating that tech companies are attaining high valuations without ever making a profit.\n\nRegarding the U.S. Federal Reserve, Trump expressed a preference for a Republican to head the institution, but stated he is \"not an enemy\" of current chair Janet Yellen. He praised Yellen's performance, stating, \"I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point.\" He added that inflation \"doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon.\"",
    " Title: Jeff Bezos and the Minimum Wage Debate: A Closer Look at Amazon's Minimum Wage Policy and Its Impact on the Workforce\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, has found himself at the center of a heated debate over minimum wage and its implications on the workforce. The Amazon founder, known for his groundbreaking e-commerce platform, has been criticized by some for his company's employment practices, particularly regarding the eligibility of some Amazon workers for food stamps.\n\nInitially, Amazon responded to these criticisms, labeling them as \"inaccurate\" and \"misleading.\" The company argued that it was not responsible for the circumstances of its workers, and that by creating jobs, it was providing workers with better opportunities. However, the anti-capitalist media portrayed Amazon as a \"sweatshop\" and a \"cutthroat corporate jungle.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, Amazon announced that it would pay all its workers at least $15 per hour. This move was met with approval from some quarters, with the assumption that higher wages would benefit workers. However, a less discussed aspect of this decision is the potential exclusion of entry-level workers, who may be priced out of the job market due to the increased wage.\n\nCalifornia restaurant manager Merv Crist, in a recent interview, highlighted this issue, stating, \"Minimum wage jobs are an entry-level job to get someone some experience. Raise that high enough, you cut people out of the market completely.\" Crist's perspective underscores the concern that a higher minimum wage, while beneficial to some, may inadvertently exclude those who are just starting their careers or are in need of entry-level jobs.\n\nThe most contentious development, however, is Amazon's decision to lobby for government intervention to enforce the $15 per hour wage across the industry. This move has raised eyebrows, with some viewing it as a strategic move to handcuff competitors and gain a competitive edge.\n\nCritics argue that Bezos, who has been a champion of entrepreneurship and job creation, is now using government to stifle competition and further his own interests. The debate surrounding Amazon's minimum wage policy and its implications on the workforce is a complex one, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the minimum wage issue and its impact on different segments of the workforce.",
    " Title: Analysis of the 40th Republican National Convention: A Closer Look at Romney and Ryan's Post-Convention Bounce\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 40th Republican National Convention has concluded, and political analysts are scrutinizing the poll numbers to determine if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have gained momentum following their convention speeches. The convention, while not as tightly scripted as previous ones, aimed to humanize Romney and present him as a competent and compassionate leader.\n\nOne of the notable decisions made by Romney's convention managers was to avoid revisiting the 2008 election and instead focus on the present and the future. Both Romney and Ryan acknowledged the desire for change that motivated many voters who supported Barack Obama in 2008. They critically evaluated Obama's record in office, expressing disappointment rather than anger.\n\nFormer Democratic Representative Artur Davis eloquently described his disillusionment with the president, a speech that would have been out of place on MSNBC, as it would have contradicted the cable channel's narrative that Republicans are racists.\n\nThe convention also reached out to young voters, who voted 66 to 32 percent for Obama in the last election, with Ryan's reference to twenty-somethings in their childhood bedrooms, \"staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.\" The convention also addressed the sensitive issue of race, acknowledging the historical significance of the first black president and the potential discomfort some voters might feel in rejecting him.\n\nAn unexpected choice was the inclusion of Clint Eastwood at 10:00 Eastern, when the broadcast networks began their hour of coverage. This decision can be attributed to the desire to address the one reason for rejecting the current president: job performance.\n\nThe convention was not as polished as previous ones, with speeches delivered without teleprompters, including Eastwood's and Condoleezza Rice's. The themes of love and respect, as expressed by Ann Romney and Chris Christie, seemed dissonant but can be reconciled. A leader acts out of love for the people but prefers to be feared rather than loved, as Machiavelli taught.\n\nThe convention aimed to humanize Romney by sharing personal anecdotes about his family and service to the community. The testimonies of fellow church members were particularly moving and served to highlight Romney's commitment to service, a quality that is in short supply even among the very rich.\n\nThe convention also addressed concerns that have surfaced in focus groups, such as the candidate's openness to women taking leadership roles, his business background, and his commitment to education. Coming off the convention floor, there was praise for Romney's speech from rank-and-file delegates and limited praise from more experienced observers. This praise, however, is considered high praise in the Republican party, where politicians are seen as tools that are good enough to do the job.\n\nOverall, the 40th Republican National Convention was a strategic and successful event for Romney and Ryan, humanizing the former and reinforcing his competence and compassion. The post-convention bounce remains to be seen, but the convention has undoubtedly left a positive impression on many undecided voters.",
    " Title: White House Aide David Sorensen Resigns Amid Domestic Abuse Allegations, Following Rob Porter's Departure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of resignations within the White House, David Sorensen, a speechwriter, has stepped down following allegations of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Jessica Corbett. This development comes just days after Rob Porter, another White House official, quit over similar allegations from two ex-wives.\n\nAccording to a report by The Washington Post, Corbett claimed that Sorensen was physically abusive during their marriage. She alleged that on separate occasions, her former husband ran a car over her foot, threw her against a wall, and extinguished a cigarette on her hand.\n\nIn response, Sorensen released a statement denying the allegations, stating, \"I have never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life.\" He added that he was considering legal action but resigned because he \"did not want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\"\n\nWhite House officials stated they became aware of the allegations on Thursday, with deputy press secretary Raj Shah commenting, \"We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\"\n\nThe allegations against Porter, who served as White House staff secretary, surfaced on Tuesday. It is alleged that he gave one ex-wife a black eye while another filed a restraining order. Porter also denies these allegations.\n\nPresident Trump paid tribute to Porter on Friday, saying, \"We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well.\" However, Trump did not refer to Porter's accusers, a move that has drawn criticism from Democrats.\n\nThe cases have put pressure on White House Chief-of-Staff John Kelly, who has denied reports he offered to resign over his handling of the accusations. After initially praising Porter as a man of \"integrity,\" Kelly later released a statement saying he was shocked by the claims and stressed domestic violence was unacceptable.\n\nReports suggest that Kelly and other White House officials were aware of the domestic abuse allegations for several months due to delays in Porter's security clearance application. The White House has stated that President Trump was not aware of any security issues before Tuesday and was \"disheartened\" and \"saddened\" by the accusations.\n\nThe handling of the controversy by White House communications director Hope Hicks has reportedly displeased President Trump. Hicks, who is in a relationship with Porter, has been criticized for her role in drafting an initial statement defending Porter.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Porter approached White House Counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 to inform him that his ex-wives might say unflattering things about him to background check investigators. In June 2017, Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office, containing the abuse allegations. In November, McGahn received a call from an ex-girlfriend of Porter alleging physical violence by the aide.\n\nThe ongoing cases have raised questions about the White House's handling of domestic abuse allegations and the security clearance process for its officials.",
    " Title: A Critical Examination of Media Bias and Government Influence in Modern America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, there seems to be a growing sense of disillusionment with the media, as many perceive a shift towards sensationalism and bias in news reporting. This discontent, however, may also be a reflection of personal frustration and a changing political climate.\n\nOne area where this perceived bias is particularly evident is in weather reporting. During the approach of a storm on the East Coast, the media resorted to hyperbolic language such as \"monster storm\" and \"very dangerous,\" which, according to some critics, is a strategy to attract viewership. This approach, however, often oversimplifies the situation and can lead to unnecessary panic.\n\nAnother point of contention is the media's portrayal of government closures during natural disasters or other events. Reporters often state that \"everything is closed\" and \"employees can't get to work,\" implying that private businesses are also affected. However, many private businesses, such as corner grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants, remain open during such times. This discrepancy highlights the difference between government and private sector operations, with the latter being more resilient due to the financial incentives that drive them.\n\nThe media's portrayal of the \"deep state\" in America has also been a subject of debate. In a recent article, The New York Times argued that the concept of a deep state in America is a myth, stating that it presents apolitical civil servants as partisan agents. However, many argue that the \"deep state\" or \"administrative state\" does exist, consisting of regulators who issue hundreds of new rules that stifle innovation and freedom.\n\nThe size of the government workforce is another contentious issue. With more than 20 million Americans working for the government, the media often portrays these individuals as apolitical, but many argue that they are as partisan as the general public. The difficulty in firing government employees due to civil service rules further fuels this perception.\n\nThe media's portrayal of political appointees, such as Scott Pruitt, has also been criticized. When Pruitt stated that he does not agree that man is the \"primary contributor to global warming,\" he was labeled as \"at odds with the established scientific consensus.\" However, this characterization is misleading, as many scientists argue that the cause of global warming is not definitively known.\n\nLastly, the portrayal of socialist countries, such as Venezuela, has been a subject of criticism. In a recent episode of John Oliver's political talk show, the chaos in Venezuela was attributed to a drop in oil prices, without mentioning the country's socialist policies. This oversight, critics argue, obscures the role of socialism in the country's economic and political crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's role in shaping public opinion and understanding is crucial. However, it is essential for journalists to maintain objectivity and accuracy in their reporting, avoiding sensationalism and oversimplification of complex issues. This is particularly important in areas such as weather reporting, government operations, the deep state, political appointees, and the impact of socialist policies.",
    " Title: Divisions Emerge Among Republicans Over Health Care Repeal Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 elections approach, divisions are surfacing among Republicans regarding the strategy for repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Some Republicans, particularly those in swing districts, are advocating for selective retention of certain provisions, while others are pressing for a complete repeal.\n\nRepresentative Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist and freshman Republican from New York, is among those advocating for a selective repeal. She and her allies propose bolstering health savings accounts, allowing for insurance purchases across state lines, imposing medical malpractice limits, and establishing a government-subsidized insurance pool for individuals who cannot buy insurance on their own. However, these alternatives have yet to gain broad support.\n\n\"We need to start expressing our principles promptly,\" said Representative Hayworth.\n\nIn contrast, the first repeal vote, which took place when a new, vigorous Republican majority was confident of voter anger over the health care law, saw a vote of 245-to-189 in favor of repeal, with three Democrats joining in.\n\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, maintains that the health care law was passed \"with deception at its core\" and that the penalty for not purchasing insurance, deemed a tax on the middle class by the Supreme Court, will be a significant factor in the November elections.\n\nHowever, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, Sessions' deputy at the Republican Congressional Committee, is more cautious. \"We're going to be talking about jobs and the economy, but there are lots of elements to that discussion, one of them being health care,\" said Mr. Walden.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, plan to go on the offensive. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has launched an advertising campaign portraying Republicans as beholden to insurance companies and intent on eliminating popular consumer protections in the law. They also plan a series of news conferences featuring real-life families who, they claim, would be adversely affected by repeal.\n\nDemocrats argue that the repeal vote is a political stunt, diverting Congress' attention from job-creating legislation. A video to be released Monday will use Speaker John A. Boehner's phrase, \"Mr. President, where are the jobs?\", to mock the repeal effort.\n\nFor Republicans in conservative districts, the repeal vote serves as a low-risk means to energize the base and demonstrate that the fight against the health care law is ongoing. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from western North Carolina, spoke of the \"fire and passion for repeal\" still simmering in his district.\n\nHowever, Republican campaign consultants express caution. Voters in these districts are already energized by the prospect of voting against President Obama in November. The impact of revisiting the health care debate on independent voters is less clear.\n\nDemocrats are attempting to frame the narrative that voters are ready to move on. Dan Maffei, a former House Democrat from upstate New York running to reclaim his seat, is using the Supreme Court's decision to shift the focus towards improving the health care law he helped pass, rather than debating its continuation or termination. To Maffei, another repeal vote, the 30th this Congress has held, is further evidence of Washington's inability to move forward.\n\n\"They're stuck in this eternal recurrence, rerunning the debate on the bill over and over again instead of moving forward,\" said Maffei.",
    " Title: Surviving the Tides of Globalization: Union City, New Jersey, and the Enduring Legacy of the Embroidery Capital\n\nUnion City, New Jersey, a bustling, densely populated municipality, has managed to thrive economically despite the collapse of its once-thriving embroidery industry. This city, known as the \"embroidery capital of the world\" at the turn of the 20th century, has navigated the challenges of globalization and the shift in manufacturing trends, offering a unique perspective on the impact of federal and global policies on local economies.\n\nThe city's embroidery industry, which flourished due to its strategic geographical location and welcoming immigrant community, was a significant part of the North Hudson industrial landscape. Union City was not only a hub for embroidery but also for a variety of other industries, including breweries, industrial material manufacturers, and a giant soap factory. The city's social fabric was tightly woven with the factory culture, with workers from neighboring towns and beyond frequenting its streets on weekends.\n\nThe transition to unionization was gradual, and Union City became a hotbed of union activity in the early 1900s. The city's Teamsters union, known for its alleged role in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, remains a testament to this history. However, the early and mid-20th century saw many companies moving south due to combined union pressure and highway construction, and the globalization era further accelerated the decline of the embroidery industry.\n\nDespite the collapse of its core industry, Union City has managed to adapt and thrive. Small businesses, New York jobs, and an aggressive push by the municipal government to fill the embroidery void have kept the city economically viable. A few embroidery businesses still operate within the city, producing silk and lace.\n\nThis story, told by a native daughter, is a testament to a city that has survived economically following the destruction of its core industry. However, it is not without its challenges, as the city has lost a critical cultural institution due to business decisions made far beyond its borders. The tale of Union City serves as a reminder of the far-reaching effects of federal and global policies on local economies and the importance of big government intervention, even when local politicians act in good faith.\n\nYet, this is not a tragedy or a rebuke of the local government for growing in the face of external pressures. The alternative was destitution, regression to a ghost town, a fate Union City narrowly escaped in the aftermath of World War II. The story of Union City offers a unique perspective on the resilience of communities in the face of globalization and serves as a warning to those who wish to keep their governments contained, demonstrating that big government policies trickle down, even when local politicians act in good faith.",
    " Title: The Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Hike and Its Potential Impact on the U.S. Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise the federal funds rate following its two-day meeting on Wednesday. This move, which has not been implemented since the financial crisis in 2008, could potentially increase the cost of mortgages, slow job creation, and curb stock prices, but not always.\n\nThe impact of the Fed's tightening largely depends on whether a higher federal funds rate will push up the 10-year Treasury rate. Rates on mortgages, corporate, and municipal bonds generally follow the 10-year Treasury rate up and down. During Ben Bernanke's tenure when the federal funds rate was raised in 2004-2006, those rates remained relatively stable due to the Chinese government's rapid purchase of U.S. bonds to keep the yuan cheap against the dollar.\n\nCurrently, both the Chinese and European economies are experiencing troubles, and their monetary authorities are printing money to lower borrowing costs. Private investors seeking safer and better returns are expected to increase their purchases of U.S. securities, limiting any increase in U.S. long rates. Household balance sheets are in their best shape since the recovery began, and lower gasoline prices provide consumers with more disposable income. These factors should offset the effects of marginally higher short-term interest rates on consumer spending, and economic growth is expected to accelerate to 2.5 to 3 percent in the New Year.\n\nBank fees and car loans will become more expensive due to tighter banking regulations and higher short-term borrowing rates for banks. Banks may attempt to boost fees on checking accounts and other services, and charge higher rates for short-term credit, such as credit cards, car loans, and home improvements. However, the stronger dollar and lower oil prices are currently pinching corporate profits, and hiring has slowed this year to about 210,000 new jobs a month. Small businesses, a significant source of new jobs in an economic recovery, may experience limited additional impact on their access to credit due to somewhat higher short rates.\n\nFinding a job remains challenging for the long-term unemployed, whose skills may have atrophied during the Great Recession and slow recovery. Government benefits, such as expanded Medicaid and food stamps for healthy men, have often overshadowed incentives to reskill. However, household balance sheets are in their best shape since the recovery began, and lower gasoline prices provide consumers with more disposable income. These factors should offset the consequences of marginally higher short-term interest rates on consumer spending, and economic growth should accelerate.\n\nOverall, if Beijing can implement an adequate stimulus program to stabilize its economy, the global economy won't sink America's boat, and job gains will continue. Once gasoline prices have bottomed, overall inflation will rise to about 2 percent. Problems in China and shifts in the broader global economy have caused equity prices to fluctuate recently. However, the Fed rate increase is widely anticipated and is likely already built into equity prices. The market is more likely to react positively to a rate increase simply because uncertainty about timing has been removed.\n\nThe economy has emerged from a tough recession and slow recovery in which the Fed deemed ultra-low interest rates necessary. However, conditions have improved, and in past decades, stock prices have often moved up even as the Fed raised interest rates. This remains a good time to be in stocks, and if you are an investor on the sidelines, gradually start buying in.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Blocks Enforcement of Strict Asylum Policy, Marking Second Legal Setback for Trump Administration's Immigration Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court on Friday prevented the Trump administration from immediately enforcing a new asylum policy that would have denied asylum to immigrants who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. This decision marks the second legal setback this week for efforts to tighten immigration rules.\n\nThe court's brief written order denied a bid to enforce an asylum ban, leaving in place lower-court rulings that blocked the administration from automatically denying asylum to people who do not go through official border crossings. The open-ended nationwide injunction on enforcement, issued by a San Francisco-based federal judge this week, prompted the Justice Department to seek immediate relief from the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts provided the critical vote against the administration, siding with the four liberal justices. Newly confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh and three other conservatives on the bench sided with the administration, according to the order. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, despite having surgery in New York on Friday to remove cancerous nodules in her lung, apparently voted with the majority, avoiding a 4-4 tie.\n\nThe current legal challenge originated in California, where the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also recently ruled against the administration and said the policy was likely \"inconsistent\" with existing law. Trump has stated that he was acting in response to caravans of migrants making their way to the border.\n\nThe Supreme Court order comes after a federal judge in a separate case took the extraordinary step this week of ordering that asylum seekers who had been deported be returned to the U.S. to have their claims heard anew. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan blocked policies that could prevent immigrants who claim to have suffered gang violence or domestic abuse in their home countries from seeking asylum.\n\nIn response, the White House stated that Wednesday's ruling \"will further overwhelm our immigration courts with meritless cases, making the existing massive backlog even worse.\" Despite setbacks in the courts, the administration is moving forward with other changes. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced Thursday that the U.S. has secured an agreement with Mexico so that immigrants claiming asylum will be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed, a bid to end the practice known as \"catch-and-release.\" Nielsen made the announcement at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, telling the committee that the goal is to crack down on migrants falsely claiming asylum, only to be released into the U.S. and escape the radar of immigration officials.",
    " Title: Sen. Chris Van Hollen Proposes Motion to Empower Chief Justice Roberts in Impeachment Trial Witness and Document Decision\n\nIn a move aimed at ensuring a fair and transparent impeachment trial, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) has announced plans to propose a motion on Friday that would grant Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts the authority to decide whether witnesses and documents will be allowed in the trial.\n\n\"A fair trial is one that includes documents and witnesses, and in a fair trial, the judge determines what evidence is admitted,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. \"My motion ensures the Chief Justice will serve the same role as a judge in any trial across our country \u2013 to allow the Senate access to the facts they need to get to the truth.\"\n\nThe motion, if passed, would require the Chief Justice to subpoena witnesses and documents if he deems them likely to provide evidence relevant to the articles of impeachment. It would also empower the Chief Justice to rule on any executive privilege claims, aiming to prevent the Administration from obstructing access to crucial facts.\n\n\"This motion is consistent with Senate rules and could pass with a majority vote, and would preserve the right of the Senate to overrule the Chief Justice if the majority disagrees,\" Van Hollen said. \"No Republican can question the fairness of this approach \u2013 the Chief Justice oversees the highest court in our land and was nominated by a Republican President.\"\n\nDemocrats have long argued that hearing from witnesses, particularly former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, would help clarify the president's alleged wrongdoing. Republicans, on the other hand, have maintained that any witnesses should have been called during the House proceedings. When these individuals were issued Congressional subpoenas, the White House invoked executive privilege.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has acknowledged that the courts could take a significant amount of time to determine whether the officials' testimony constitutes a matter of national security. However, she chose to move forward with the impeachment process rather than wait for a court ruling.\n\nThe proposed motion by Sen. Van Hollen is a significant step towards ensuring a comprehensive and unbiased impeachment trial, with the hope that it will lead to a clearer understanding of the events that transpired. The outcome of the motion remains to be seen, as it is yet to be presented and debated in the Senate.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Ranking Colleges Based on Work-Ready Skills, Sparks Debate on College Value\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-day bus tour of schools last week, President Obama proposed a new plan to rank colleges that rely on federal funding, focusing on metrics such as the percentage of students who complete their education and the earnings of graduates. The plan, however, has not been met with universal approval.\n\nThe proposed rankings aim to provide a more objective measure of a college's quality, moving away from traditional metrics like grade-point averages. The plan is intended to steer federal aid towards institutions with higher rankings, particularly those that keep tuition costs low. This, in turn, is expected to give college applicants and their parents better information when choosing a school.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the Obama plan is that it may not address the primary concern of the modern job market: employers' growing skepticism towards college credentials. The issue is not just grade inflation, which has seen a significant increase in recent decades, but rather the fact that today's workplaces demand a broader set of skills beyond subject-area knowledge, much of which is accessible through an internet search.\n\nThese skills, often referred to as competency-based learning, encompass critical thinking, problem-solving, quantitative reasoning, and the ability to critically evaluate arguments. In essence, graduates should be equipped with the questions to ask for creative solutions in competitive businesses.\n\nA graduate's grade-point average, which is primarily based on discipline-specific knowledge, may not necessarily indicate a good thinker. Nor does graduating from a highly ranked school. A 2011 study titled \"Academically Adrift\" by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that at least 45 percent of college students showed little or no improvement in critical-thinking skills after their first two years in college.\n\nThis aligns with public sentiment, as 57 percent of Americans told Pew pollsters last year that colleges fail to provide students with good value for the money. A 2010 survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found that only 1 in 4 employers believes colleges prepare students for the global economy.\n\nIf lawmakers aim to assist colleges, students, and employers in the education sector, they should consider objective scorecards that measure a graduate's work-ready skills. These tests offer an alternative credential for graduates to present to potential employers, while also holding colleges and universities accountable for the quality of their teaching.\n\nOne such test is the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+), produced by the New York-based nonprofit research organization Council for Aid to Education. The CLA+ offers a credible benchmark on a person's ability to \"access, structure, and use information.\" The test costs $35 and takes approximately 90 minutes to complete.\n\nSeveral states have already tied government aid for colleges to such tests and other measures of \"learning outcomes.\" A few hundred colleges plan to administer the CLA+ tests this year. The tests also provide a means for students who take free or for-profit online courses to earn a credible credential for employment.\n\nAdvanced economies that rely on innovation need advanced thinkers, or those adept at higher-order skills such as perception and creativity. Mr. Obama and Congress need to consider changing the meaning and purpose of the college degree in light of these realities.",
    " Title: McConnell's Decision to Alter Senate Rules on Supreme Court Nominations Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is likely to reshape the Senate and the Supreme Court, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is planning to end the use of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. This decision comes in response to the Democratic opposition to President Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" McConnell stated that if the Democrats had been in power, they would not have filled a Republican president's vacancy. He did not confirm whether Republicans would unilaterally change the Senate rules via the \"nuclear option\" to confirm Gorsuch.\n\nMcConnell's decision to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees is seen as a continuation of a path he forged during his tenure as a senator, both in the minority under President Obama and in the majority. His relentless opposition to President Obama's policies and nominees, including the blockade of Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, led to the Democrats' decision to end the filibuster on lower court nominees.\n\nAdam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Harry Reid, points out in a New York Times op-ed that McConnell's opposition to everything Obama attempted to accomplish led to Reid's decision to end the filibuster on lower court nominees. McConnell's actions, according to Jentleson, included arm-twisting his fellow Republicans into refusing to work with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMcConnell's decision to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees is seen as a significant shift in Senate procedure and could have far-reaching implications for the balance of power in the Supreme Court and the Senate as an institution. Critics argue that McConnell's actions are a departure from the Senate's tradition of bipartisanship and compromise, and could lead to a more polarized and gridlocked Senate.\n\nIn conclusion, McConnell's decision to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees is a controversial move that could reshape the Senate and the Supreme Court. Critics argue that McConnell's actions are a departure from the Senate's tradition of bipartisanship and compromise, and could lead to a more polarized and gridlocked Senate. Supporters of McConnell argue that the Democrats' opposition to Gorsuch left him no choice but to take this action. The outcome of this decision remains to be seen, but it is clear that it will have a significant impact on the Senate and the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Clinton Adopts Sanders' Tone on Economic Inequality, Declines to Release Wall Street Speech Transcripts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of her decisive victory in the New York primary, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton adopted a rhetoric reminiscent of her rival, Bernie Sanders, during a \"Good Morning America\" Town Hall on Thursday. Clinton, who secured a 58-42 victory over Sanders in Tuesday's primary, emphasized her shared goals with Sanders on issues such as income inequality, minimum wage, and financial regulation.\n\n\"Senator Sanders and I both want to tackle inequality,\" Clinton stated. \"We want to raise the minimum wage. We want to make sure that people who are putting our economy at risk are reined in, regulated.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton's stance on income inequality has been a point of contention, particularly among her critics on the left. The issue stems from a series of highly-paid speeches she delivered to financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, following her tenure as Secretary of State. The content of these speeches remains private, and Sanders has urged Clinton to disclose them. Clinton has thus far declined to do so.\n\nWhen asked about the new demand to release transcripts of her speeches, Clinton responded, \"When everybody agrees to do that, I will as well. Because I think it's important we all abide by the same standard.\"\n\nClinton defended her decision to deliver speeches after leaving the Secretary of State office, citing her unique perspective and the public's interest in understanding her views on global affairs. \"When you leave the secretary of state office, people from all perspectives want to know, 'What do you think's going on in the world?' I think that's actually a useful conversation,\" she said, referencing former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice who have also made speeches post-office.",
    " Title: House Republicans Delay August Recess as Border Security Bill Faces Uncertain Future\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the House of Representatives is set to delay their August recess by a day as they scramble to pass a border security bill. The chaotic situation unfolded on Thursday, with House Republicans frantically trying to find a solution to pass the bill before the five-week recess.\n\nAfter a tumultuous afternoon, which saw the GOP leadership abruptly withdraw their legislation from the House floor due to dwindling support, lawmakers planned a Friday morning meeting at 9 a.m. to discuss a potential path forward. However, plans are fluid, and subject to change at any moment, aides and lawmakers cautioned.\n\nIn a Thursday afternoon meeting, Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) listened to a number of Republicans who did not want to leave Washington until a package passed the House. This sentiment was echoed by nearly every lawmaker who emerged after the meeting ended.\n\n\"I'm willing to stay here 'til the cows come home,\" said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.). \"Use your metaphor \u2014 hell freezes over, cows come home.\"\n\nHowever, the votes in support of the original $ 659 million border bill seemed to evaporate throughout Thursday, and it remains unclear if Scalise, whose first day as whip was on Thursday, will be able to regain support for the package.\n\nThe political impact of this decision is not yet clear, but if the House does not vote, Democrats will be able to claim that the GOP left Washington for an entire month without passing legislation to address the influx of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe challenges facing the House bill were evident earlier Thursday, when hard-right conservatives indicated that they were still not satisfied with the last-minute offer of a vote on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in exchange for moving forward on the border funding bill. This bloc demanded tougher border-security and immigration provisions in the supplemental package, while also pressing for the language rolling back DACA to be included in the funding bill.\n\nMore than 57,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, have been apprehended at the southern border since October, exhausting government resources and leading federal agencies to warn that they will begin running out of money in August to deal with the crisis.\n\nBeyond providing funds for the border, the House bill would have revised a 2008 anti-trafficking law that has, in practice, made it more difficult to deport children from countries other than Mexico or Canada. The legislation also called for bolstering National Guard presence on the border.\n\nThe White House criticized the House's plan on Thursday after leaders added the DACA vote. The deferral program was announced by President Barack Obama in June 2012 in the middle of his reelection bid. More than 550,000 young undocumented immigrants who grew up in the United States have been protected from deportation and received work permits under the program.\n\nHowever, Republicans have blamed DACA for contributing to the current crisis on the border, arguing that it sends a message to children from abroad that they, too, could be allowed to stay here lawfully.\n\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this piece misstated the cost of the border bill.\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this piece misstated the cost of the border bill.",
    " Title: California Primary Election: Bernie Sanders Narrows Gap with Hillary Clinton as Tuesday's Vote Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the California primary election nears, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining momentum, potentially posing a significant challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Real Clear Politics, Clinton currently holds an average lead of 10.8 points over Sanders nationwide, but in California, this lead narrows significantly. Sanders trails Clinton by 4.7 points overall and by just two points in two recent polls. In one recent poll reported on Friday, Sanders even surpassed Clinton by one point.\n\nThe Sanders campaign is viewing a potential win in the most populous U.S. state as a reason to continue their bid, believing that a victory could persuade superdelegates who currently support Clinton to switch their allegiances. Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, told MSNBC on Friday, \"The truth of the matter is, there are hundreds and hundreds of Clinton's so-called superdelegates who announced their support for her before there was a race, before we have seen all these recent and consistent polls.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign is keeping a close eye on the ongoing battle. Sam Clovis, Trump's national co-chairman and chief policy adviser, commented to Fox News on Friday that Sanders is \"right over her shoulder,\" and Clinton is making a significant shift to the left as a result.\n\nEven with a decisive win in California, it's unlikely that Sanders will be able to catch up to Clinton, as California is not a winner-take-all delegates race, and its 475 delegates are awarded proportionally. Clinton only needs 256 pledged delegates to clinch the nomination, meaning the superdelegates would not play a significant role. There are 763 pledged delegates still available between now and the Tuesday primaries in California and five other states, meaning Clinton needs to secure just one out of every three delegates.\n\nHowever, if Sanders defeats Clinton, Republicans could use her loss to portray her as a flawed general election candidate, and Sanders could use the victory to stay in the race through the July convention, forcing Clinton to fight a two-front battle for a longer period than she had anticipated. Sanders has been campaigning hard in California since May 17, and Clinton has also opted to spend the last few days in the state, including with a headline-making speech in San Diego where she criticized Trump's foreign policy.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Indiana to Enforce Fetal Remains Disposal Law, Rejects Controversial Abortion Provision\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to allow part of an Indiana law that requires clinics to bury or cremate fetal remains to take effect, but rejected a provision that would prohibit abortions solely motivated by race, sex, or disability.\n\nThe court's decision not to take up the more contentious provision of the Indiana law suggests that there is not a current appetite on the court to challenge the court's core abortion precedents of Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. However, supporters of abortion rights will be disappointed and concerned that the justices allowed the fetal tissue provision to go into effect.\n\nThe law, signed in March 2016 by then-Indiana Governor Mike Pence, was blocked last year from going into effect by the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Pence's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Tuesday. In a pair of tweets, the vice president defended his signing of the law three years ago, saying in one tweet that he was \"proud\" to support the measure and calling the high court's decision \"a victory for life!\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who has been a vocal critic of the court's abortion precedents, agreed that the court was right not to take up the provision at this time, but said justices \"soon need to confront\" the issue. Thomas wrote, \"Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we can not avoid them forever.\"\n\nIn his decision last year, Judge William Bauer wrote that provisions in the law that bar women from seeking abortions in certain cases \"clearly violate\" what he described as \"well-established Supreme Court precedent, and are therefore, unconstitutional.\"\n\nJustice Thomas spent 15 pages discussing the history of eugenics in his decision. He argued that enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child would \"constitutionalize the views of the 20th Century eugenic movement.\"\n\nThomas also expressed his support for the provision of the law that requires fetal remains to be buried or cremated. He wrote, \"I would have thought it could go without saying that nothing in the Constitution or any decision of this Court prevents a State from requiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful treatment of human remains.\"\n\nIndiana's law requires that fetal remains be disposed of in the same way as other human remains (i.e., burial and cremation). A separate provision in the law says that the state can prohibit abortion that is solely motivated by the race, sex, or disability of the fetus. The law has been blocked from going into effect by lower courts.\n\nIn court papers, Curtis Hill Jr., Indiana's attorney general, said the language \"expands on long-established legal and cultural traditions of recognizing the dignity and humanity of the fetus.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Thomas's writing does not mean the court will immediately take up the large issue. \"Although Justice Thomas argues that the court will soon have to take up the issue it ducked today, I think it's telling that none of the other conservative justices -- John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh -- joined his separate opinion,\" Vladeck said.\n\n\"It's quite possible that Thomas's opinion is therefore less a prediction of where the court is likely to go than an aspiration,\" Vladeck added. \"At least for now, the rest of the conservatives do not seem eager to jump into this sensitive political thicket.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Congressional Disapproval of Iran Nuclear Deal Does Not Hinder President Obama's Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, the strong bipartisan disapproval by Congress of the Iranian nuclear deal will not prevent President Obama from implementing the agreement, as the vote next month is shaping up as a warning to Europe against resuming business with Tehran before the next U.S. president is elected.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, the highest-profile Democrat to endorse the deal, has stated that he will attempt to sway other members of his party. However, clear bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate are lining up against the deal.\n\nDespite this, President Obama has broad executive authority to ease many sanctions on Iran by himself, according to analysts. Acting on his own, Mr. Obama can delist Iranian banks, commercial entities, and individuals targeted for sanctions. He can also order the Treasury Department to give out licenses allowing financial and commercial transactions with Iranian businesses.\n\nThe president could provide sanctions relief for Iranian oil exports by treating legislation passed by Congress in 2012 as unconstitutional. Section 1245 of the National Defense Authorization Act required the president to freeze assets of Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran, and aimed to reduce Iranian oil revenue by imposing sanctions on foreign banks that carry out \"significant financial transactions\" with the central bank.\n\nHowever, Mr. Obama issued a \"signing statement\" on Section 1245 when he approved the overall legislation, stating that he could treat that section as nonbinding because it \"would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.\"\n\n\"He would challenge Republicans to fight him in the courts,\" said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of the agreement. \"He would essentially just circumvent that statutory designation and provide significant sanctions relief.\"\n\nMr. Obama will continue to make his case for the Iranian deal Friday when he addresses Jewish organizations and takes questions in a webcast. In addition to Mr. Reid, the White House picked up the support of Rep. Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, after Mr. Obama wrote a letter to the lawmaker offering specific assurances that the U.S. would \"take whatever means are necessary\" to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, including possible military action.\n\nWhile the president was on vacation, more lawmakers announced which way they will vote when Congress takes up the Iran agreement in mid-September. So far, 29 senators, including two Democrats, are voting against the agreement. Twenty-six senators are supporting it, with 45 uncommitted, but it's almost a certainty that all 54 Republican senators will vote against the deal.\n\nIn the House, 225 lawmakers\u2014including 16 Democrats\u2014have announced that they would vote against the deal, according to a tally compiled by the Bipartisan Policy Center. There are 69 House lawmakers in favor of the deal so far, and 140 are uncommitted.\n\nRep. Donald Norcross, New Jersey Democrat whose district includes a sizable Jewish community, said he would vote against the agreement. \"I do believe that a better deal can be achieved,\" Mr. Norcross said. \"We have not exhausted all efforts.\"\n\nDespite the opposition, lawmakers would need to muster a two-thirds majority vote in the House and the Senate to override Mr. Obama's expected veto of the Iran resolution. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has said a veto override is unlikely.\n\nHowever, the ultimate size of the vote against the agreement will influence European governments and industries about the prospects of U.S. policymakers seeking a tougher deal after Mr. Obama leaves office. European leaders and business chiefs \"would be reticent to rush back in if there was a resounding vote of disapproval,\" said Mr. Dubowitz. \"They would want to know what the next president is going to do before they found themselves on the wrong end of an enforcement action.\"",
    " Title: Liberal Journalists' Definition of 'Fake News' Sparks Controversy and Concerns Over Censorship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory, a wave of criticism against \"fake news\" has swept through liberal journalism circles, with some blaming it for the perceived disconnect between political journalists and the general public. However, the definition of \"fake news\" remains elusive, with many journalists conflating leading conservative and alternative media outlets with websites that peddle viral hoaxes.\n\nLeft-leaning media outlets, such as BuzzFeed News, have been accused of misleading the public in the pursuit of a narrative. For instance, BuzzFeed News' coverage of \"fake news\" has focused on hoax websites run by teenagers in Macedonia, such as the false claim that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, other left-leaning news organizations have lumped legitimate news organizations alongside objectively false sources. A list of \"fake news\" sites compiled by a liberal college professor, which was uncritically accepted and distributed by some liberal journalists, included top right-of-center sites like Independent Journal Review (IJR) and The Blaze alongside objectively fake sites.\n\nThe Washington Post labeled one such website as \"fake news\" without providing any evidence, a move that has led to a potential defamation lawsuit. In an article last summer, liberal New York Magazine writer Brian Feldman argued that \"conservative news\" and \"fake news\" are the same thing.\n\nThe conflation of legitimate news sources with objectively false sites, coupled with calls for censorship of fake news, has raised concerns that the crackdown on fake news sites\u2014the influence of which remains unknown\u2014will be used by liberals to censor their conservative competitors.\n\nSome argue that this is an attempt by some liberals to invite government control over First Amendment-protected speech or to make Facebook and Twitter into even stricter censors of certain views. The Media Research Center director of media analysis, Tim Graham, warned that the liberal definition of \"fake news\" could be used to suppress stories that should not be explored, such as the paying for protesters.\n\nConservative website The Daily Wire was listed as \"fake news\" without justification, leading contributor John Nolte to warn that the \"fake news\" label is being used by frustrated liberal journalists to censor conservative viewpoints. Nolte wrote, \"The mainstream media put itself on the 2016 presidential ballot, lost, and now they want to silence competing ideas by smearing, marginalizing, and, yes, blacklisting us as spreaders of Fake News.\"\n\nThese concerns highlight the need for a clear and consistent definition of \"fake news\" to prevent the misuse of the term for political gain or censorship purposes. The ongoing debate underscores the importance of maintaining a free and open media landscape, where all viewpoints can be expressed and debated without fear of censorship or mischaracterization.",
    " Title: Over 250 Foreign Students Arrested in Detroit for Immigration Violations in Sting Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, about 90 additional foreign students at a fake university in metro Detroit have been arrested in recent months, bringing the total number of students arrested since January to approximately 250. The students were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of a sting operation by federal agents who posed as university officials at the University of Farmington, a school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies.\n\nThe students, mostly from India, had arrived legally in the U.S. on student visas but lost their immigration status when the University of Farmington was revealed to be a creation of federal agents and was shut down in January. The university was staffed with undercover agents posing as university officials.\n\nOut of the approximately 250 students arrested on administrative charges, nearly 80% were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States, according to ICE officials. Of the remaining 20%, about half have received a final order of removal, with some ordered removed by an immigration judge and others given an expedited removal by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The remaining 10% have either filed for some sort of relief or are contesting their removals with the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\n\nThe University of Farmington was created a few years ago by federal law enforcement officials with ICE. Records filed with the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs show that the University of Farmington was incorporated in January 2016. Many of the students had enrolled with the university through a program known as Curricular Practical Training, which allows students to work in the U.S through a F-1 visa program for foreign students. Some had transferred to the University of Farmington from other schools that had lost accreditation, which meant they would no longer be allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\nEmails obtained by the Free Press this year showed how the fake university attracted students to the school, which cost about $12,000 on average in tuition and fees per year. The U.S. government is believed to have collected millions of dollars from the unsuspecting students. No one has filed a lawsuit or claim against the U.S. government for collecting the money or for allegedly entrapping the students.\n\nAttorneys for ICE and the Department of Justice maintain that the students should have known it was not a legitimate university because it did not have classes in a physical location. Some CPT programs have classes combined with work programs at companies.\n\nRahul Reddy, a Texas attorney who represented or advised some of the students arrested, told the Free Press this week, \"They preyed upon on them.\" The seven of the eight recruiters who were criminally charged with trying to recruit students have pleaded guilty and been sentenced in Detroit. The remaining defendant will be sentenced in January.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the U.S. foreign-student visa program, with some students who transferred from the University of Farmington after realizing they didn't have classes on-site still being arrested. Detroit ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said the recruiters sentenced so far include Barath Kakireddy, 29, of Lake Mary, Florida, 18 months; Suresh Kandala, 31, of Culpeper, Virginia, 18 months; Santosh Sama, 28, of Fremont, California, 24 months; Avinash Thakkallapally, 28, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 15 months; Aswanth Nune, 26, of Atlanta, 12 months; Naveen Prathipati, 26, of Dallas, 12 months. Phanideep Karnati, 35, of Louisville, Kentucky, is to be sentenced in January.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Email Use as Secretary of State: A National Security Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent report by the State Department's Inspector General has shed light on the controversial email practices of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her tenure. The report reveals that Clinton's decision to use a personal email server for official business, instead of an official State Department account, posed a significant threat to national security.\n\nThe report details four distinct warnings that Clinton and her team received regarding the security risks of her email system. In January 2011, hackers attempted to breach her private server, prompting the shutdown of the server twice. In March 2011, a memo was sent to Clinton warning of increased attempts to compromise the private email accounts of senior department officials. In May 2011, Clinton herself suspected a hacking incident, and in June 2011, the State Department issued a cable warning about the dangers of unsecured personal email accounts.\n\nThese warnings, spanning six months, should have alerted any responsible public official to the national security risks of unsecured email communications. However, Clinton and several of her top aides continued to use personal email for sensitive State Department business thousands of times.\n\nClinton's refusal to cooperate with the investigation, despite being contacted by the Obama-appointed inspector general, has raised questions about her accountability and transparency. While Clinton's silence may be a strategic move, it is a concern for those who question her ability to prioritize national security over personal self-interest.\n\nThe report's findings come at a time when Clinton is under potential criminal investigation by the FBI for the mishandling of classified material sent through her email. As she seeks the presidency, Clinton will need to address these concerns and convince voters that she can prioritize the national security of the United States above her own interests.\n\nIt is clear that Clinton broke the rules regarding email usage during her tenure as Secretary of State. The question now is whether she also broke the law.\n\nThis editorial reflects the opinions of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Editorial Board, separate from the news staff. Most editorials include an opposing view, a unique \u2588\u2588\u2588 feature.\n\nFollowing the publication of this editorial, CNN's Jake Tapper asked Clinton to respond to the criticism. Clinton stated that it was \"obvious\" that she has always put national security above personal self-interest.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Reveals Over 500,000 Visitors Overstayed in 2015, Exposing Immigration Enforcement Loophole\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing before the Senate on Wednesday, Homeland Security officials disclosed that approximately 99 percent of illegal immigrants who entered the country legally but overstayed their visas in 2015 were not investigated. This revelation, according to critics, highlights a significant loophole in immigration enforcement and national security.\n\nThe report, released late Tuesday, indicates that while those who pose security threats or commit serious crimes are scrutinized, the majority of the over 500,000 visitors who did not depart when their visas expired in 2015 were deemed non-priorities. Some of these individuals may have left voluntarily, but it is possible that hundreds of thousands remain undetected within the illegal immigrant population.\n\nThe report also reveals that among the overstayers are thousands from countries with terrorism connections, including 219 from Afghanistan, 681 from Iraq, 564 from Iran, 56 from Libya, 1,435 from Pakistan, 440 from Syria, and 219 from Yemen in fiscal year 2015 alone.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican and chairman of the immigration subcommittee, expressed concern, stating, \"This is the way the system gets eroded. This is where public confidence is being destroyed. This is how we\u2019re sending a message to the world that you can get away with it.\"\n\nThe report shows that almost all of the 45 million temporary visas issued to business and tourist travelers between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015, were honored, meaning the visitors left on time. However, the 1.17 percent defiance rate still resulted in 527,127 individuals overstaying, and, as of three months later, more than 400,000 of them were still likely in the U.S. When combined with previous years\u2019 overstays, the numbers \"must be in the millions,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican.\n\nThe government deported only about 2,500 visa overstays last year, and has only about 3,000 active cases\u2014accounting for just a small fraction of the problem. Craig C. Healy, assistant director of National Security Investigations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated, \"Probably the chances are that in our prioritization scheme, we will not get to those individuals unless they rise to the level that it meets either the national security, the criminal or the secretary\u2019s priorities.\"\n\nThe report does not cover major visa categories for students or guest workers, both of which analysts said are likely to be even worse than the tourism and business visas, as students and guest workers often put down roots over the course of years spent in the U.S. Homeland Security officials said these other overstay figures will be released next year.\n\nCongress two decades ago demanded the department implement biometric checks at both entry and exit from the country for foreigner visitors. While the checks are in place on arrival, there is still no biometric exit system, and the government relies on passenger information from airlines to complete its checks. This leaves the system susceptible to errors or fraud that a biometric system, based on fingerprints, could solve.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a solution, particularly after Congress recently dedicated $1 billion from visa fees to be spent on the problem. John Wagner, deputy assistant commissioner at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, stated that the challenge is finding a way to do the checks without disrupting international travel at airports. He said most airports don\u2019t have space at departure gates to screen outgoing travelers, and they are trying to experiment with hand-held devices or other ways to reach passengers as they leave.\n\nJessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, stated that the high rate of overstays, coupled with the surge of Central Americans coming across the southwest border, likely means the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is rising. She also expressed concern about the high rate of overstays in visitors from visa-waiver countries, particularly those from Greece, where nearly 3 percent of visitors overstayed. The worst offenders, though, were still regular visa countries such as Djibouti and Bhutan, where about a quarter of all visitors overstayed in 2015.",
    " Title: Thousands Download 3D-Printed Gun Blueprints Amidst Legal Challenges and Presidential Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial turn of events, blueprints for 3D-printed guns, initially scheduled for public release on Wednesday, have been made available four days early following a ruling from the US Justice Department. The designs for nine types of guns were uploaded to the Defense Distributed website on Friday, sparking immediate downloads in thousands and subsequent legal action.\n\nThe controversy surrounding 3D-printed guns dates back to 2013 when Cody Wilson, a self-styled crypto-anarchist, unveiled the world's first 3D-printed gun. Files detailing the process were promptly made available on the Defense Distributed website, leading to hundreds of thousands of downloads. This prompted the US State Department to order their removal from the internet.\n\nA four-year legal battle ensued, with Defense Distributed joining forces with the Second Amendment Foundation - an organization dedicated to defending the right to own guns - to sue the State Department. In a surprising move last month, the US Justice Department ruled that Americans may \"access, discuss, use, and reproduce\" the technical data.\n\nThis decision has led to a backlash from lawmakers, and on Monday, Washington State attorney general Bob Ferguson announced that a multi-state legal action would be filed to block the ruling, representing eight US states. In a statement, Mr. Ferguson stated, \"These downloadable guns are unregistered and very difficult to detect, even with metal detectors, and will be available to anyone regardless of age, mental health, or criminal history.\"\n\nTwenty-one attorneys general, including those from California, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, had previously sent a letter to the State Department, asking it to reinstate its ban on the blueprints. The letter expressed concerns that the settlement terms and proposed rules could have an \"unprecedented impact on public safety.\"\n\n\"As the chief law enforcement officers of our states, we believe the settlement terms and proposed rules are deeply dangerous,\" the letter stated. \"In addition to helping arm terrorists and transnational criminals, the settlement and proposed rules would provide another path to gun ownership for people who are prohibited by federal and state law from possessing firearms.\"\n\nCody Wilson has celebrated his victory as the beginning of \"the age of the downloadable gun.\" However, critics are concerned that this development will result in a significant increase in so-called ghost guns, unregistered weapons that the government is unaware of and unable to trace. Since the legal action began, Defense Distributed has been working on new gun designs and has also created a milling device - known as Ghost Gunner - that can turn parts purchased online into a fully functioning weapon.",
    " Title: Impeachment Process: A Look at the Legal and Political Implications of the Ukraine-Related Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political development, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that Democrats will draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Pelosi, in a stern tone, compared Trump to an \"oppressive monarch\" or a \"king president,\" warning that allowing a president to be above the law could potentially endanger the republic.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that President Trump is not above the law, but Democrats have yet to identify any specific violations of law during the Ukraine-related inquiry. In a largely overlooked portion of his testimony, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman stated that the National Security Council found the 55-day pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to be lawful.\n\nThe impeachment process, as Pelosi acknowledged, is political, not legal. The impeachment inquiry revolves around President Trump's request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, Ukrainian hacking of DNC computers, and corruption accusations against the Bidens. This request conformed to the U.S.\u2013Ukraine Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed by President Clinton in 1998 and ratified by the Senate in 2000.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine agreed to provide mutual assistance in connection with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of offenses and proceedings related to criminal matters. Trump and Zelensky conferred on investigating, prosecuting, and preventing possible Ukrainian campaign intervention and any conceivable corruption between the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that reportedly paid board member Hunter Biden $83,333 per month while his father was involved with U.S.\u2013Ukrainian policy as America's Vice President.\n\nThe aid pause was within Trump's responsibility to ensure that the $391 million did not vanish down a black hole of graft. OMB official Mark Sandy testified that he attributed the hold to the President's concern about other countries not contributing money to Ukraine, echoing Trump's statements on this matter.\n\nDelays in foreign aid are not uncommon. For instance, President Trump withheld $300 million in aid to Pakistan last year for neglecting its anti-terrorism commitments, while Obama chopped aid to Uganda in 2014 after it adopted cruel anti-gay statutes. Human-rights concerns prompted President Carter to slice aid to Argentina, Ethiopia, and Uruguay.\n\nDespite the controversy, Ukraine received its lethal military aid on September 11. If those funds were unallocated on October 1, that would have been illegal. However, these funds beat the September 30 Fiscal Year-end deadline by 19 days, similar to paying one's taxes on March 27 instead of April 15.\n\nWhile the impeachment process is political, the focus of the inquiry is on President Trump's adherence to one law, legal opinion, or precedent after another. The impeachment process aims to address political, rather than legal, misconduct. The outcome of the impeachment inquiry remains to be seen, but it is essential to maintain a clear understanding of the facts and the legal context surrounding the inquiry.",
    " Title: Dave Chappelle's Controversial Stand-up Special \"Sticks & Stones\" Sparks Debate Over Comedian's Approach to Controversy\n\nIn a return to Netflix, comedian Dave Chappelle unveiled his new stand-up special, \"Sticks & Stones,\" which includes a secret epilogue titled \"The Punchline.\" The special, which takes Chappelle's anti-wokeness stance to new heights, has sparked debate among fans and critics alike.\n\nThe special, which delves into Chappelle's controversial views on topics such as the Michael Jackson molestation allegations, transgender individuals, and fellow comedians Kevin Hart and Louis C.K., has been met with mixed reactions. Chappelle's comments, including his defense of controversial figures and his repeated jokes about marginalized groups, have been criticized for their insensitivity and lack of empathy.\n\nDuring the Q&A segment at the end of the special, Chappelle's unapologetic approach to courting controversy became even more apparent. He shared a story about a white woman who left one of his practice sets, telling him she had been raped. Chappelle's response, \"It's not your fault you were raped. But it's not my fault either. Ta-ta, bitch,\" was met with laughter from the audience.\n\nChappelle's comments and actions have been criticized for their insensitivity and lack of empathy, with some arguing that he is only interested in repairing his relationship with marginalized groups if he doesn't have to change anything about himself.\n\nThroughout his career, Chappelle has been known for his daredevil approach to comedy, taking controversial stances and downplaying serious controversies for laughs. However, his recent work has drawn criticism for ignoring historical criticism and new, clear criticism from the trans community.\n\nAs Chappelle continues to push the boundaries of comedy, some worry that he is tarnishing his own legacy with his defiant rejection of change at any cost. The debate over Chappelle's approach to comedy and his comments on sensitive topics will likely continue to rage on.",
    " Title: Foxconn Shifts Focus of Wisconsin Campus from Manufacturing to Research Hub\n\nAritcle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, electronics giant Foxconn Technology Group announced on Wednesday that its planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus will no longer focus on blue-collar manufacturing but will instead be a research hub, staffed primarily by scientists and engineers. The move has been met with criticism as the project, initially touted by President Donald Trump as a sign of a resurgence in American manufacturing, was promised to bring 13,000 jobs to the Midwest.\n\nThe Taiwan-based company, a major supplier to Apple and the world's largest contract maker of electronics, stated in a press release that it remains committed to Wisconsin and the creation of 13,000 jobs as promised. However, due to the global market environment shift since the project was announced in 2017, \"this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects.\"\n\nWisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, a Democrat, expressed disappointment, stating, \"We were promised manufacturing jobs. We were promised state-of-the-art LCD production... And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S.\u2014leaving another state and community high and dry.\"\n\nEconomic development officials and supporters of the project urged patience, emphasizing that Foxconn still plans to invest what it promised. The White House had no immediate comment.\n\nAccording to reports, Foxconn wants to create a \"technology hub,\" with about three-quarters of the jobs in research and development and design. These jobs typically go to college graduates. The plant is under construction and scheduled to open in 2020.\n\nLouis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn's CEO, was quoted as telling Reuters that it is scaling back and possibly shelving plans to build display screens in Wisconsin because \"we can't compete.\"\n\nThe company initially billed the massive 20 million-square-foot (1.86 million-square-meter) Wisconsin complex as its first North American manufacturing site for the next generation of display panels to be used in a wide variety of products, including large-screen TVs, self-driving cars, notebooks, and other monitors.\n\nWisconsin state and local governments promised roughly $4 billion to Foxconn, the richest incentive package in state history and the biggest pledged by a state to a foreign corporation in U.S. history. Foxconn was required to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs to receive the full incentives.\n\nIn 2019, the company had already fallen short of its job creation targets, hiring 178 full-time employees rather than the 260 targeted, and failing to earn a state tax credit worth up to $9.5 million.\n\nFormer Governor Scott Walker, the Republican who brokered the deal, emphasized in a tweet that Foxconn earns tax credits only for actual investment and job creation. \"No jobs/investment? No credits. Period,\" Walker tweeted.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders who pushed the project blamed new Democratic Governor Tony Evers for Foxconn's change in plans, stating that he had created an air of economic uncertainty by supporting the elimination of a manufacturing tax credit program.\n\nEvers was critical of Foxconn in the campaign against Walker but did not pledge to undo the deal. His top aide Joel Brennan said that the administration was surprised by the news from Foxconn. He did not address the accusations that Evers was to blame.\n\nDemocratic critics have long argued that the incentives promised to Foxconn were too rich, and they questioned whether the company would ever fulfill its promises.\n\nThe president of Wisconsin's Technology Council, Tom Still, said he is not surprised Foxconn wants to change course since televisions are becoming less expensive and iPhone sales are declining. Still, whose group nurtures technology in Wisconsin, said Foxconn can succeed if the plant becomes more research-oriented because its areas of interest match up with Wisconsin's strengths, such as robotics, medical imaging, and industrial imaging.\n\nLast summer, Trump highlighted his economic policies at a groundbreaking event for the Foxconn complex. \"Made in the USA: It's all happening and it's happening very, very quickly,\" the president said in June after visiting the Foxconn site. \"Today we're seeing the results of the pro-America agenda.\"",
    " Title: The Controversial Minimum Wage Hike: A Closer Look at the Economic Implications and Constitutional Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent political discourse, a contentious issue has arisen regarding the role of government in dictating minimum wages for employees. This article delves into the potential implications of such a policy, questioning whether it represents an intrusion into the employer-employee relationship and a transfer of wealth through governmental force.\n\nThe debate centers around the minimum wage, which is on the verge of being raised to $15 per hour in many areas. Critics argue that this figure is based on political compromise rather than free market forces or economic realities, and that it may have profound, unintended economic consequences.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is that the increase in wages will lead to higher prices for goods and services, effectively transferring wealth not from employers to employees, but from consumers to employees. This could potentially make certain goods and services unaffordable for some, particularly those who rely on them.\n\nAnother concern is the potential for increased unemployment due to employers' inability to afford the higher wages. This could disproportionately affect the very people the policy is intended to help, as they may lose the self-esteem and opportunities for advancement that come with employment.\n\nThe question of constitutionality also arises, with critics arguing that the government's interference in the employer-employee relationship and the free market violates the Constitution's protection of the right to exchange goods and services. They argue that the government has fundamental misunderstandings of the way businesses earn money, create wealth, and pay salaries, and that the government's mindset is one of control and central planning rather than competition and consumer appeal.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning whether the minimum wage increase is a politically motivated move to win votes, rather than a genuine effort to help the working class. It calls for a closer examination of the economic and constitutional implications of such policies, and for a return to the principles of free market competition and individual rights enshrined in the Constitution.",
    " Title: Senate Delays Vote on Military Airstrikes in Syria as Opposition Grows\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama's push for congressional approval for military airstrikes in Syria has faced a setback as opposition grows among senators from both parties. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced a delay in a procedural vote, citing the need for the president to address all senators and the American public before making a decision.\n\nSix senators, including five Republicans and one Democrat, have announced their intention to vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force, indicating that the administration's efforts to build bipartisan support have been unsuccessful. The Senate was initially scheduled to vote on a procedural motion to begin formal debate on the resolution on Wednesday, but the vote has been postponed to give the president more time to make his case.\n\nThe delay comes amid reports that Russia is seeking a deal with Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. President Obama stated in television interviews on Monday that such a deal could potentially obviate the need for U.S. military intervention, but senators have expressed skepticism due to a lack of briefing on the development.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) stated, \"I have no idea what's going on. It'd be great if the Russians could convince Assad to turn over his chemical weapons to the international community. That'd be a terrific outcome. I just am very dubious and skeptical.\"\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry's comments made in London describing the military effort as \"unbelievably small\" also raised concerns among lawmakers. Sen. Graham stated that Kerry's remarks \"undercut everything the president has been doing for the last couple of days\" to build support.\n\nThe rapid succession of senators announcing their opposition on Monday has cast serious doubts on the president's ability to garner the necessary support in either the House or Senate. The GOP-led House is unlikely to take up a resolution unless the Senate can pass it first. A final Senate vote was initially expected this weekend, but Reid's decision to delay the formal debate has put the schedule in flux.\n\nFive GOP senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming, have announced their opposition, as well as Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.\n\nSen. Heitkamp is the latest in a string of Democratic senators from conservative states to come out in opposition, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.). Heitkamp and Manchin are working on an alternative resolution that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin turning over its chemical weapons before authorizing U.S. military action.\n\nTwo Democratic senators, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, have declared their support. However, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who voted for the resolution in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned on Monday that he preferred pursuing diplomatic solutions.\n\nThe opposition underscores the uphill battle President Obama faces on Capitol Hill to rally support around his foreign policy agenda. The president will meet separately with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans on Tuesday before his prime-time television address.\n\nSen. Graham, who supports the resolution, believes it could still pass the Senate: \"If the president does a good job tomorrow night, yes.\"",
    " Title: North Korean Delegation Concludes Visit to South Korea, Summit Invitation Remains Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nSEOUL, South Korea - North Korea's high-level delegation, led by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, concluded its three-day visit to South Korea on Sunday, following \"frank and candid\" talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The visit, the highest-ranking to the South, was marked by a series of meetings, dinners, and cultural performances, but the North made no mention of an invitation for Moon to visit Pyongyang for a summit.\n\nThe delegation's itinerary included four meetings with Moon, a lunch hosted by South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon, and a farewell dinner hosted by Moon's chief of staff. The highlight was a performance by a North Korean orchestra, the last item on their schedule before returning home on Monday.\n\nDuring Sunday's dinner, Kim Yo Jong expressed her surprise at the similarities she observed in the South and expressed hope to meet \"friendly faces\" in Pyongyang. In a significant gesture, she handed over a personal letter from Kim Jong Un to Moon during Saturday's lunch at the presidential Blue House in Seoul.\n\nSouth Korean officials confirmed that Moon had been invited to Pyongyang for a meeting with Kim Jong Un, but the North Korean state news agency KCNA did not mention this invitation in its report. Such a meeting, if it occurs, would mark the first inter-Korea summit since 2007.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who returned to Washington after attending the Winter Olympics opening, reiterated the U.S., South Korea, and Japan's commitment to isolating North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe visit was met with applause and enthusiasm, with the North Korean orchestra's performances drawing large crowds. The nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam, was seen shedding tears and clapping enthusiastically during the shows.\n\nHowever, the visit also faced skepticism, with South Korea's main opposition party warning that any talks without denuclearization as a precondition would only benefit North Korea. Japanese editorials echoed similar concerns, emphasizing the need for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula for any dialogue to be meaningful.\n\nAs the delegation departed for Pyongyang, the future of inter-Korean relations hangs in the balance, with both sides expressing a desire for improved relations but remaining cautious about the intentions of the other.",
    " Title: USCIS Admits Approval of DACA for Murder Suspect Jesus Rangel-Hernandez\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has admitted that Jesus Rangel-Hernandez, a North Carolina resident charged with four counts of first-degree murder, should not have been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) due to his criminal background.\n\nAccording to a letter from USCIS to Senator Grassley, Rangel-Hernandez, who is an illegal alien, requested DACA on January 22, 2013, while he was in removal proceedings. Despite having a record of a 2012 arrest for marijuana possession, which resulted in dismissed charges, and being identified as a known gang member, Rangel-Hernandez's DACA request was approved on August 26, 2013.\n\nRangel-Hernandez was scheduled for deportation but was able to stay in the country due to the DACA approval. In February 2015, he is alleged to have committed four murders in North Carolina. The victims' bodies were found in a Charlotte home on Tuesday, and police have not disclosed the method of their deaths.\n\nRangel-Hernandez is also charged in connection with a murder at a motel on Sunday. North Carolina Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis have expressed their concerns over the approval of Rangel-Hernandez's DACA application, stating that the flawed implementation of the program allows dangerous criminals to stay in the country, even known gang members.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing today examining the Obama administration's Central American Minors Refugee and Parole Program in light of the unaccompanied minor crisis last summer, during which MS-13 gang members reportedly used Border Patrol processing centers as recruitment areas and easy access points to the United States.",
    " Title: CBO Report Highlights Income-Based Shift in Senate Republicans' Tax Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to a potential full Senate vote, the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides a clearer picture of the impact of the Senate tax overhaul on various income groups. The CBO report, released on Sunday, not only analyzes the bill's effect on individual taxes but also examines the spending cuts the GOP tax plan would trigger and how these cuts would affect the rich and poor.\n\nOur analysis of the new data reveals that the Senate Republicans' bill would disproportionately benefit upper and upper-middle-class Americans, while lower-income groups would face overall losses.\n\nThe CBO report shows that lower-income groups would experience losses per person or family in this plan. However, the losses for lower-income groups are significantly smaller compared to the substantial gains, up to $59,000 per tax filer, at the upper end of the income scale.\n\nIt's important to note that the wealthy may receive a larger nominal benefit due to their higher incomes. However, when we consider the midpoint income in each group and divide the overall effect on the group by that income amount, the wealthy not only gain the most in dollar amounts but also gain the most relative to their income.\n\nFor instance, Americans making $10,000 to $20,000 would see barely any change, with a loss worth just 0.14% of their income next year. In contrast, Americans making $500,000 to $1 million next year would see a net benefit that's worth nearly 3% of their income.\n\nFurthermore, when we consider the population size of each group, the data shows a clear reversal: lower-income groups have a larger number of taxpayers but would benefit far less from this tax overhaul. Higher-income groups have fewer taxpayers, but would gain many times more from the GOP bill.\n\nThe Republicans argue that the wealthy, while fewer in number, pay for a larger portion of U.S. taxes. This is part of their argument for a sweeping change that goes beyond tax cuts or tax reform. However, these numbers suggest that the GOP tax plan is a shift in the opposite direction, moving resources from the poor to the rich.",
    " Title: Women Candidates in Key Senate Races Could Determine Control of the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, women are making a significant impact in several key Senate races. The outcome of these races could determine whether the Republicans will flip the six Democratic-held seats needed to gain control of the Senate.\n\nOne of the most prominent Senate races this election year is in Kentucky, where the marquee contest between Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has gender at its core. Grimes, in her primary victory speech, declared, \"I am not an empty dress.\" In Oregon, Republican hopeful and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby, running as a political outsider, emphasized her qualifications, stating, \"I am a doctor, a mom.\" In Georgia, the retirement of a Republican senator has led to an unexpectedly popular would-be Democratic replacement in Michelle Nunn, who boasted, \"Washington is going to learn a thing or two from our campaign.\"\n\nIn addition to these candidates, vulnerable female senators in Louisiana, North Carolina, and New Hampshire are also in the race. The balance of power in the Senate could hinge on the performance of these women candidates from both parties.\n\nIn Kentucky, Grimes is running a strong challenge against McConnell, stating, \"I am a strong Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker.\" Grimes is appealing to female voters, who make up more than half the Kentucky electorate, and is leveraging the fact that polls show 30-year Senate veteran McConnell is especially unpopular with women.\n\nWhen asked about a potential gender gap problem ahead of his Republican primary, McConnell responded, \"We'll find out in November, won't we?\" He acknowledged that women in Kentucky have been treated poorly in the current environment, but his appeal to women belies a more nuanced approach. In his victory speech, McConnell spoke glowingly of his late mother and his wife Elaine Chao, a former cabinet secretary under George W. Bush. He also shared stories of three Kentucky women allegedly hurt by President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nAnother significant hope for Democrats picking up a GOP Senate seat is Michelle Nunn in Georgia. \"I believe that change is possible,\" she said in a speech on Tuesday.\n\nIn West Virginia, the race between Shelley Moore Capito and Democrat Natalie Tennant could result in the state's first female senator, regardless of the outcome. There are currently 20 women senators, a record but still far from representative of the country, which is more than 50% female. 2014 could mark another historic number.",
    " Title: President Trump Revives Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, Kicking Off Energy Revolution and Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move widely anticipated, President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday, reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. The orders, which were met with approval from Republican allies, are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant economic benefits, according to the companies involved.\n\nThe president's decision to resume consideration for both pipelines was described as a potential boon to construction workers, with Trump stating, \"We're going to put a lot of steel workers back to work.\" The Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to Nebraska and connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, is expected to generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes and more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP, according to TransCanada, the company that will reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nTransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha stated, \"We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL.\" The Dakota Access pipeline, which would carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois, had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in.\n\nThe moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists, who have expressed concern over the potential impact on drinking water and Native American sites. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting the decision, stating, \"These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now.\"\n\nThe pipeline orders come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration's first week in office. The president has already met with representatives from the auto industry and business and union leaders, and announced he plans to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week.\n\nThe moves on the pipelines had been widely expected, as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects. The Obama administration had stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, and the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe last year.\n\nLooking ahead, the moves on the pipelines are likely to be a significant part of Trump's energy policy, which aims to promote domestic energy production and job creation. The president has also taken steps to expedite the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and to maximize the use of U.S. steel.",
    " Title: Boehner, Obama Offer First Post-Election Olive Branch in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's election, House Speaker John A. Boehner has extended an olive branch to President Barack Obama in an effort to avert the impending \"fiscal cliff.\" The GOP leader has proposed allowing the government to collect more tax revenue, provided that Obama abandons his plan to increase tax rates on the wealthy.\n\nWith Democrats gaining ground in the Senate and maintaining control of the House, albeit with fewer numbers, Boehner's overture sets the stage for the lame-duck session of Congress, which begins next week, and for the full 113th Congress, which opens in January.\n\n\"By working together and creating a fairer, simpler, cleaner tax code, we can give our country a stronger, healthier economy,\" Boehner said. \"A stronger economy means more revenue, which is what the president seeks.\"\n\nLeaders from all sides have emphasized the need for cooperation in finding a solution to the looming tax increases and automatic spending cuts. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said he approached negotiations with an open mind and would not draw any lines in the sand.\n\nReid interpreted Tuesday's election as a mandate for raising taxes on the wealthy, a key component of Obama's campaign platform. Boehner, however, has stated that Republicans in the House will not accept increases in tax rates. Instead, his proposal relies on eliminating tax loopholes to generate more revenue, which can then be used to lower income tax rates for everyone.\n\nThe absence of Obama from the public conversation on Wednesday was notable, with Vice President Joe Biden taking his place. Biden expressed optimism about the potential for cooperation and suggested that both sides could start by addressing corporate tax rates, which all sides agree are too high and riddled with exceptions.\n\nUnless Congress takes action, the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire on January 1, and the following day, $110 billion in automatic spending cuts\u2014the result of last year's debt deal\u2014will take effect. Together, these measures would plunge the U.S. into a short but deep double-dip recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nBoth sides in Congress have expressed reservations about the magnitude of the tax increases and spending cuts, but have also acknowledged that they are too severe to implement immediately. Democrats have expanded their majority in the Senate, while the Republican majority in the House has decreased, though some seats remain undecided.\n\nIn the presidential race, Obama's popular vote and Electoral College margins have narrowed, with Florida still undecided as of Wednesday evening. However, even without Florida, Obama has secured another four years in office to pursue his election promises.\n\nBoehner has emphasized the need for spending cuts on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which consume an increasing share of government spending. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, has expressed support for the revenue deal Boehner is offering, stating that it aligns with his no-new-taxes pledge.\n\nObama ran for re-election on a platform of increasing income tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, while keeping rates low for everyone else. Republicans, however, argue that raising taxes on the wealthy amounts to a tax increase on small businesses. Boehner has pointed to discussions he had with Obama last year during the height of the debt showdown, during which they discussed a deal that would lower tax rates while closing enough loopholes to bring in more revenue.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Shows Strong Job Growth Amidst Ongoing Trade Tensions and Global Economic Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the U.S. economy added 312,000 jobs in November, according to the latest jobs report, a figure that has been met with widespread acclaim from economists. David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide, stated that the robust job growth indicates that fears of a recession are overstated.\n\nPresident Trump hailed the job growth in a televised address from the White House Rose Garden, calling the figure \"tremendous\" and noting its positive impact on the stock market. He also praised the pickup in wage growth, describing it as \"beautiful to watch.\"\n\nHowever, the strong job growth comes amidst a backdrop of economic challenges. The ongoing trade war with China, which is currently experiencing an economic downturn, could potentially dampen global demand. In the U.S., there is a slump in the housing sector, with signs that the auto industry may also be affected.\n\nThis week, Apple cut its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, stated on CNN that other U.S. companies with significant sales in China could also be impacted by tensions with Beijing.\n\nFurthermore, the Institute for Supply Management released a survey showing the biggest drop in manufacturing activity since 2008. Many manufacturers attributed the decline to rising costs related to tariffs. Despite this, the index reading of 54.1 still indicates an expanding economy. Measures of consumer confidence have also weakened recently.\n\nThe stock market has been in a significant decline since the financial crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged these concerns, stating that the Fed is \"listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending.\" However, Powell also noted that investors may be \"way ahead of the data.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. job market is showing strong growth, other economic indicators suggest a more complex and uncertain picture. The ongoing trade tensions with China and global economic conditions could potentially impact various sectors of the U.S. economy.",
    " Title: Trump Announces 2016 Presidential Campaign: A New Era of Political Satire?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, business mogul Donald Trump has reportedly announced his intention to run for the 2016 Republican Party presidential nomination. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, suggests that the announcement could be imminent, with Trump planning to release a two-page financial document detailing his $9 billion net worth following a speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nHowever, the veracity of Trump's entry into the race remains uncertain, as he has a history of using such announcements for publicity stunts. In 2012, Trump hinted at a potential presidential run, only to ultimately decline. This time around, Trump's decision to run could signal a shift in the Republican Party, with some analysts suggesting that the GOP is becoming increasingly focused on entertainment value rather than policy or governance.\n\nTrump's entry into the race has been met with mixed reactions. According to RealClearPolitics, Trump is currently polling at around 3.6 percent, placing him in the middle of the field. This is significant, as it indicates a shift in Republican voter sentiment, with a willingness to support a billionaire like Trump. However, this shift has sparked concern among political pundits, who argue that Trump's lack of political experience and his penchant for bombastic, unsubstantiated statements make him an unsuitable candidate for the highest office in the land.\n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of Trump's campaign has been his proposed plan to defeat ISIS. Trump has stated that he has a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS, but has refused to reveal the details until he is president. This has led to criticism that Trump's plan is nothing more than a campaign ploy, with no real substance behind it.\n\nIn the midst of this political drama, comedians and political writers are finding ample material for their work. Trump's flamboyant personality, his controversial statements, and his lack of political experience have made him a target for satire. As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Trump will be able to translate his celebrity status into political success, or if he will be relegated to the sidelines as a mere sideshow attraction.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: the 2016 presidential race is shaping up to be a unique and unpredictable event, with Trump's entry into the race adding a new level of intrigue and unpredictability to the political landscape. Whether Trump's campaign is a serious bid for the presidency or a publicity stunt remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the political world is watching with bated breath.",
    " Title: Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Prominent Investor Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, and Former Ministers in Anti-Corruption Crackdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Saudi Arabia announced the arrest of 11 princes, several current and former government ministers on Saturday, as reported by Al Arabiya, the Saudi state satellite TV network. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal also confirmed the news. Among those detained was Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of the royal family and a major investor in Apple and Twitter.\n\nThe arrests followed the establishment of a new anti-corruption committee by King Salman, headed by his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is now authorized to investigate, arrest, and freeze the assets of anyone suspected of corruption.\n\nHours before the arrests, King Salman had dismissed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's minister of the National Guard. Miteb, who was once considered a contender for the Saudi throne, was removed, giving Crown Prince Mohammed, who is already the Saudi defense minister, tighter control over the kingdom's security services.\n\nIt remains unclear if the arrests on Saturday are connected to the new anti-corruption committee. The royal order establishing the committee stated that it was necessary \"due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nKing Salman has been taking steps to quell dissent in the kingdom before his expected abdication in favor of Crown Prince Mohammed. Prince Miteb, who was one of the few powerful princes from outside King Salman's branch of the royal family, had been critical of the king's decision to appoint Prince Mohammed as his successor.",
    " Title: President Trump Pledges Support for Law Enforcement, Criticizes FBI Amidst Allegations of Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech to a graduating class of law enforcement officers at the FBI Academy on Friday, President Donald Trump pledged his unwavering support for the nation's law enforcement agencies. The President emphasized that he \"has your back 100 percent\" and asserted that his administration would always stand behind police.\n\nDuring the 17-minute speech, Trump acknowledged the current strained relationship between the White House and the FBI, stating, \"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI.\" He added, \"But we're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever.\"\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley claimed that newly revealed FBI records show an \"extreme bias\" against President Trump among senior leadership at the FBI, particularly during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. Gidley's comments come as special counsel Robert Mueller continues to probe possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nEdits to former FBI Director James Comey's statement on Clinton's private email server and politically charged text messages from a top agent, Peter Strzok, have raised concerns about potential bias within the FBI. Strzok, who was involved in the Clinton investigation and later assigned to Mueller's team, was re-assigned after the messages were uncovered this summer.\n\nThe FBI National Academy program, attended by approximately 200 leaders in law enforcement from around the country, aims to raise law enforcement standards and cooperation. Coursework included intelligence theory, terrorism and terrorist mindsets, law, behavioral science, law enforcement communication, and forensic science.\n\nDuring his speech, President Trump praised the agents who keep the country safe and did not blame them for the investigations that have dogged his administration. However, he did take aim at the growing violence in Baltimore and Chicago, asking, \"What the hell is going on in Chicago? What the hell is happening there?\"\n\nThe White House's allegations of bias within the FBI come as tensions between the administration and the bureau reach an all-time high. Trump has previously blasted the bureau's senior leadership and its reputation, calling it \"in tatters\" and \"the worst in history.\"",
    " Title: Texas Hospital Apologizes for Ebola Mishandling as Two Nurses Infected and Schools Close Due to Fear of Virus Spread\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in the United States, the Texas hospital where the first Ebola patient in the country died and two nurses became infected has issued an apology for mistakes made in the initial handling of the deadly virus.\n\nNina Pham, the first nurse infected, will be transferred to a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland, according to two sources familiar with the situation. She is currently being cared for in Dallas at the same hospital where she worked and where she contracted the virus from a patient she treated, Thomas Eric Duncan.\n\nDr. Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer for Texas Health Services, said in written testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the hospital made mistakes in diagnosing the symptoms of Ebola. \"We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,\" Varga said.\n\nDays after Duncan returned to the hospital, he died from the virus. However, Varga outlined a timeline of the hospital's preparation, stating that hospital staffers were given guidance on looking for Ebola symptoms several times over the summer.\n\nThe hospital has made several policy changes, such as updating the emergency department screening process to include a patient's travel history and increasing training for staffers.\n\nThe federal government is considering putting those who treated Duncan on a list that would prohibit them from being able to fly, an official familiar with the situation told CNN. The official also said the CDC is considering lowering the fever threshold that would be considered a possible sign of Ebola.\n\nThe idea came after news that Amber Vinson, a nurse who cared for Duncan, flew home from Cleveland to Dallas after reporting a fever. Vinson called the CDC to report an elevated temperature of 99.5 Fahrenheit. She informed the agency that she was getting on a plane, but was not told to stay grounded.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden said Vinson should not have flown because she helped care for Duncan, and because another health worker who cared for him had already been diagnosed with the virus. He said there's an \"extremely low\" risk to anyone else on that plane, but the agency is reaching out to everyone on the flight as part of \"extra margins of safety.\"\n\nVinson, 29, is now being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has successfully treated two other Ebola patients and has not had any employees infected. Staffing issues at the Texas hospital led to the decision to transfer Vinson to Emory, a federal official told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\nWith two of its own nurses infected with Ebola, Texas Health Presbyterian said it will allow any concerned employee to have a hospital room. \"Texas Health Dallas is offering a room to any of our impacted employees who would like to stay here to avoid even the remote possibility of any potential exposure to family, friends, and the broader public,\" the hospital said in a statement.\n\nNews of Vinson's travel on a Frontier Airlines plane led to school closures in two states. In Texas, a few schools in the Belton Independent School District are closed Thursday because two students were on the same flight as Vinson from Cleveland to Dallas - Frontier Airlines Flight 1143, the superintendent said.\n\nAnd in Ohio, two schools in the Solon School District in suburban Cleveland are closed Thursday because a staffer \"traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines Tuesday on a different flight, but perhaps the same aircraft\" as Vinson, the school district said in a statement.\n\n\"Although we believe what the science community and public health officials are telling us about the low risk of possible transmission of the virus through indirect contact, we are nonetheless taking the unusual step of closing the dual school building for Thursday so that we can have the schools cleaned and disinfected,\" the statement said.\n\nThe school districts are not the only ones concerned about Vinson's travels. Frontier Airlines placed six crew members on paid leave for 21 days \"out of an abundance of caution,\" CEO David Siegel wrote in a letter to employees. The airline also removed the plane's seat covers and carpet near where the infected passenger sat, even though it had not been asked to by the CDC, Siegel said.\n\nAfter scathing allegations by a nurses' union, a Texas Health Presbyterian spokeswoman said several of the claims were not true. National Nurses United, citing interviews with nurses at the hospital, said Duncan was \"left for several hours, not in isolation, in an area where other patients were present\" during his second visit to the hospital.\n\nHowever, hospital spokeswoman Candace White said Duncan \"was moved directly to a private room and placed in isolation\" during his second visit. And after the union claimed \"there was no one to pick up hazardous waste as it piled to the ceiling,\" White said the waste was \"well-contained in accordance with standards, and it was located in safe and containable locations.\"",
    " Title: The Unmasked Truth Behind Black Friday: A Critical Examination of America's Consumer Culture\n\nArticle:\n\nEvery year, the day after Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the holiday shopping season, a day known as Black Friday. This annual event, characterized by excessive consumerism and questionable behavior, has become a symbol of American culture, a blend of excess and indignity that remains popular despite its controversial nature.\n\nThe day following Thanksgiving is notorious for its display of American excess and indignity, a testament to our unique obsession with conspicuous consumption, fueled by credit, even in the aftermath of the Great Recession. While right-wing media figures have long lamented a supposed \"War on Christmas,\" the reality is that there is a war for Christmas, as we are still culturally obligated to purchase big-ticket items as a measure of social worth.\n\nThe collective shopping frenzy on Black Friday has reached such an uncivilized level that there are analytics predicting which states are most likely to experience fights over discounted merchandise. States with the highest rates of in-store fisticuffs during the shopping madness include Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, and Louisiana. This trend suggests that as middle- and working-class incomes decline, the pressure to keep up with the bling we are expected to own increases, leading to more Black Friday brawls.\n\nThe dynamics of Black Friday are particularly revealing. Rather than building stronger middle- and working-class incomes to afford the things we want, our politics and corporate culture have collaborated on a humiliating work-around: cheaper, disposable goods that we may have to fight for. In the past, politicians from both parties, working in conjunction with their corporate bosses, began sending American jobs overseas in pursuit of cheap labor. Back home, we are forced to take jobs for lower pay and less advancement, and the outsourced manufacturing yields relatively inexpensive products sent back to our stores.\n\nFurthermore, it has been discovered that Black Friday deals are not as good as they seem. In fact, we can often buy many items for less throughout the rest of the year. The reality of Black Friday is that we are expected to participate in a melee every year, even though the bargains are not as substantial as they appear.\n\nAdding insult to injury, lower prices are often compensated for by cutting costs elsewhere. Retailers' profit margins are diminished by these discounts, leading to a vicious cycle of cutting costs wherever possible to increase profits and sustain a fundamentally broken business model. The fallout goes beyond merely manipulating shoppers into buying stuff: it results in a loss of quality and service for consumers.\n\nAs the Black Friday effect snowballs into the future, it is clear that we will continue to fight for increasingly crappier items sold by underpaid, overworked workers both here and abroad. While there are many valid reasons for saving money in stores, it seems as though stampeding over each other and making national news for all the wrong reasons is what our system has foisted upon us. Given the reality of Black Friday, we would do well to ask ourselves and the leaders of our consumer culture whether it is seriously worth the indignity, especially given the prevalence of online retailers.\n\nSadly, for many Americans, trading self-respect for cheap crap\u2014crap that we are told we need to literally fight for\u2014has become a demeaning and ignominious holiday tradition.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Chris Christie's Statements in Fox Business Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Republican presidential debate on Fox Business Network, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched his campaign under the slogan \"telling it like it is.\" However, a review of his statements during the debate, particularly his rebuttal of Marco Rubio's attack, suggests that he may still be bending the truth with his straight talk.\n\nThe heated exchange between the two candidates erupted on the debate stage when Rubio accused Christie of holding liberal views on issues such as Common Core, gun control, the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor, and donations to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn response, Christie stated, \"Let's get the facts straight... First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.\" However, according to Politifact, in 2009, while running for New Jersey governor, Christie initially stated that Sotomayor would not have been his choice. Later that year, he issued a statement voicing support for her appointment, as reported by PolitickerNJ.\n\nChristie argued on Friday that his 2009 statements did not constitute support and that he was only calling for a straight up-or-down vote. However, in a 2009 statement, Christie wrote, \"I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.\"\n\nChristie also disputed Rubio's claims that he made a donation to Planned Parenthood. In a 1994 Newark Star-Ledger story, Christie is quoted as saying, \"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution.\" However, his camp claims he never made the donation, as Planned Parenthood does not disclose its private donors' information.\n\nRubio's allegations gave Christie an opportunity to land a memorable zinger, accusing Rubio of doing the same thing he once accused Jeb Bush of \u2013 attacking a rival just to boost his own poll numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, while Christie's statements may have been technically accurate, they do not fully reflect his past positions on certain issues, as evidenced by the 2009 statements regarding Sonia Sotomayor and Planned Parenthood.",
    " Title: Split-Screen Spectacle: Trump Rallies in Michigan as Impeachment Vote Takes Place in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented display of political drama, U.S. President Donald Trump held a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, as the House of Representatives voted on articles of impeachment in Washington D.C. on Wednesday night. The impeachment, the third in U.S. history, was sparked by a whistleblower complaint over Trump's attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and to lend credence to a Republican theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, warming up the crowd in a district represented by Rep. Justin Amash, who defected from the Republican Party earlier in the year to become an independent and voted in support of the two articles of impeachment, said Trump would wait to watch the House vote before speaking.\n\nTrump's impeachment speech was a somewhat muted performance, with the president stating that the Democrats were seeking to overturn \"the results of an election.\" He also made light of the impeachment process, referring to it as a \"political suicide march\" for the Democrats. Trump took the opportunity to boast about the strong economy, the size of his rally crowds, and a new poll showing him ahead of the Democratic nomination candidates.\n\nDespite the impeachment proceedings, Trump found time to make light of political rivals, mocking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, using the derisive nickname \"Pocahontas.\" He also made a jab at Hillary Clinton, who is rumored to be considering another presidential run, and Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who voted for impeachment.\n\nAs the House passed the two articles of impeachment, Trump was boasting about the amount of money his administration has spent on the military, including his commitment to start Space Force, a sixth branch of the armed forces. The president also took a moment to praise the USMCA trade deal before a heckler interrupted his speech. Trump responded by asking security to remove the protester and making a comment about a \"disgusting person who made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger.\"\n\nThe impeachment process is now set to move to the Senate, where a trial will be held to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. The House is expected to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate in the coming days.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Debate on Voter-ID Laws in the United States: A Look at Historical and Recent Election Fraud Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding voter-ID laws in the United States, the issue of voter fraud has taken center stage. The potential for voter fraud has been a significant factor in numerous American elections, with instances of manipulation dating back to the 1940s.\n\nOne such example is Lyndon Johnson's election to the U.S. Senate in 1948, where LBJ won by manufacturing enough fake votes to turn a 20,000-vote deficit into an 87-vote victory. Similarly, allegations of voter fraud have been raised regarding the 1960 presidential election in Illinois and Texas, casting doubt on whether Kennedy actually \"won.\" Chicago was notorious for counting the votes of deceased individuals.\n\nIn 1982, U.S. Attorney Daniel Webb uncovered at least 100,000 fraudulent votes, while in 1994, large-scale voter fraud using absentee ballots led to Democrats obtaining control of the Pennsylvania state Senate. In 2008, illegal voting played a decisive role in a U.S. Senate race, giving Al Franken a seat from Minnesota, potentially enabling the passage of Obamacare in the Senate.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed instances of voter fraud during the 2016 election cycle. In San Pedro, California, 83 absentee ballots were sent to different registered voters who all supposedly lived in the same small, two-bedroom apartment. In Pennsylvania, FieldWorks LLC, a Democratic organization, was raided for fraudulently filling out registration forms for thousands of voters.\n\nIn Indiana, state police believe there could be hundreds of fraudulent voter registration records with different combinations of made-up names and addresses with people's real information. In Chicago, an investigation by CBS Channel 2 found people who had been registered to vote after their death\u2014a total of 119 dead people who had voted 229 times. In Virginia, an examination of just eight out of the Commonwealth's 133 counties and independent cities revealed 1,046 illegal aliens had illegally registered to vote.\n\nIn New York, undercover video footage recently caught Democrats complaining about the amount of voter fraud created by New York City mayor Bill de Blasio's decision to give out ID cards without checking recipients' identities.\n\nMany argue that these problems could have been avoided if voters had to register in-person using a valid photo ID. This simple, commonsense requirement is standard in about a hundred countries around the world. Many countries' voter requirements are more stringent than anything being discussed in the United States. For instance, Mexican voters must present voter IDs that include not only a photo but also a thumbprint to help ensure people don't register more than once.\n\nMexican voter IDs carry holographic images, embedded security codes, and a magnetic strip with additional security information. As an extra precaution, multiple-voting is further prevented by dipping voters' fingers in indelible ink. Mexican voters cannot register by mail; instead, they must go to their registration office and fill out forms for their voter ID. When the voter card is ready three months later, the voter must make a second trip to pick it up from the registration office. Absentee ballots must be requested at least six months before the election.\n\nDespite these restrictive rules, people in Mexico are still able to vote, and the voter-participation rate actually increased after the 1991 reforms. The new rules gave people confidence that their votes mattered.\n\nDespite the evidence that voter-ID laws are associated with increased voting rates and have not been shown to disproportionately harm minorities, the poor, or the elderly, the fate of America's recent, limited experiment with voter-ID laws will be determined by this election. After Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia's death earlier this year, Democratic-appointee-dominated district and appeals courts around the country have had free reign in striking down voter-ID laws. Their rulings will be upheld if Hillary Clinton wins and gets to appoint Scalia's replacement, which will result in a 5-to-4 liberal majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a real cost to voter fraud. The rigging of elections undermines the government's legitimacy and discourages lawful voting. Today's election will determine whether states have any chance of solving this problem.",
    " Title: Secretary of State Kerry Seeks Expansive War Powers for Islamic State Campaign, Sparks Congressional Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Secretary of State John F. Kerry requested expansive war powers from Congress on Tuesday, stating that President Obama wants the authority to pursue the Islamic State terrorists wherever and however necessary. This move has left lawmakers stunned, as it could potentially allow for the deployment of American combat troops to the fight.\n\nDuring a hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Kerry emphasized that while Obama does not want combat troops, he does not want to be constrained by Congress should the Islamic State evolve, expand its fight to other countries, or prove more difficult to defeat. Kerry stated, \"We also don't want to hamstring the generals and the commanders in the field and the president, who's commander in chief, from their ability to be able to make some decisions they need to make.\"\n\nThe hearing, aimed at quelling a growing furor over the administration's approach, did not seem to appease lawmakers, with members from both parties criticizing the White House for appearing to delay Congressional action while doing little to take independent action. Senator Bob Corker, the ranking Republican on the committee, stated, \"The reason we're here is a total failure of the president to lead on this issue.\"\n\nSenator Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the committee, has drafted a proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that imposes a three-year limit on the authority and forbids ground combat troops in most situations, with exceptions for intelligence gathering, acting as spotters, or for rescue missions. The draft does not impose a geographic limitation.\n\nLawmakers had hoped that Obama, who won the presidency in 2008 in part due to his opposition to the Iraq War, would support strict limits. However, Kerry stated that the administration does not want such limits written into law. Menendez expressed his disappointment with the lack of cooperation from the president's team, stating, \"It sounds to me like you're making the case for a rather open-ended authorization.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing debate, the Senate is expected to vote on the war resolution on Thursday, with a potential chamber-wide vote next week. House Speaker John A. Boehner has stated that his chamber will take up the war debate next year, with the president responsible for proposing a resolution and making a case to the American people.\n\nThe rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has been a source of embarrassment for the president, who, a year ago, declared al Qaeda on the run and said it was time to begin winding down the war on terror. Kerry made it clear during Tuesday's hearing that the administration considers the Islamic State, which has captured large swaths of Syria and Iraq, to be a branch of al Qaeda operating under a different name. This means that Obama already has powers to go after them under the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, even if Congress does not act.\n\nKerry also disputed lawmakers who labeled the fight against the Islamic State as a \"war,\" stating that it will be dramatically different than the U.S.'s previous decade-long engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama has already committed thousands of troops to Iraq in a supporting role, backing that country's troops, and the U.S. has conducted airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria to halt Islamic State advances.\n\nMeanwhile, a defense policy bill about to clear Congress authorizes the president to arm and train Syrian rebel groups for the next two years, with the hope that those rebels will take the fight to the Islamic State inside Syria. Senators did credit Kerry and Obama with pushing Iraq's politicians to push for political unity, which has helped solidify much of the country in opposition to the Islamic State. However, Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, criticized Kerry for being too timid in pursuing the Islamic State, calling Tuesday's hearing a \"charade.\"",
    " Title: The Political Battle Over Deficit Reduction and Sequestration: A Look Back at the Budget Control Act of 2011\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, set to take effect on March 1, have sparked a contentious political battle over deficit reduction. To understand the current standoff, it is essential to revisit the voting history of the Budget Control Act of 2011, a bill designed to reduce the deficit and prevent default.\n\nThe act established a supercommittee on deficit control, with the provision that if the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement, automatic spending cuts would be imposed on all discretionary spending, including the military. The expiration of various tax cuts would also result in tax increases for millions of Americans.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2011, an overwhelming majority of Republicans (174-66) in the House voted for the bill. House Democrats split down the middle, with 95-95 votes. Republican leaders John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Kevin McCarthy voted yes, while Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn also voted yes. The bill passed the Senate the following day, with 45 Senate Democrats supporting the bill, joined by 28 Republicans and one Independent.\n\nPresident Obama signed the bill, a bicameral, bipartisan effort in cooperation with the White House, into law. However, in the October 22, 2012, presidential debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama denied any involvement in the sequester, stating, \"The sequester is not something that I proposed. It's something that Congress has proposed.\"\n\nThis statement was a key moment in the final debate, which was generally scored in favor of the president. It could have gone the other way if Romney had known that sequestration would also lead to a spike in unemployment, up to 9.1 percent by the end of 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which released the report just a little more than 24 hours after Romney conceded the election.\n\nIn his book \"The Price of Politics,\" Bob Woodward traced the sequester idea as a negotiating strategy that originated in the executive office, moved through the Democratic leader of the Senate, and was eventually adopted by Republican leaders. The supercommittee could not agree, and the automatic spending cuts of sequestration are now imminent.\n\nAs a member of the 112th Congress, some representatives voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011. They argue that while there is waste in government, spending cuts should focus on wars, interventions, and foreign aid that may lead to interventions. They believe the U.S. should address its $600 billion trade deficit and focus on domestic issues.\n\nWith automatic spending cuts looming, the president will continue to distance himself from the sequestration process, while Republicans will attempt to portray him as the initiator. The Democrats will attack Republicans for sequestration, with Minority Whip Steny Hoyer already going into high gear in an attack mode.\n\nAs the political battle over deficit reduction and sequestration continues, both parties grapple with each other, potentially precipitating one crisis too many for an American electorate concerned about the economy.",
    " Title: Trump Leads Republican Presidential Field by 11 Points in Latest National Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest national poll on the 2016 Republican presidential field, businessman Donald Trump has taken an 11-point lead over his closest rival. According to the Washington Post-ABC poll released on Monday, Trump is the first choice of 24 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.\n\nTrump's closest competitor is Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who follows with 13 percent, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who is at 12 percent. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is next with 8 percent, followed by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at 7 percent, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at 6 percent each.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Texas Governor Rick Perry are at 4 percent each, while New Jersey Governor Chris Christie rounds out the top 10 with 3 percent.\n\nTrump's poll numbers have significantly increased since the Post-ABC poll released in late May, where he was at 4 percent. In that survey, Mr. Walker and Sen. Paul were tied for first at 11 percent, followed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio at 10 percent each, Mr. Huckabee at 9 percent, and Mr. Carson and Mr. Cruz at 8 percent each.\n\nIn response to the survey, Trump's campaign released a statement from him, stating, \"People are tired of incompetent leaders and being pushed around at will by other nations, our enemies, and even our friends. Politicians have completely failed the American people. We owe $18 trillion dollars, have porous and dangerous borders, and can't even take proper care of our magnificent Veterans. If I become president, I will do what I do best \u2014 fix these problems and Make America Great Again!\"\n\nTrump has faced criticism over recent comments he's made about Mexico and illegal immigrants, as well as the military service of Sen. John McCain of Arizona. However, Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, downplayed any potential drop in support following the backlash, stating that 8 percent of the poll was conducted on Sunday and calling it a \"statistical error.\"\n\nThe overall survey of 1,002 adults was taken from July 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: House Transmits Articles of Impeachment to Senate as Democrats and Republicans Prepare for Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the House of Representatives is set to vote Wednesday on a resolution to transmit the two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate, marking the start of a trial that is all but guaranteed to result in an acquittal for the President. The move comes after a nearly four-week delay, during which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to dictate rules for the trial.\n\nThe Senate is expected to begin the trial on Tuesday with a standard set of rules preferred by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with Democrats hoping to put pressure on Senate Republicans, particularly those from swing states facing reelection in November, to back demands for additional witness testimony at the trial.\n\nHowever, the prevailing wisdom on Capitol Hill is that impeachment as an election issue will backfire on Pelosi and her Democrats, who won the majority in 2018 by picking up seats in traditionally Republican strongholds.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has been criticized by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for demanding a decision on witnesses in pretrial negotiations. McConnell pointed to what he called a \"revealing admission\" from Schumer that the debate over witness testimony was a play to pick up seats in November.\n\n\"The Senate Democratic leader recently said that as long as he can try to use the trial process to hurt some Republicans' reelection chances, 'It's a win-win.' That's what this is all about,\" he said.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders insist their side is winning the impeachment debate, with Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries stating, \"We'll see what happens in the Senate, but I think there's been substantial movement. That's a good thing.\"\n\nSenate Democrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to get the 51 votes needed to call a witness. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado are two moderate Republicans up for re-election who have expressed a willingness to consider calling witnesses. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are two more Republicans who have not closed the door to hearing from more witnesses.\n\nThe House Democrats' impeachment managers are expected to be named Wednesday, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York at the top of the list of likely managers. The House impeached Trump in a party-line vote on December 18, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe trial is expected to be a closely watched event, with many Americans expressing an interest in hearing from key witnesses such as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The outcome of the trial is likely to have significant implications for the 2020 election and the future of the presidency.",
    " Title: The Campus Creed: A New Era of Politics in the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate, in the midst of the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, has adopted the values and norms of the modern university, with the polarizing atmosphere of college campuses now permeating Congress. The hearings, marked by self-censorship, no-go zones, and safe spaces, have raised concerns about the asymmetry in the treatment of witnesses and the shifting standards of truth.\n\nAmericans may have differing opinions regarding the credibility of Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. However, the hearings demonstrated a clear asymmetry in the treatment of the two parties. Ford's veracity hinged on empathy and perceived believability, with little requirement for corroborating testimonies, witnesses, or physical evidence. In contrast, Kavanaugh was considered guilty from the start, and had to prove his innocence.\n\nThe university's postmodern idea of relativist truth, where all narratives are considered equally valid, has seeped into the Senate. This concept, which privileges one story over another based on self-interest rather than evidence and facts, has led to the emergence of self-described victims who are under no obligation to play by what they consider to be rigged rules of facts, evidence, or testimony.\n\nSenator Cory Booker (D-NJ) exemplified this when he insisted that Dr. Ford told \"her truth.\" In other words, evidence was not so relevant. Ford's story of events from 36 years ago inherently would have as much claim on reality as Kavanaugh's rebuttal\u2014and perhaps more so, given their different genders and asymmetrical access to power.\n\nThe search for \"the Truth\" was largely abandoned, as it would have required the messy work of taxing the memories of teenage behavior nearly four decades prior. Truth-finding would have required difficult, time-honored examinations of physical evidence, the testimony of witnesses, and even unpleasant cross-examinations about the time and place of the allegations.\n\nThe race and gender of people now increasingly determine who we are, with Republican senators being written off as \"old white men,\" not unique individuals who might be disinterested or biased, fair or prejudicial. Kavanaugh was largely assumed guilty, in part for once being a privileged white kid of 17 who had gone to a prep school.\n\nMeanwhile, Booker, by virtue of not being old and white, was considered a credible senatorial examiner. No one cared that Booker had once invented stories about an imaginary friend named \"T-Bone.\"\n\nSuch blanket race- and age-based stereotyping was not even consistent. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) is 72 and white. Yet given his progressive politics, no one dismissed him on the basis of gender and age, much less for being a serial fabricator who concocted false stories of being a Vietnam veteran.\n\nThe Senate also adopted the modern university's doctrine of self-censorship, no-go zones, and safe spaces. Given issues of gender and the university concept that accusations of sexual assault inherently are exempt from constitutional protections of due process, Ford was more or less excused from normally tough cross-examination.\n\nIn her testimony, Ford never explained why, despite her self-professed fear of flying, she has been a frequent flyer on business and leisure trips. Ford's privacy and medical status were understandably to be respected and off-limits. Yet Ford suggested that her friend, Leland Ingham Keyser, was suffering from \"significant health challenges\" after Keyser did not corroborate Ford's allegations.\n\nFord was never really asked why her narratives concerning the number of witnesses to the alleged assault and their genders were not compatible. Her accounts of the location and time of the alleged assault were either inconsistent or nonexistent. In contrast, Kavanagh was grilled on everything from his high-school yearbook to a made-up accusation that he once committed sexual assault on a docked boat in Newport, RI.\n\nSwarming and shouting down those who hold different views in order to shame and intimidate them is part and parcel of the modern university. Now, we are seeing such campus street theater in Congress. During a break in the hearings, female protesters cornered Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in an elevator and screamed in his face.\n\nThe psychodrama worked\u2014just as it usually does on campus. A shaken and flushed Flake soon backed down from his stated intention of voting to confirm Kavanaugh.\n\nCampuses are no longer out-of-touch ivory towers. Their creed is now beginning to run the country, which is frightening.",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Announces Retirement, Sparking Speculation and Reflection Among Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan announced on Wednesday that he will retire from Congress at the end of this year, marking the close of a two-decade political career. The announcement has ignited introspection within the Republican Party, which is bracing for a challenging election season.\n\nRyan dismissed speculations that he was abandoning a sinking ship, expressing confidence that the Republicans will maintain their House majority in November's elections. He pledged to remain active as a lame-duck speaker, pushing for spending controls and the rest of the Republican agenda during his remaining term.\n\nThe speaker's decision was primarily driven by family considerations, as he has three teenage children and wants to be more present in their lives. \"If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad,\" he said. \"I just can't let that happen.\"\n\nThe announcement set off a scramble among Republicans to fill Ryan's position. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana are seen as the most likely contenders for the post. Some lawmakers and conservative groups have urged a cautious approach in choosing the next leader, particularly since the Republicans' position will not be clear until after the November elections.\n\nRyan's tenure as speaker, spanning about 2\u00bd turbulent years, has been marked by facing down conservative rebellions, securing a large tax cut, but failing to repeal Obamacare or reach a deal on immigration. He considered his major accomplishments to be the tax cuts and last month's omnibus spending bill, which included a significant increase in Pentagon funding and a substantial boost in domestic funding.\n\nHis biggest regret, he said, was failing to secure changes to big social spending programs, although he noted that the House, under his leadership, had passed \"the biggest entitlement reform bill ever considered in the House of Representatives.\"\n\nRyan, the Republican Party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, indicated that he is finished with elected politics for the immediate future, and potentially for good. After serving as a critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, he became the president's most effective ally on Capitol Hill by helping to advance the White House agenda.\n\nDemocrats expressed hope that Ryan, now free from the need to face voters, would turn against Trump and sideline conservative lawmakers who have resisted more liberal-leaning deals. However, Ryan's relationship with conservatives as speaker has been strained at times, with concerns about spending and a perceived lack of input from the rank and file.\n\nConservative members generally praised Ryan for his efforts in securing the tax cut, but they called for the next speaker to be willing to fight for real spending cuts and a return to regular order. The status quo of the Republican Party is not sustainable, according to Adam Brandon, president of the conservative activist group FreedomWorks. The next speaker must work with conservatives \"to make the GOP the party of free markets and limited government again.\"\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, did not necessarily see the next speaker coming from the caucus, but he emphasized the importance of the Freedom Caucus having a voice in leadership decisions and the agenda.\n\nConservative members generally praised Ryan for his approach to the job and for helping win tax cuts last year. They acknowledged that there were disagreements but appreciated Ryan's openness to conversation. However, they left a more comprehensive examination of Ryan's record for a later time.\n\nRep. Walter B. Jones, North Carolina Republican, criticized the tax bill for not being paid for and noted that independent budget watchdogs have estimated it could add as much as $2 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. He also expressed doubt that Congress would accomplish much for the rest of the year, regardless of Ryan's announcement.\n\nIn conclusion, Ryan's retirement has set off a flurry of activity within the Republican Party, with jockeying for position to replace him and introspection about his legacy and the direction of the party. Ryan's decision to retire, while surprising, is a testament to his commitment to his family and his desire to step away from politics to spend more time with them. The next few months will be crucial for the Republican Party as they navigate the election season and choose a new leader.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Accuses Romney of Misrepresenting Tenure at Bain Capital, Romney Denies Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange of allegations, the Obama campaign on Wednesday accused Mitt Romney of either lying to federal regulators or to voters about the length of his tenure at private equity firm Bain Capital. The Romney campaign, in response, labeled the accusation as an \"over-the-top\" attack that warrants an apology from the Obama team.\n\nThe controversy, which has been brewing since the Republican primary, was sparked by a report in the Boston Globe that suggested documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Romney may have led Bain until 2002, three years longer than he claims. This allegation is significant as it implies Romney's responsibility for investments Bain made between 1999 and 2002, which reportedly led to jobs being outsourced to China and India.\n\nStephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for the Obama campaign, stated in a conference call that if Romney was lying to the American people about his position at Bain, it raises serious character and trust issues. The Romney camp, however, dismissed the Globe report as inaccurate and pointed to independent fact checkers that agreed with their stance.\n\nRomney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, labeled the Obama team's accusations as \"reckless and unsubstantiated,\" and called for an apology from the president for the behavior of his staff. Bain Capital also released a statement supporting Romney's claim that he left in 1999 and had no involvement with the firm since his departure.\n\nThe controversy has led to demands for Romney to release more tax returns to provide voters with a clearer picture of his finances. Democrats argue that Romney's role at Bain is crucial for voters to understand his approach to job creation.\n\nDavid Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois, stated that Romney's complex finances make this a challenging story to control. He added that the Romney camp deserves blame for not having better answers ready, given their years of running for the presidency.\n\nThe back-and-forth between the two campaigns continued with both sides releasing ads and counter-reports. The Romney campaign released an ad titled \"No Evidence,\" accusing Obama of lying about Romney's role in offshoring jobs, while the Obama campaign highlighted the Globe report that suggested Romney was in \"full control of Bain Capital through 2002.\"\n\nThe controversy is expected to continue as both campaigns seek to present their respective candidates in the most favorable light.",
    " Title: Poll Shows Tight Race Between Obama and Romney in Virginia, Suggesting Shift in Electoral Map\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll by Quinnipiac University, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney are tied in the swing state of Virginia, with both candidates receiving 44 percent of the vote. The poll, conducted from July 10-16, surveyed 1,673 registered voters and has a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points.\n\nThe poll shows a significant shift in the state's political landscape, as Virginia provided President Obama with one of his biggest victories in 2008, supporting a Democratic candidate for the first time in more than four decades. In March, Mr. Obama enjoyed a 50 percent to 42 percent advantage over Mr. Romney.\n\nIndependent voters in the state currently lean slightly towards the president, with 40 percent supporting Mr. Obama and 38 percent backing Mr. Romney. However, Mr. Obama's advantage with women has decreased from 16 points in March to 5 points in July.\n\nThe poll also indicates that both candidates are facing a lack of enthusiasm from voters, with Mr. Obama's favorability ratings underwater for the first time since December, with 46 percent holding a favorable opinion of him and 48 percent an unfavorable one. Mr. Romney's favorability ratings are also negative, with a 39-42 favorable-unfavorable split.\n\nPeter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, commented, \"One of them is going to win the White House, but neither would get elected Prom King.\"\n\nThe tight race in Virginia could indicate a shift in the electoral map this year, with the race potentially resembling the 2004 election, where an under-fire incumbent, President George W. Bush, fended off a challenger, Sen. John F. Kerry, who was not particularly popular.\n\nIf Mr. Obama holds on to the states he won in 2008, which now have 246 electoral votes, Virginia's 13 votes could clinch re-election for Mr. Obama even if he loses the other key swing states - Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina. Because New Mexico is trending towards Mr. Obama, the president could reach the required 270 electoral votes by winning just one of the three other states he flipped in 2008 - Nevada, Colorado, or Iowa.\n\nPaul Goldman, a longtime Democratic strategist, stated, \"The president doesn't have to win Virginia to get elected, but there's a good chance Romney does.\"\n\nNPR also released a poll that gives Mr. Obama a 47 percent to 45 percent lead, within the margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. However, voters in 12 battleground states, which included Virginia, were split, with 46 percent favoring Mr. Obama, 46 percent favoring Mr. Romney, and 3 percent undecided.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted from July 9-12 and had an oversample to reach 462 voters in the battlegrounds. That sample had a margin of error of 4.56 percentage points.\n\nOther recent polls also suggest a close race nationally, with Mr. Romney leading 47 percent to 46 percent in a CBS/New York Times poll, and Mr. Obama leading 45 percent to 41 percent in a Fox poll.\n\nThe new numbers were released as first lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to visit Virginia on Friday to launch a voter outreach program the campaign plans to take to other battleground states next week.\n\nThe poll results come after Mr. Romney's campaign used President Obama's \"If you've got a business, you didn't build that\" remark as a rallying cry, arguing that Mr. Obama does not understand or care for the free enterprise system. The Obama campaign responded with its own online ad, titled \"Mitt Romney: Saying Anything to Get Elected,\" which splices recent remarks from Mr. Romney with Mr. Obama's comments to argue that the challenger was essentially agreeing with the president's larger point.",
    " Title: Republican Rep. Mark Sanford Loses Primary Amidst Trump Criticism; Corey Stewart Wins Virginia GOP Senate Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of primary elections held on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina became the latest casualty in the ongoing saga of political allegiance to President Donald Trump. Sanford, who has been critical of the President, lost his primary race to state Rep. Katie Arrington.\n\nThe theme of the day's elections, which also saw voting in Virginia, Maine, Nevada, and North Dakota, was the unprecedented success of female candidates in Democratic primaries. In Virginia, three women - Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton - won their Democratic primaries, further demonstrating the party's reliance on women to unseat vulnerable Republicans in the Trump era.\n\nIn the Republican primary in South Carolina, Arrington's campaign was based on Sanford's perceived insufficient support for Trump. The same factor played a role in Alabama Rep. Martha Roby's runoff, where she was criticized for her comments following the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in 2016.\n\nTrump himself weighed in on the South Carolina race less than three hours before the polls closed, tweeting, \"Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!\"\n\nSanford's personal scandal, stemming from his disappearance to Argentina during an extramarital affair in 2009, loomed large in the race. Both Trump and Arrington mocked Sanford's initial excuse, that he'd been \"hiking the Appalachian Trail.\" In an ad, Arrington urged voters to tell Sanford to \"take a hike.\"\n\nIn another significant development, Corey Stewart, the bombastic conservative who built his public image on championing the Confederate flag and monuments like Charlottesville's Robert E. Lee statue and has appeared with white nationalists, won the Republican Senate nomination in Virginia. State and national Republicans have expressed concern that Stewart's presence on the ballot could lead Republican voters to stay at home, hurting the party in several competitive House races.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Caleb Frostman, the Democrat running in Wisconsin State Senate District 1, claimed victory in Tuesday's special election, marking the 43rd red-to-blue flip since Trump stepped into the White House last year. However, Ann Groves Lloyd, the Democrat running in the special election in Wisconsin State Assembly District 42, conceded to her Republican opponent.\n\nIn the North Dakota and Nevada primaries, Rep. Kevin Cramer was chosen to challenge Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, while Nevada Democrats picked Rep. Jacky Rosen as their nominee against Sen. Dean Heller. The two primaries were relatively quiet, but will be among the nation's most important battlegrounds in November.\n\nThe Maine House District and the Democrat or Republican primary for Maine governor are still too close to call, with CNN yet to project a winner. The race for Maine governor saw Sen. Angus King's opponent run unopposed for the Republican nomination, with a saucy video of the candidate circulating online.\n\nThe elections on Tuesday further underscored the importance of political alignment with Trump in the Republican Party, as well as the significant role of women in the Democratic Party's efforts to regain control of the House.",
    " Title: Romney Addresses NAACP, Criticizes Obama Administration's Performance for African-Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered at the NAACP annual convention in Houston on Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney faced a cool reception from the audience as he criticized the Obama administration's handling of economic and educational issues affecting African-Americans.\n\nRomney, the former Massachusetts governor, questioned the historical loyalty of the black community to the Democratic Party, suggesting that the same promises have produced the same failures. He emphasized his support for charter schools and vouchers, a stance similar to that of the Obama administration, and attempted to distance himself from the notion that his campaign is about helping the wealthy.\n\nThe audience's reaction was mixed, with sustained booing after Romney's mention of his intention to eliminate \"Obamacare\" if elected. Romney did not address the issue of voter ID laws, a contentious topic in the ongoing debate about conservative efforts to suppress the nonwhite vote.\n\nRomney's speech included a critique of the current 14.4 percent unemployment rate in the black community, suggesting, albeit indirectly, that President Obama's administration has failed African-Americans. He also highlighted his late father, Michigan Governor George Romney, and closed with a religious note, quoting the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nRomney's speech also touched on his opposition to same-sex marriage, a stance that contrasts with the NAACP's and President Obama's endorsement of the issue. He also emphasized his jobs message, including his aim to reduce government spending by eliminating \"expensive nonessential programs like Obamacare.\"\n\nPeeling off African-American voters, who overwhelmingly voted for Obama in 2008, has been a long-shot for Republicans, even without an African-American incumbent in the White House. In a statement after the speech, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous criticized Romney's stance on the Affordable Care Act, stating that it \"signals his fundamental misunderstanding of the needs of many African Americans.\"\n\nNAACP Chairman Roslyn M. Brock, however, praised Romney for his courage in addressing the audience directly. Romney left the stage to a smattering of polite applause.",
    " Title: Historic Blizzard Impacts Millions Across Eastern U.S., Causing Massive Disruptions and Dangerous Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nA historic blizzard, expected to affect more than 70 million people, began blanketing the nation's capital with snow on Friday, prompting widespread closures, cancellations, and safety concerns. The storm, which is predicted to be one of the top three snowfalls of all time for Washington, D.C., has already caused significant disruptions and dangerous conditions across several states.\n\nOfficials in Washington, D.C., have urged government workers to leave early and have warned that the Metro subway system will shut down entirely late Friday night and remain closed through Sunday. Underground stations are usually kept open during major snowstorms, but the severity of this storm necessitates extraordinary measures for the safety of workers and riders.\n\nAir travel has been severely impacted, with more than 2,900 flights canceled for Friday, primarily in Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, and thousands more delayed. For Saturday, over 3,300 flights have been canceled, including all flights into and out of Philadelphia International Airport. Major airlines have issued waivers for travel over the weekend, allowing passengers to rebook onto earlier or later flights to avoid the storms.\n\nThe storm is expected to hit areas around the nation's capital the hardest, with Washington, D.C., forecasted to receive more than 2 feet of snow. Philadelphia could get 12 to 18 inches, and New York 8 to 10 inches, although some forecasts suggest even more. Train service could be disrupted by frozen switches, the loss of third-rail electric power, or trees falling on wires. Across the region, track workers, power company employees, road crew members, firefighters, and other first responders have been mobilized for the long weekend.\n\nConditions quickly became treacherous as the storm moved northeast. Arkansas and Tennessee received eight inches, Kentucky got more than a foot, and states across the Deep South grappled with icy, snow-covered roads and power outages. At least eight people have died in traffic fatalities in the dangerous weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings stretching from northern Virginia to parts of New York's Long Island, where the U.S. Coast Guard has warned of seas that could swell up to 18 feet. The blizzard warnings are scheduled to last until early Sunday.\n\nGovernors in several states, including New Jersey and Maryland, have declared states of emergency, urging residents to stay home and avoid travel. Forecasters have also warned of \"thundersnow,\" a dangerous type of thunderstorm that drops snow instead of rain.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic region is notorious for struggling to cope with winter weather, and a light dusting on Wednesday night served as an ominous prelude to the massive blizzard. Even the start of the snowstorm could not keep some tourists from visiting the White House, with several groups and couples walking in the park in front of the mansion and the fountain in the home's yard still spraying water.\n\nAs the storm continues to move northeast, officials and meteorologists warn of the potential for significant damage and disruptions. The National Weather Service's Director, Louis Uccellini, has warned that the snowfall could easily cause more than $1 billion in damage and paralyze the Eastern third of the nation.",
    " Title: Trump's Syria Strike: A Shift in Policy and a Divide Among Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent missile strike launched by the United States against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has caused a significant shift in policy and sparked a divide among President Donald Trump's supporters, particularly on the far-right fringe.\n\nInitially, Trump had pledged to keep Syria out of U.S. military engagements, a stance that resonated with his isolationist base. However, the chemical weapons attack in Syria, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of children and emergency workers, prompted Trump to condemn Assad. This move, in turn, led to a U.S. missile strike against Syrian targets.\n\nThe swift change in policy has left many of Trump's far-right supporters, who had previously criticized former President Barack Obama for suggesting military action against the Syrian regime, perplexed. The U.S. priority, as stated by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, is no longer focused on removing Assad, but rather on addressing the use of chemical weapons.\n\nThe alt-right, reassured by the presence of America-Firsters like Steve Bannon in the White House, had initially believed that Trump would adhere to their isolationist views. However, Trump's actions seem to align more with the pro-war sentiments prevalent in elite circles, a shift that has disappointed the alt-right.\n\nSome of Trump's fringe supporters, such as alt-right agitator Mike Cernovich, have suggested that the chemical attack was a \"false flag\" operation orchestrated by deep state agents. Infowars, run by extreme conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, has gone as far as blaming the attack on Democrat billionaire George Soros.\n\nAnn Coulter, once a high priestess of Trumpism, has criticized Trump for abandoning his campaign principles, implying that he was swayed by emotional television footage. Breitbart, a news outlet with close ties to the alt-right, has expressed disapproval, with its front page hinting at discontent and Breitbart London's editor-in-chief, Raheem Kassam, spending his radio show criticizing the Trump administration.\n\nInterestingly, the missile strike occurred hours after Bannon, a de facto representative of the alt-right in the White House, was removed from the National Security Council Principals Committee, limiting his access to military decision-making. Bannon's supporters have quickly attributed the Syria situation to the same individuals they believe are responsible for his diminishing stature in the White House: Jared Kushner and the \"West Wing Democrats.\"\n\nThis divide among Trump's supporters underscores the complexities of policy-making and the challenges faced by the Trump administration in balancing competing interests and maintaining unity within its base.",
    " Title: HUD Proposes Rent Increase for Millions of Public Housing Residents, Sparking Debate Over Affordable Housing Support\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson has unveiled a proposal that would increase rent for millions of families living in federally subsidized public housing. The proposal, titled the Make Affordable Housing Work Act, would raise the rent paid by public housing residents to 35 percent from 30 percent of household income, and eliminate all deductions that could lower that number.\n\nThe proposal, which would need to be approved by Congress, could ignite a debate over the best ways to support some of the country's poorest and most vulnerable families. Democrats are expected to offer strong opposition, and some members of the Republican majority may be hesitant to endorse the plan ahead of the midterm elections in the fall.\n\nUnder the new plan, rents would be reassessed every three years instead of annually. Elderly and disabled tenants, who make up more than half of the 4.7 million public housing families, would be exempted.\n\nCarson argued that the changes are necessary to bring more money into the system and modernize an outdated model. \"The way we calculate the level of assistance to our families is archaic and has perverse consequences, like discouraging these residents from earning more income,\" Carson said in an interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"It's clear from a budget perspective and from a human standpoint that this is not sustainable.\"\n\nTenants' rights advocates, however, are already expressing concern. Jack Cooper, executive director of the Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants, called the proposal \"a war on low-income people.\" Cooper, who understands Carson's perspective as a self-made individual who grew up in poverty, believes the proposal will force families into homelessness rather than encourage greater self-sufficiency.\n\n\"We're talking about keeping a roof over people who can't afford the market,\" Cooper said. \"They're devastating folks that are already in dire straits.\" The average annual income for public housing residents is $12,000, and many families may struggle to meet the additional expenses under the new plan.",
    " Title: Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss Breaks with Grover Norquist, Embraces Tax Increases to Address U.S. Budget Deficit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the long-held stance of many Republican lawmakers, Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) has distanced himself from the anti-tax pledge championed by activist Grover Norquist. In an interview with Georgia television station WMAZ, a CNN affiliate, on Wednesday, Chambliss stated, \"I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge.\"\n\nThe U.S. Congress is currently facing a year-end deadline to address the ballooning U.S. budget deficit, with the potential for a fiscal cliff of mandatory tax increases and spending cuts that experts warn could push the country back into recession. The budget standoff centers on disagreements over how to generate new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Senate Democrats advocate for increasing tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, while House Republicans, who control the majority in that chamber, favor alternative methods for generating income, such as closing tax loopholes and eliminating deductions.\n\nNorquist, who heads the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, has been successful in persuading a strong majority of congressional Republicans to sign his pledge to not raise taxes. However, earlier this year, a small number of freshman lawmakers rejected the notion that they were bound to the document.\n\nAccording to the Americans for Tax Reform website, Chambliss, along with 38 other senators and 219 House members entering the next Congress, have signed the pledge. Yet, Chambliss, who has previously criticized Norquist's influence on anti-tax sentiments, stated this week that Norquist's ideas are obstructing the search for a solution to the mounting debt.\n\n\"Norquist has no plan to pay this debt down,\" said Chambliss, who is up for re-election in 2014. The anti-tax crusader has stated he predicts congressional Republicans will stand firm and negotiate a deal that excludes tax hikes.\n\nWhen asked if Chambliss is concerned Norquist may use his resources to challenge a re-election bid, the senator replied, \"In all likelihood, yes.\" However, he added, \"But I do not worry about that because I care too much about my country.\"\n\nChambliss concluded, \"I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist.\" The two-term senator from Georgia added he is \"willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves.\"",
    " Title: Republican Candidates Face Funding Uncertainty as Close Races in Ohio and Kansas Raise Alarms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Republican candidates backed by President Donald Trump narrowly lead in closely watched races in Ohio and Kansas, concerns are growing within the Republican party about their ability to continue providing millions of dollars in aid to candidates for the November mid-term Congressional elections.\n\nIn Ohio's 12th congressional district, Republican Troy Balderson may have eked out a victory in a special election for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, but he leads Democrat Danny O'Connor by only about 1,700 votes or less than 1.0 percent. The final result could be days away as state officials count more than 8,000 provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nIn the Kansas primary to select a Republican candidate for the November mid-term U.S. elections, Kris Kobach is clinging to a 191-vote lead over his Republican primary opponent, current Governor Jeff Colyer, with potentially thousands more provisional and absentee ballots outstanding.\n\nThe close margins in both races have raised concerns about the Republican party's ability to fund all at-risk candidates in November, with Democrats already raising more money in many seats. Joe Brettell, a Texas-based Republican strategist, stated, \"After last night's results, endangered members should be burning up the phone lines to donors - either to build their own fundraising or look for a job. The party won't be able to save everyone.\"\n\nIn November, all 435 U.S. House members and one-third of the Senate stand for reelection. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to take control of the House, and there are dozens of seats currently held by Republicans with larger Democratic populations than the Ohio district.\n\nCorry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC that supported Balderson in Ohio, stated, \"Any Republican running for Congress getting vastly outraised by an opponent needs to start raising more money.\" Bliss's group, as of mid-July, had raised $96.6 million and had $73.3 million in remaining cash.\n\nRepublicans hope Balderson's narrow win on election night will jolt the field out of complacency. The biggest unknown is how much cash remains for Republicans to tap. Casino executive Sheldon Adelson, a large donor, has already contributed $30 million to help Republicans, but the network of donors managed by Charles and David Koch has gone in the opposite direction, warning Republicans they may not support their candidates in large part because of Trump's protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn Democratic circles, the Ohio results were cast as a win, even if their candidate was not victorious. David Pepper, chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, stated, \"He [Balderson] should be running scared this fall. He's not going to have Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and all that money bailing him out.\"\n\nBoth races left unanswered questions about whether Trump will be able to lift endangered members to victory, regardless of how much cash they have. Trump took credit for Balderson's lead, writing on Twitter that the campaign took \"a big turn for the better\" after he appeared in the district on Saturday. However, Pepper noted that Trump's presence energizes Democrats as well, adding that \"if he thinks that finish in this district is a good result, all power to him.\"\n\nThe Ohio race mirrored other special federal elections over the past 12 months, including upsets by Democrat Conor Lamb in a Pennsylvania congressional race in March and by Democrat Doug Jones over Roy Moore for an Alabama Senate seat in December of last year. Trump stumped for both candidates in losing efforts. In those races, rural voters favored Trump-supported candidates, but turnout in those regions lagged heavy suburban turnout, where Democrats expanded on margins won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nKobach had hoped to ride his ties to Trump to victory after the president endorsed him in a tweet, but even as Kobach sought to declare himself the virtual winner on Wednesday, he acknowledged he could still lose, and a protracted recount could aid Democrats. Kansas state law allows for a recount if the vote margin is within half a percentage point, but the candidate has to request the recount. The candidate who requests the recount must pay for it if the results are unchanged by that process, Kobach said.",
    " Title: White House Clarifies President Trump's Stance on Extremist Groups, Condemns White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a clarification issued on Sunday, a White House spokesman stated that President Donald Trump has explicitly condemned all extremist groups, including white supremacists and neo-Nazis. The statement comes in response to criticism that the President's initial response to the violent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, was not forceful enough in condemning white supremacist groups.\n\nThe White House spokesman said, \"The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, the KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Trump's response to the Charlottesville rally was widely criticized for not specifically calling out and condemning white supremacist groups. Among the critics was former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who told ABC News that Trump should have been much harsher.\n\n\"I wouldn't have recommended that statement,\" Scaramucci said in response to Trump's Saturday statement from New Jersey. \"I think he would have needed to have been much harsher.\"\n\nWhile in New Jersey, Trump described the Charlottesville rally as an \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.\" For many political observers, the President's response was not aggressive enough, given that a member of the alt-right allegedly drove a car through a group of antifa protesters, resulting in one death and at least 19 injuries.\n\n\"With the moral authority of the presidency, you have to call that stuff out,\" Scaramucci added.\n\nOther Republicans also expressed their opinions on Trump's statement. GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said on Twitter, \"We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Cory Gardner urged Trump to declare the incident an act of terror. \"Mr. President \u2013 we must call evil by its name,\" Gardner said. \"These were white supremacists, and this was domestic terrorism.\"",

However, these worries are not centered on media accuracy, but rather on the potential impact of Mueller's statement on the media's credibility.\n\nJeffrey Toobin, a senior CNN analyst and writer for The New Yorker, expressed his concerns on-air following Mueller's announcement. \"I have a different view of the implications of all this,\" Toobin told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"My view is the larger message that a lot of people are going to take from this story is that the news media are a bunch of leftist liars who are dying to get the president, and they're willing to lie to do it.\"\n\nToobin added, \"I just think this is a bad day for us.\"\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo also observed that \"Mueller did not do the media any favors.\"\n\n\"And he did do the president one, because as you saw with Rudy Giuliani and as I'm sure you'll see with the president himself, this allows them to say, 'You can't believe it. You can't believe what you read, you can't believe what you hear, you can only believe us.' Even the special counsel says that the media doesn't get it right,\" Cuomo said.\n\nIn response, President Donald Trump characterized the development as \"a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country!\" He later denounced \"fake news\" as the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nThe president's comments come after Buzzfeed's publication of the discredited \"Dossier,\" which was paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and Democrats as opposition research, served as the basis for the entire Russian probe.",
    " Title: U.S. Admits 14,082 Syrian Refugees in Four Years, With 97.3% Being Sunni Muslims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the four years since the Syrian conflict began, the United States has resettled a total of 14,460 Syrian refugees, with 97.3% of them being Sunni Muslims. This is according to data from the State Department Refugee Processing Center.\n\nThe data shows that of the 14,460 Syrian refugees, 14,082 are Sunni Muslims, 196 are Shi\u2019a and other Muslims, and 124 are Christians. The remaining refugees are 25 Yazidis, six Zoroastrians, three atheists, two Baha\u2019i, 14 with \"other\" religion, and eight with \"no religion.\"\n\nThe numbers of Christians and other religious minorities among the Syrians granted refugee status in the U.S. were dwarfed by those of Sunni Muslims. Although the majority of Syrians are Sunnis, the number of Sunnis among the refugees was still disproportionately high, and the number of Christians disproportionately low, when compared to the overall population makeup.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2011, an estimated 10% of the Syrian population (1.5-1.7 million) was Christian and 74% was Sunni Muslim. In contrast, Christians accounted for just half of one percent of the refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2016, while Sunnis accounted for 98.2%.\n\nThe U.S. government administration has determined that atrocities carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL) against religious minorities in areas under its control amount to genocide. However, administration officials say that its refugee program does not and will not prioritize any particular religious group when considering Syrians' applications.\n\nPresident Obama has not declared a target figure for Syrian refugee admissions for FY 2017, although a recent report to Congress said the administration \"aims to admit a significantly higher number\" of Syrian refugees in the new fiscal year than the 10,000 target initially set for FY 2016. Assistant Secretary of State Anne Richard said last week that the department is working with a stipulated target for FY 2017, but that the administration \"has been very clear that we want to bring more Syrians, so my own guidance to our staff is that we want to bring even more than we brought this year.\"",
    " Title: Autopsy Report Suggests Different Account of Michael Brown's Death, Sparks Call for Arrest of Officer Darren Wilson\n\nArticle:\n\nFerguson, Mo. \u2014 A preliminary autopsy report has led the family of Michael Brown to call for the arrest of the police officer who shot him, according to lawyer Benjamin Crump. The autopsy, conducted at the family's request by pathologist Michael Baden, suggests a different account of the events that transpired on August 9, when Brown was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.\n\nAt a news conference here on Monday, Crump stated that Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, asked, \"What else do we need to get them to arrest the killer of my child?\" Crump further explained that Baden shared his opinion that Brown did not suffer before his death.\n\nBaden revealed that Brown, 18, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. None of the bullets entered from the back, and three were recovered from Brown's body, he said. Brown could have survived all of his wounds except for the shot to the top of his head, Baden said. This shot was probably sustained last, hitting Brown as he was bending over, and exited through his right eye, he said.\n\nBaden also stated that Brown was shot from at least one foot away but the distance could have been as far as 30 feet. He said six bullets entered Brown's body and at least two bullets ricocheted and traveled back through his body. Bullet wounds to Brown's arms could have been sustained by putting his hands up or crossing his arms, he said.\n\nBaden's results could be consistent with police or witness accounts of how Brown died. Crump's position was clear. \"It verifies the worst that the family thinks happened \u2014 that he was executed,\" Crump told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"It confirms what the witnesses said, that this was an execution. That's what the witnesses said from Day One.\"\n\nBrown was unarmed when Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot him. Witnesses said Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. The shooting and police response drew racially charged protests that have sometimes turned violent.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who ordered a separate federal autopsy of Brown, said it was being performed Monday by a U.S. military medical examiner he described as \"one of the most experienced\" in the armed forces. Holder will also travel to Ferguson on Wednesday where he will meet with local officials and FBI investigators who are assisting in a federal, civil rights inquiry into Brown's shooting.\n\nThe St. Louis County Medical Examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released. The Washington Post, citing a person familiar with that autopsy, said the county autopsy indicates Brown was shot six to eight times and that he had marijuana in his system. Suzanne McCune, administrator of the medical examiner's office, said the only information the office is providing is that Brown died of gunshot wounds to the head and chest. She said she could not confirm the marijuana report.\n\nShawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist assistant who helped conduct the autopsy requested by Brown's family, told CNN Monday afternoon that while certain aspects of the investigation take time, \"what I am surprised about, that at least the preliminary results of the autopsy itself didn't come out sooner than they did.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a separate, third autopsy, citing the \"extraordinary\" nature of the case. Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Holder directed the action at the request of Brown's family. The Justice Department is conducting a separate inquiry into possible civil rights violations related to the shooting. About 40 FBI agents have been deployed to the investigation to assist in canvassing neighborhoods for witnesses.\n\nCiting the \"extraordinary\" nature of the case, Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Holder directed the action at the request of Brown's family.

    " Title: The Evolution of Journalism: A Look Back and Forward\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent weeks, the digital journalism industry has faced a significant setback with layoffs at major outlets such as BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, and Vice. This has sparked concerns about the future of journalism and its impact on democracy. However, a closer look at the history of journalism reveals that the industry has undergone numerous transformations, and the current challenges may not be as dire as they seem.\n\nAntonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, an Ideas contributor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, offers a unique perspective on this issue. Previously, he worked on Facebook's early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times bestseller and NPR Best Book of the Year.\n\nGarc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez argues that if the Founding Fathers were magically transported to today, they would find the modern journalistic ecosystem unrecognizable. However, they would recognize the emergence of social media, the blogosphere, and partisan outlets like Daily Kos or National Review. A resurrected Benjamin Franklin, for instance, would likely have a popular Twitter account, a partisan media outlet, or a podcast, rather than a traditional journalism role in a major newspaper.\n\nThe concept of \"objective\" journalism, which strives to present an unbiased account of world events, is a relatively recent development in American journalism. In the past, newspapers were overtly political, and a name like The Press Democrat signified a Democratic affiliation. Advertising was a minor concern until after the Civil War, when the growth of consumer goods created a need for newspapers to increase ad revenue and reduce political partisanship to expand circulation.\n\nJill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times, provides insights into this shift in her memoir, Merchants of Truth. In one scene, the Times' CEO asks Abramson to generate new revenue ideas, to which she indignantly responds, \"If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor.\" This disconnect between editorial and business would have been inconceivable to the Founding Fathers, who were acutely aware of the financial benefits of their journalistic endeavors.\n\nIn conclusion, the current challenges facing digital journalism may signal a shift in the industry, but they do not necessarily signify its demise. The concept of \"objective\" journalism, while a cornerstone of modern journalism, is a relatively recent development. Understanding the historical evolution of journalism can provide valuable insights into its future.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's DACA Policy and Enforcement Actions: A Look at the Current State of Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate in Congress regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has taken a new turn, with the focus shifting towards the program's 800,000 recipients and their potential vulnerability to deportation. The Obama-era executive action, which granted temporary relief from deportation to illegal aliens who entered the U.S. as minors, has been a subject of controversy due to its constitutional questionability.\n\nIn a move that has raised concerns among immigration activists, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers will be able to use DACA recipients' personal information to deport them, should the need arise. However, it's important to note that USCIS, the agency responsible for handling DACA, will not proactively provide a list of DACA recipients' names and addresses to immigration enforcement officers. This information will only be provided if requested.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled its intention not to defend the legality of DACA, citing concerns over separation of powers. The GOP has long criticized DACA as executive overreach, and a dozen Republican state attorneys general have threatened to sue the administration if they settle the DACA issue. As a result, the program was ended, with a six-month enforcement delay to allow Congress time to pass DACA-like legislation.\n\nThe question of enforcement has remained a point of contention, with Senate Republicans, such as Tom Cotton from Arkansas, viewing this as an opportunity to push for the passage of the RAISE Act, which aims to overhaul the green card process to prioritize immigrants with high skills and includes a language provision. This proposal is met with resistance from the Democrats.\n\nIn the midst of these debates, two DACA recipients were recently apprehended by the Border Patrol while allegedly smuggling illegal immigrants across the border. This incident underscores the complex and evolving nature of the immigration issue in the United States.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is crucial to maintain a neutral perspective, recognizing the constitutional questions surrounding DACA and the potential implications for both DACA recipients and the broader immigration system.",
    " Title: A Neutral Reflection on the George Zimmerman Case: A Lawyer's Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Zimmerman trial, the nation has been inundated with a plethora of opinions from politicians, pundits, and former presidents. As a journalist and a practicing attorney, I have chosen to remain silent on the matter, having had my own brush with the criminal justice system in the past.\n\nMy legal career began in an unusual manner, as I found myself serving as lead counsel for a 17-year-old boy facing the death penalty. Despite my inexperience, I, along with a more seasoned and brilliant co-counsel, managed to secure a verdict that avoided the electric chair for our client. However, the experience left me with a profound understanding of the complexities of the law and the impact of evidence in a courtroom.\n\nThe laws that govern cases as serious as Zimmerman's are intricate, and the interpretation of testimony and evidence is a nuanced process that is difficult to comprehend from an outside perspective. To second-guess the strategy of the prosecution or defense, or to judge the jury's decision, is a task that is far too complex for the average observer.\n\nPoliticians, preachers, and pundits have offered opinions and proposals regarding the so-called \"stand your ground\" laws in Florida and other states. However, it is important to note that the defense in the Zimmerman case did not rely on these laws as a central argument. The debate over their effectiveness and potential problems is a distraction from the actual events that transpired in the courtroom.\n\nThe case has also sparked discussions about racial profiling and the need for stricter laws. While the issue of racial profiling is a valid concern, it is unclear how Congress expects to determine if an individual is racially profiling another in a private context, or how new laws would apply to all races equally.\n\nOne undeniable fact that has emerged from this case is the tragic loss of Trayvon Martin. Regardless of the actions he may or may not have taken on the night of his death, his family and friends will never recover from his loss. Zimmerman, on the other hand, will live with the weight of public opinion and potential threats for the rest of his life, despite being declared \"not guilty\" by a jury.\n\nAs a journalist and a lawyer, I am not qualified to opine on the merits of this case. I have not tried enough murder cases to feel confident in my analysis, and I suspect that most of those who are vocal about it have little useful experience in the courtroom. The complexities of the law and the intricacies of the case are best left to the professionals who have dedicated their lives to understanding and navigating them.",
    " Title: Analysis: Robert Mueller's Letter to Attorney General Barr Sparks Debate Over Summary of Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent revelation of a letter penned by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Attorney General William Barr has sparked a renewed debate over the summary of the Mueller report that Barr released in March. The letter, which expressed Mueller's concerns about Barr's summary, has led to calls for Barr's resignation or impeachment from some Democratic lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the controversy surrounding the summary of the report, now dubbed the \"Great Bill Barr Summary of Findings Outrage of 2019,\" has left many questioning the validity of the criticism directed towards Barr. The Attorney General's decision to release a summary of the report's top-line conclusions shortly after receiving it was aimed at addressing the public's interest in the question of whether the President of the United States had conspired with the Russians.\n\nIn his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, Barr explained that he opposed the subsequent release of summaries of the report, as suggested in Mueller's letter, because he believed it was better for the public to receive the entire report at once. This approach was eventually taken, with the 400-page report being publicly released after redactions were made by Justice Department lawyers in collaboration with Mueller's staff.\n\nDespite the release of the full report, Democrats and the media have continued to focus on the summary, fueling conspiracy theories and accusations of a cover-up. However, Barr's summary was not found to be inaccurate by Mueller, as Barr noted that Mueller did not \"exonerate\" Trump on obstruction.\n\nBarr has faced accusations of perjury in prior congressional testimony about his handling of the report. Yet, Barr's responses during these exchanges were precise and measured, with many of the accusations stemming from his lack of specificity when discussing the complaints of unnamed Mueller staff regarding the summary's release to the press.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy about this episode is the apparent concern of Robert Mueller, or those around him, about the media coverage and political discussion surrounding the report. This focus on the political implications of the report, rather than its investigative findings, raises questions about the objectivity of those entrusted with immense investigative power.\n\nIn conclusion, the release of Robert Mueller's letter to Attorney General William Barr has reignited the debate over the summary of the Mueller report. While the controversy surrounding the summary's release continues, it is essential to maintain a neutral perspective and consider the facts of the situation, rather than succumbing to the hysteria and groupthink that has characterized much of the discussion surrounding this issue.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Dakota Access Pipeline Controversy: A Closer Look at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's Involvement and the Pipeline's Route\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing controversy surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), it is essential to separate fact from fiction. Anti-fracking activists have been criticizing the multi-state project, portraying it as a threat to American Indians and the environment. However, a closer look at the details of the $3.8 billion pipeline might dispel some of the misconceptions.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been vocal in their opposition to the pipeline, arguing that its construction would encroach on tribal lands and damage ancient tribal artifacts. They also fear potential water contamination, including the Missouri River and Lake Oahe.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the Army Corps of Engineers, which initially approved the pipeline, attempted more than a dozen times between 2014 and 2016 to consult with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe about the DAPL route. Court documents show that the tribe either failed to respond to these requests or delayed the process.\n\nMoreover, the DAPL runs parallel to an already existing pipeline, the Northern Border Pipeline, built in 1982, which has never received protests or complaints from demonstrators associated with Standing Rock. The government rerouted the DAPL several times to avoid tribal lands, and the modifications were made to preserve cultural sites.\n\nThe pipeline's route does not cross through the Standing Rock Reservation. The area is privately owned, and the tribe has argued that the land is theirs under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. However, the treaty was forged between the U.S. government and the Great Sioux Nation, not Standing Rock.\n\nEminent domain was not used on the North Dakota route, and federal officials are refusing to evict protesters occupying private property along the DAPL route, citing free speech rights. In contrast, eminent domain was used in other portions of the route in Iowa, prompting farmers to sue the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to prevent the company from gaining the right to use their property.\n\nInvestments in pipelines like DAPL have increased by 60% since 2010, and have nearly doubled from $56.3 billion in 2010 to $89.6 billion in 2013. This increase has likely raised concerns among environmentalists about the use of eminent domain.\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential to consider all aspects of the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy before forming an opinion. The misconceptions about the pipeline's impact on tribal lands and the environment should be addressed with accurate information to ensure a fair and informed discussion.",
    " Title: Trump Disputes Puerto Rico Hurricane Death Toll, Amidst Ongoing Hurricane Florence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of Hurricane Florence's approach to the US East Coast, President Donald Trump has sparked controversy by disputing the official death toll from last year's Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump stated, \"3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,\" without providing evidence for the claim. He accused Democrats of inflating the official death toll to \"make me look as bad as possible.\"\n\nThe official figure of 2,975 deaths was released last month after an independent study by George Washington University. Puerto Rico's governor, who commissioned the research, accepted the estimate as official. The study concluded that the initial death toll of 64 only included those killed directly by hurricanes Maria and Irma, either by drowning, flying debris, or building collapse.\n\nGeorge Washington University also counted those who died in the six months following the storm due to poor healthcare provision, a lack of electricity, and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.\n\nLast May, Harvard University public health researchers published a study estimating the death toll to be even higher, with about 4,600 people dying in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the hurricane due to delayed medical care.\n\nThe president's tweets came as Hurricane Florence, a category two storm projected to bring catastrophic flooding, bore down on the US East Coast.\n\nThe politics of the Thursday-morning tweets are rough. The president has guaranteed coverage of the government response to Florence will be intermixed with talk of his feud with Puerto Rico officials and questions about the veracity of his assertions.\n\nMr. Trump's dismissive attitude toward the loss of life also risks the ire of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have relocated to Florida and can cast ballots in that state's key races in November's mid-term elections.\n\nThe president, with some justification, has said the situation in Puerto Rico after Maria was exacerbated by the island's remote location and pre-existing infrastructure issues, such as an antiquated power grid. That could have been a reason to do more to help these American citizens. Instead, the recovery effort has devolved into a political tug-of-war that now includes debate over \"legitimate\" deaths from this tragedy.\n\nIn response, the Mayor of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, tweeted, \"Mr. Trump you can try and bully us with your tweets BUT WE KNOW OUR LIVES MATTER.\"\n\n\"You will never take away our self-respect. Shame on you!\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Trump hailed the US response in Puerto Rico as \"an incredible, unsung success.\" Ms. Cruz then shot back, \"If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success, God help us all.\" Last month, she described Mr. Trump's handling of Maria as a \"stain on his presidency.\"\n\nPuerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said in a statement this week that Maria was \"the worst natural disaster in our modern history.\" Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US, is home to some 3.3 million people.\n\nEven a few of Mr. Trump's fellow Republicans have spoken out against him. Florida Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring from Congress, called the president's tweets \"mind-boggling.\"\n\nShe said it is a \"warped-mind that would turn this statistic into 'fake news'\" and it \"may be a new low\" for the president. Florida Governor Rick Scott, who is currently running for the US Senate, tweeted, \"I've been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic.\"\n\nRepublican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who is also retiring, said, \"There is no reason to dispute these numbers.\"\n\n\"This is a devastating storm that hit an isolated island. And that's really no one's fault. It's just what happened.\"\n\nThe US federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has come under fresh scrutiny this week, with photos emerging showing 20,000 pallets of bottled water meant for victims still sitting on a runway in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, a year after the storm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it was investigating whether or not it placed the water bottles on the runway and if so, it would \"fess up.\"\n\nOttmar Chavez, head of the General Services Administration (GSA) in Puerto Rico, said he only became aware of the water bottles on Tuesday. Mr. Chavez said his agency had received complaints about the taste and smell of the water, and that FEMA should accept responsibility.\n\nPuerto Rican officials have previously blamed mismanagement on FEMA, whereas President Trump has said authorities on the island are incompetent.",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Market Enters Bear Territory Amid COVID-19 Pandemic Fears\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. stock market has entered a bear market for the first time in over a decade, following a significant downturn in risk assets on Wednesday that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average into bear-market territory. Equities continued their slide on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. stock indexes have been in a powerful downtrend, with all three major U.S. equity gauges set to close in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of at least 20% from a recent peak. The decline deepened after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the infectious disease first identified in Wuhan, China, in December, a pandemic. An Oval Office address about the pandemic by President Donald Trump late Wednesday failed to alleviate market anxieties going into trading on Thursday.\n\nThe illness has infected over 127,000 people and claimed nearly 4,700 lives worldwide, with market experts fearing that the pandemic could disrupt global supply chains and drive the global economy into recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, composed of 30 blue-chip companies, has been pulled lower by a significant decline in shares of component Boeing Co. The Dow entered bear-market territory on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index narrowly missed ending at bear-market levels a day ago but are expected to end at the conclusion of Thursday's trade.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow plunged 1,464.94 points, or 5.9%, to settle at 23,553.22, while the S&P 500 fell 4.9%, to 2,741.38, missing a bear-market at or below 2,708.92. The Nasdaq tumbled 4.7%, to end at 7,952.05, avoiding its bear level at 7,853.74.\n\nStocks dropped into correction mode\u2014defined as a pullback of 10%\u2014late last month as fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak began to rise.\n\nHowever, there is some hope that a stint in bear-market territory will be short-lived if the viral outbreak is effectively mitigated by governments and central banks across the globe. Historically, the period in the jaws of a bear can be lengthy.\n\nOn average, a bear market for the Dow lasts 206 trading days, while the average bear period for the S&P 500 is about 146 days, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow is currently off 29% from its Feb. 12 record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are 27% from their Feb. 19 peaks, as of late Thursday.\n\nThe move for the Dow also represents the blue-chip index's fastest move from a record high to a bear market since 1931\u201419 days. In November 1931, as the Great Depression was enveloping the U.S., the Dow took a brisk 15 days from a record to a drop of at least 20%.\n\nThe end of the bull-market run for the Dow comes only two days from its 11-year anniversary on Monday, as worries about the economic impact of the spread of COVID-19 have been accelerating by the day.",
    " Title: African-American Trump Supporter Faces Backlash, Remains Unwavering in Support\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - Supporting President Donald Trump as an African-American can be a challenging endeavor, as 24-year-old Devinn Smart, a vocal supporter of the President, can attest. In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, Smart shared his journey from a Democrat-leaning family to a full-fledged Trump supporter.\n\nGrowing up in a family of die-hard Democrats and attending a historically black university in Hampton, Virginia, Smart's political views took a significant turn when he started researching Trump. A particular line from Trump's campaign resonated with him: \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" This statement, made during Trump's appeal to black voters, caught Smart's attention, and he found himself aligning with the President's policies.\n\nAlthough he did not vote in the 2016 election, Smart publicly declared his support for Trump on Twitter shortly after the President's inauguration, complete with a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. The backlash was swift, with insults such as \"coon,\" \"bootlicker,\" and \"Uncle Tom\" being hurled his way due to his support for the President.\n\nTwice, Smart has been disinvited from preaching at spiritual revival conferences in Virginia due to his political beliefs. In one instance, a pastor demanded that Smart denounce his support for Trump on Twitter or lose his invitation. Smart questioned the pastor's actions, stating, \"My job, when I'm standing behind that sacred desk, is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And for you to tell me I can't come and preach at, not your church but the Lord's church, because I support the president? Now, are you living by the principles of the Bible?\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Smart remains steadfast in his support for Trump. He cites the President's achievements, such as a historically low unemployment rate for African-Americans, the First Step Act, a groundbreaking prison reform law, and record federal funding for historically black colleges, as evidence of Trump's commitment to the African-American community.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump won eight percent of the black vote. A new poll shows him with almost double that now, at 15 percent. Smart attended the White House in October as part of the Black Leadership Summit. During the event, he had a unique experience: he was invited to pray, an opportunity he shared with a friend who had previously dreamt of praying at the White House.\n\nAs for Smart's journey, he shared that many more African-Americans support Trump but choose to keep their support private. \"I had over 100 messages on my Twitter of people saying, 'Devinn, I support President Donald Trump, but I'm not as strong as you to come out and say it in public.'...I have a lot of people who support President Donald Trump, but they won't say it. It's secret. They're going to vote for him in 2020.\"\n\nThe Trump Campaign is hopeful that Smart's prediction holds true.",
    " Title: Former Witch and Lesbian Warns Parents About the Influence of Disney's \"The Owl House\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Disney cartoon, \"The Owl House,\" is teaching children that being a witch is a positive and powerful tool to fight evil. The show, which recently premiered on the Disney Channel, has sparked controversy as some argue that it glamorizes witchcraft and could potentially have a negative impact on young viewers.\n\nJenny Weaver, a former witch and lesbian, spoke out about the potential dangers of shows like \"The Owl House\" on \"The Prayer Link.\" Weaver, who grew up in a dysfunctional home and battled depression, recounted her own experiences with witchcraft and the dark consequences it had on her life.\n\n\"I actually watched a movie that was very popular when I was in high school and it was called The Craft,\" said Weaver. \"And the movie was about four high school witches that had all of this power, that had all of this control.\"\n\nWeaver went on to explain that she saw the power in the movie as a way out of her difficult life, but it led her down a dark path. \"I remember hearing these voices, 'Just kill yourself. Just go away. It would be better off if you would just die.' And so, I started to cut my wrists severely,\" she said.\n\nWeaver's self-harm eventually led her to the demonic realm, and she became a practicing witch. \"It was a demonic hold on my life that caused me to open doors to witchcraft and practicing spells and incantations and studying the religion of Wiccan,\" she said.\n\nWeaver warned parents to be cautious about what their children watch, stating that the realm of witchcraft is real and can have dangerous consequences. \"It's why I tell parents when I minister, it's not a joke when we say be careful what your children are watching,\" she said.\n\nWeaver, who also struggled with drug addiction and homosexuality, said it took years for her to break free from the dark realm of witchcraft. \"I was smoking methamphetamines in dope houses, sleeping in people's sheds, being tore up by bugs all day long,\" she said. \"And so, I remember just crying out to God. I cried out to the top of my lungs, I said 'God Help Me!'\"\n\nToday, Weaver ministers through prophetic worship to thousands via Facebook through her ministry Jenny Weaver Worships.

    " Title: U.S. Power Grid Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks: AP Investigation Reveals Repeated Hacks\n\nThe Associated Press has released a new investigation revealing that the U.S. power grid has been hacked repeatedly over the past decade by various foreign entities, including Iran, Russia, China, and even ISIS. The investigation found that sophisticated hackers now have the capability to strike at any moment they choose, posing a significant threat to the nation's security.\n\nThe power grid, which supplies power to the military, mass transit, business, and millions of Americans, is protected 24/7 against physical attacks and cyber attacks. However, the grid was not built with network security in mind, and as a result, it is old and outdated. The AP investigation reports that nearly a dozen times in the past decade, foreign hackers have gained remote access to networks that run the grid.\n\nStephen Swick, with American Electric Power, stated, \"We're seeing people looking for vulnerabilities, people scanning to see what types of openings they can find.\" Some of the attacks against the U.S. power grid are believed to have been carried out by hacking teams from Russia, China, and Iran. Now, even ISIS is trying to hack American power companies.\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas, with the Department of Homeland Security, said, \"We are not where we need to be, and we are very, very focused on getting to where we need to be.\" As of now, intrusions into the networks that control the power grid have not caused the kind of catastrophic blackout that experts fear. However, it is believed that many cyber attackers already have the information they need to do just that, giving them the capability to strike at will.\n\nEireann Leverett, with the Cambridge Center for Risk Studies, said, \"We're still in this era where everyone believes it's secure by default... and it's not.\" The Department of Homeland Security emphasizes that public and private cooperation is the key to fighting cyber attacks. The agency is coordinating efforts to strengthen grid cybersecurity nationwide and to raise awareness about evolving threats.\n\nSwick concluded, \"It's all real. There's lots of variables and lots of potentials that could happen.\" The investigation serves as a reminder of the urgent need for the U.S. to strengthen its cybersecurity measures to protect the power grid and the millions of Americans who rely on it daily.",
    " Title: Senate Confirmation Hearing: Ashton Carter Assures Independence as Defense Nominee, Disagrees with White House on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, President Obama's pick for the next defense secretary, Ashton Carter, emphasized his commitment to maintaining an independent voice within the administration. Carter's statements on critical issues such as Guantanamo Bay, Ukraine, and troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan, differed from the White House's stance.\n\nCarter's testimony prompted an immediate response from the White House, where press secretary Josh Earnest cautioned that President Obama, not Carter, sets policy. In response to questions about Carter's stance on arming Ukraine against Russian aggression, Earnest stated, \"A decision like this will be made by the commander in chief.\"\n\nTwo of Obama's previous defense secretaries, Robert Gates and Chuck Hagel, have publicly criticized what they perceived as White House micromanagement of the Pentagon. Carter, who is popular in the Senate, is expected to be confirmed.\n\nRepublican senators used the confirmation hearing as an opportunity to voice their concerns on foreign policy, pressing Carter on his plans to remain independent. Carter responded by expressing his support for sending arms to Ukraine in the fight against Russian separatists, a stance that differs from Obama's.\n\nCarter did not specify the type of weapons he would consider providing, but he did indicate a preference for arming Ukraine, including lethal arms.\n\nAt the White House, Earnest was asked about Carter's public opinions and attempted to put a positive spin on the new defense secretary. \"Ashton Carter is a strong believer in the chain of command,\" Earnest said.\n\nCarter also assured lawmakers that he would not be pressured into hastily closing the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In a recent statement, Carter expressed doubt about the feasibility of Obama's goal of closing Gitmo, despite supporting it.\n\nSen. John McCain, the committee chairman and an Arizona Republican, expressed concerns about White House micromanagement of the Defense Department and over-centralization of foreign and defense policy. Sen. Kelly Ayotte echoed McCain's concerns and urged Carter to commit to the committee that he would not succumb to any pressure from the administration to increase the transfers of Guantanamo detainees.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in August, Unemployment Rate Remains Steady at 4.9%\n\nThe United States added 151,000 new jobs in August, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate, however, remained steady at 4.9%.\n\nThe job growth fell short of expectations, with economists anticipating approximately 180,000 new jobs and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.8%. The economy has still experienced 78 consecutive months of job growth.\n\nThe job growth for the past few months was revised, with June numbers dropping to 271,000 from the initially reported 292,000, and July numbers increasing to 275,000 from the previously reported 255,000. The net change resulted in a slight decrease in job growth over the past two months.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose by 3 cents to $25.73. The percentage of involuntary part-time workers, as well as the labor force participation rate and the number of long-term unemployed, all saw little change.\n\nService-providing sectors performed well in August, with food services, social assistance, professional and technical services, and financial activities all experiencing growth. Health care jobs continued to increase, but at a slower pace than in recent months. Mining employment, meanwhile, continues its prolonged decline.\n\nThe jobs report has been closely monitored in recent months, as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for only the second time since the global financial crisis. The second-in-command at the Fed, Stanley Fischer, told CNBC last week that the August jobs report \"will probably weigh in our decision\" on the timing of a possible rate increase.\n\nWith job growth not meeting expectations, many analysts now expect that the Federal Reserve will not adjust interest rates during its September meeting.",
    " Title: \"Re-opening America: A Call for a More American Approach to Economic Recovery\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the discussion surrounding the reopening of local economies across the nation has sparked a debate. The approach taken by many has been criticized as too fearful and un-American, as it has often lacked the resourcefulness and ingenuity that have defined America's history of overcoming adversity.\n\nFor weeks, the nation has been grappling with the impacts of the virus, and the fear it has instilled has led to a narrow focus on worst-case scenarios. However, it is time for a shift in perspective, a shift that aligns more closely with the spirit and successes of America. We must think bigger, embrace our resourcefulness, and work towards a post-COVID-19 world that reflects the collective talents, efforts, and desire to lead and succeed with compassion.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, there are compelling arguments for reopening America. The curve has flattened, and hospitals are no longer overrun. In fact, experts have shown that the worst-case scenarios for fatalities linked to COVID-19 were over-estimated. It is time to reopen our society and bolster our consumer-driven economy, leaning on the time-tested ingenuity of the American people.\n\nThe success of large retailers such as Target, Publix, and Wal-Mart in maintaining safe environments during strict shelter-in-place orders demonstrates the potential for small, family-owned, and locally-invested businesses to do the same. These businesses, with their smaller operating margins, have a vested interest in adhering to social distancing and safety guidelines to avoid losing their hard-earned consumer base.\n\nMoreover, businesses exist to make a profit and provide value, not just for their stakeholders, but for their consumers as well. This value includes providing proven quality in their products and safe environments for commerce. The post-curve-flattening world is one where businesses must adjust to the new market conditions, innovating to survive and society to thrive.\n\nThroughout American history, businesses have proven their ability to adapt to civic, medical, and economic conditions. From the weight-related epidemic in America to the Tylenol tampering cases of the early 1980s, businesses have shown their resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. The same can be expected in the post-COVID-19 world.\n\nLenny McAllister, Director of Western Pennsylvania for Commonwealth Foundation, an award-winning think tank based in PA, emphasizes the importance of a free market-driven approach to reopening America. McAllister, a Davidson College graduate and host of radio shows in Chicago and Pittsburgh, believes that with more people making good, self-directed decisions to keep us all safe while getting our economy and society back on track, we can have more assurances that more people can overcome the medical, social, economic, and emotional impacts of COVID-19.",
    " Title: Trump Super PACs Struggle to Raise Funds Amidst Campaign's Bombastic Rhetoric and Mixed Signals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race for the 2016 presidential election, Super PACs backing Donald Trump are facing a slow and challenging start in their fundraising efforts. The candidate's incendiary rhetoric and policy pronouncements, as well as mixed signals about his reliance on outside financial help, have left his campaign war chest significantly smaller compared to Hillary Clinton's.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, Clinton had $42.5 million in the bank at the start of June, while Trump's campaign had only $1.3 million. Trump has repeatedly taunted big donors and boasted for months that his campaign would not rely on them or Super PACs, only to appear to change his tune more recently.\n\nSeveral donors supporting Trump expressed their concerns to \u2588\u2588\u2588. Billionaire broadcaster Stan Hubbard, who has donated $100,000 to the pro-Trump Great America Pac, stated, \"He's got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth. He needs a clearer message without name-calling.\" Hubbard also criticized Trump's recent trip to Scotland, suggesting that his children should have handled the public relations instead.\n\nLikewise, potential Super PAC donors have expressed similar concerns about Trump's rhetoric and message. Michael Epstein, who has raised significant funds for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and plans to vote for Trump, said, \"I might back a Super PAC if Trump has a strong GOP convention next month and really 'turns it around.' But I'm less and less hopeful. He can't get out of his own way. He's going to have to demonstrate more presidential behavior.\"\n\nFour key pro-Trump Super PACs have been launched, but they have only run about $5 million in ads collectively. In contrast, the leading pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA Action, began a massive television and digital ad blitz in key states reportedly costing almost $130 million in mid-May.\n\nSigns of turmoil and slow growth among the Trump Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, are palpable. Texas mega-donor Doug Deason, who recently met with Trump, said that the candidate's top fundraiser had signaled to them that a new Super PAC, Make America Number One, backed by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, was deemed the \"official\" one. However, Make America Number One will reportedly seek big checks from GOP donors who are not yet ready to back Trump but want to stop Clinton.\n\nBillionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged some $100 million to help Trump, has been cautious and slow in opening his checkbook after at least two meetings with Trump since late May. Adelson is said to be considering setting up his own Super PAC and talking to key Republican operatives about cobbling one together to help Trump.\n\nAdelson is reportedly talking to other wealthy donors, including Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus and energy investor Toby Neugebauer, about teaming up on a Super PAC. One GOP operative with ties to Adelson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the casino mogul may put up his funds in installments, predicting that about half would come after Trump picks his running mate.\n\nExisting Super PACs are trying to bring in big checks with mixed success. The Great America Pac, which boasts veteran GOP operative Ed Rollins as a strategist, has raised $5 million and has commitments for another $4 million. The Pac has plans for a few more events to court big donors in Los Angeles and Oregon before the Republican national convention and hopes to raise $150 million by election day.\n\nOther pro-Trump Pacs are ramping up their fundraising and ad drives. Laurance Gay, the managing director of the Super Pac Rebuilding America Now and a former lobbyist, said it had raised $2 million, most of which has paid for two TV ads. Rebuilding America Now expects to raise and spend close to $20 million through the GOP convention next month and then hopes to raise another $80 million for the rest of the campaign season.\n\nHowever, the Pac's fundraising efforts have been met with challenges. Gay and Tom Barrack, a private equity executive and old friend of Trump's, met with Adelson in June to woo him, but it is unclear if they will receive a check. Gay acknowledged that \"we're well behind in fundraising.\"\n\nVeteran money man Fred Malek, who has been a top fundraiser for GOP governors, cautions that Trump's policies and temperament pose obstacles for Super PAC fundraising. Malek stresses that GOP donors and voters \"want to see a nominee who is more inclusive rather than divisive and recognizes that politics is a game of addition and not a game of subtraction.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Scandals and the Debt Ceiling: A Tense Washington Amidst Ongoing Investigations and Budgetary Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a flurry of political scandals and the looming debt ceiling, Washington D.C. finds itself in a tense standstill, with lawmakers juggling their oversight responsibilities and the need to address pressing issues such as the budget, immigration, jobs, and the Keystone pipeline.\n\nThe U.S. government technically hit the debt ceiling over the weekend, prompting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to take \"extraordinary measures\" to ensure the government can continue to pay its bills. This is a familiar dance, with Lew referring to the \"standard set of extraordinary measures\" in his letter to House Speaker John Boehner on May 17.\n\nWhile Congress has vowed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities, the ongoing investigations into the administration's handling of the Benghazi terror attack, IRS targeting of conservative groups, and the Justice Department's seizure of phone records from Associated Press journalists, among others, have squeezed out time for other priorities.\n\nCongressional Republicans are expected to seek cost-cutting concessions in exchange for any increase in the debt ceiling, but have yet to specify what these will be. House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, indicated that Congress is in the process of discussing how to address the debt ceiling and \"Washington's out-of-control spending.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is also grappling with the fallout from the scandals, with the White House counsel's office focusing on White House cooperation with the investigations. Former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card suggests that the current chief of staff, Denis McDonough, is keeping the president and his senior staff focused on other matters.\n\nThe issue of gun control, which was a priority for President Obama in his second term, seems to have taken a backseat, but the budget, including the possibility of major entitlement and tax reform, still looms. The Senate and House have each passed their own budgets, but an agreement has not been reached on ironing out the differences between the two versions.\n\nSome work on Capitol Hill will likely continue unaffected by the scandals. A Senate committee is moving toward finalizing its work on an immigration bill this week, while bipartisan House negotiators are crafting a bill of their own. The question remains, however, whether one of the two tasks will suffer as lawmakers and the administration navigate the complexities of Washington's current political landscape.",
    " Title: Consumer Expectations and Online Data Collection: A Study by Digital Content Next Under the California Consumer Privacy Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) becoming law, digital media companies are reassessing their online data collection policies and procedures to ensure compliance. The CCPA, considered the most comprehensive consumer privacy law, is seen as a benchmark for other states to follow.\n\nTo understand consumer expectations better, Digital Content Next, the trade association of major digital publishers, surveyed a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The study sheds light on how consumers engage with online tracking and their expectations around online privacy.\n\nThe survey reveals that consumers generally expect websites and apps to collect data to protect them from fraud and malicious activity (59%), improve the overall user experience (55%), and offer personalized experiences (49%). However, consumers do not expect outside vendors to collect data for reuse or sale (32% for reuse and 24% for sale).\n\nWhen asked about the data practices of outside vendors, fewer consumers expect future reuse (38%) or selling (24%) of their personal data. Interestingly, when given a clear explanation of how their data will be used and the benefits, consumers' expectations align more with the practice (47%).\n\nConsumer awareness of their ability to opt out of data collection is relatively low, with only half (52%) aware of ways to choose not to participate in online data collection. Furthermore, fewer consumers have opted out or plan to do so (40%) compared to those who don't know how to opt out or don't understand what it means (44%).\n\nFor those opting out of online data collection, common actions include deleting browser cookies, turning on \"Do Not Track,\" and installing ad blockers. However, these methods do not completely remove consumers from online data collection. Deleting cookies can log users out of news and subscription sites, while \"Do Not Track\" is often ignored by the industry, especially third-party ad tech vendors.\n\nThe new CCPA regulation may change this, raising the bar for everyone. The survey findings highlight the need to align data collection practices with consumer expectations. Offering seamless and simplified controls is an important part of the compliance process and, arguably more importantly, of preserving and growing the trust of publishers' audiences.",

Mayor Pete Buttigieg has taken a significant lead in the New Hampshire primary race, with 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters supporting him. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are tied for second place, each with 15 percent.\n\nThe poll, released Tuesday, indicates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 9 percent, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 6 percent, billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 3 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 2 percent, and everyone else tested in the survey at 1 percent or less.\n\nButtigieg, the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls, has seen a significant surge in support, rising 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll conducted in September. Warren's support has dropped 10 points since the previous poll, while Biden's support has dropped 9 points.\n\n\"With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire's Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,\" said New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque.\n\nThe poll's release comes two and a half months before the Iowa caucuses, which kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary. A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent.\n\nThe poll's sampling error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points, and the survey was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators.\n\nThe poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. However, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run. The poll was conducted before former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., entered the presidential nomination race, and he stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.",
    " Title: Fed Chairman Bernanke Hints at Possible Third Round of Quantitative Easing\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( CNNMoney ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open on Wednesday for the possibility of more stimulus measures, suggesting that the U.S. central bank could implement a third round of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing (QE), if the economy worsens.\n\nDuring a press conference, Bernanke stated, \"In case things get worse, we are prepared to protect the U.S. economy and financial system.\" This statement, repeated several times, was interpreted by many as a signal that the Fed may renew QE if the economy fails to meet expectations.\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, commented in a note to clients, \"Mr. Bernanke's press conference surely left few doubts that the Fed will take more aggressive action and renew QE if the economy fails to perform as they expect.\"\n\nMeanwhile, University of Pennsylvania economist Justin Wolfers tweeted, \"I read the Fed as saying: One more bad jobs report, and we'll do more.\"\n\nThe job market remains a significant concern for Bernanke, with the unemployment rate still high at 8.2%. The latest jobs report showed employers added only 69,000 jobs in May, marking the weakest hiring in a year.\n\nBernanke also addressed Europe's financial crisis and the uncertainty surrounding the \"fiscal cliff,\" which is dampening U.S. growth. (Read: Fiscal cliff: What you need to know)\n\nIn response to these concerns, the Fed extended its existing policy known as Operation Twist and lowered its expectations for the job market and the broader U.S. economy this year. The central bank predicts the unemployment rate will end the year between 8% and 8.2%. Two months ago, it was more optimistic, predicting the jobless rate could fall as low as 7.8%.\n\nThe Fed also revised its growth forecast, predicting the economy will grow between 1.9% and 2.4% this year. In April, it had forecasted that the economy could grow as much as 2.9%. This weaker outlook prompted the Fed to extend Operation Twist by $267 billion.\n\nOperation Twist swaps short-term bonds for ones with longer durations, thereby pushing interest rates lower on mortgages and business loans. The hope is that cheaper credit will reach consumers and businesses, who will then boost the economy by spending more. However, the effect on Main Street has been questionable, with mortgage rates at record lows but new home sales remaining choppy and banks still reluctant to lend to those with less-than-perfect credit.

    " Title: Media Bias Alleged in Chris Matthews' Remarks on Gun Control and Texas-Colorado Murders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent segment on MSNBC's Hardball, host Chris Matthews drew criticism for his comments linking Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Second Amendment to the murders of prosecutors in Kaufman, Texas, and a prison guard in Colorado. The Media Research Center has accused Matthews of ignoring the criminal element of the prosecutor slayings and instead trying to claim the perpetrators were exercising their Second Amendment rights.\n\nThe controversy stems from Matthews' assertion that people are using their Second Amendment rights to settle disputes with public officials, citing the Kaufman and Colorado cases as examples. However, a closer look at the details of these cases reveals a different narrative.\n\nOn March 30, the bodies of 23-year Army veteran and Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found in their home, victims of an apparent assassination. A national security expert suggested the murders were intended to send a message of intimidation by drug cartels and criminal gangs.\n\nIn Colorado, a top prison official was gunned down in his home. The Aryan Brotherhood, a violent prison gang, is suspected of being behind the murders. The FBI has declassified 156 pages of internal documents showing that the AB is known for engaging in brutal, high-profile killings to impress upon foreign narcotics cartels and other organized crime groups that they are the best organization to handle a domestic US ground game.\n\nCriminals killing public officials is in no way comparable to law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights. Matthews' comments, like those of other left-leaning figures, have been criticized for failing to discuss the criminal elements of these cases and others involving firearms.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kaufman County murders, county courthouses across Texas are implementing increased security measures, including more armed guards. Prosecutors in the Dallas area have also been urged to carry their own guns for self-protection against armed violent criminals.\n\nThe Media Research Center has accused Matthews of using the Kaufman and Colorado cases to push a false narrative and smear millions of law-abiding citizens. The organization has called on Matthews to discuss the criminal element of the \"gun\" problem in the United States and to acknowledge the role of criminal gangs and cartels in these tragedies.",
    " Title: New Jersey Middle School Teacher Reassigned After Kneeling During Pledge of Allegiance\n\nA New Jersey middle school teacher has been reassigned following incidents where the educator was observed kneeling during the school's morning recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The incidents took place at Sgt. Dominick Pilla Middle School, named after a U.S. Army Ranger who died during a 1993 mission in Somalia.\n\nThe teacher's actions sparked a heated debate among parents, who believed the silent protest was inappropriate for a middle school setting and potentially agenda-driven, according to the Philly Voice. The Voice also reported that partisan political behavior is prohibited on school premises and during school hours.\n\nDuring a school board meeting of Vineland Public Schools in early October, parents expressed their concerns about the teacher's behavior. Resident Ron Maccri stated, \"Teachers are paid to educate our students, they're not paid to indoctrinate our students. What this woman is doing would be bad in any school, but because it's in the (Sgt. Dominick Pilla) School \u2014 who gave his life for our military \u2014 it's reprehensible.\"\n\nAnother resident, Randy London, a U.S. Coast Guard veteran, also voiced his displeasure during the meeting. \"That type of behavior offends me,\" London said. \"I'm not saying anyone needs to agree with everything, but if that is the district's policy, there should be no teacher\u2026taking a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance.\"\n\nLou Russo, president of the Vineland Education Association, suggested that students could learn from the teacher's missteps. \"It would be one thing if [the teacher] was proselytizing to kids that you can't stand, or you should not stand for this reason, but she's not doing that,\" Russo insisted, pointing out that teachers themselves can not force students to stand for the pledge anyway.\n\nOn Tuesday, the district determined the teacher's fate, with Pilla school Principal Ismael Bermudez reassigning the teacher away from conducting homeroom. Joseph Rossi, the district's executive director of personnel, added, \"The district and the teacher agree that this is a reasonable solution for all parties.\"\n\nRusso stated that the school deployed what they believe was a reasonable accommodation for the teacher. \"It is a reasonable compromise that balances a school employee's free exercise of their religion versus a parent's concern of how that free exercise may influence their child,\" Russo said, adding that they requested a legal opinion from their state affiliate and await its findings.\n\nThe teacher reportedly defended her First Amendment rights and insisted that her actions were not politically motivated. The district and the teacher have agreed on this reasonable solution, striking a balance between the teacher's right to freedom of religion and the parents' concerns about the potential influence on their children.",
    " Title: WHO Expresses Concern Over Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in Iran, Calls for Swift Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a concerning development, the World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed alarm over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Iran, where health officials confirmed 18 cases and four deaths in just two days. The latest cases were reported in Qom, Tehran, and Gilan, marking a significant increase in the number of infections in the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, described the situation as \"very worrisome\" during a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva on Friday. He stated, \"The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome.\"\n\nThe WHO chief further elaborated, \"These dots are actually very concerning.\" He emphasized the need for increased engagement with Iranian health officials to gather more information about the patients and contain the virus. Tedros warned that the window of opportunity to contain the virus is narrowing and urged swift action before it closes completely.\n\nDr. Jaouad Mahjour, assistant director of emergency preparedness at WHO, noted that Iran's health-care system has the \"basic capacity\" to detect and contain the coronavirus. However, world health officials remain concerned about the potential spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems.\n\nAs of Friday, there are 1,152 cases across 26 countries, including eight deaths, outside of China, according to Tedros. The respiratory disease is known to spread through human-to-human contact, droplets carried through sneezing and coughing, and germs left on inanimate objects.\n\nThe WHO's warning comes as the small outbreak in Iran has been linked to a case in Canada and another infection of a 45-year-old woman in Lebanon after those patients traveled to Iran. The rapid spread of the virus in Iran underscores the global nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need for coordinated, swift action to contain its spread.",
    " Title: Federal Execution of Wesley Ira Purkey Halted Due to Mental Health Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nTERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge has halted the execution of Wesley Ira Purkey, a man convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing, due to concerns about his mental health. The execution was scheduled for Wednesday evening at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his eleventh-hour legal bids failed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C. imposed two injunctions prohibiting the federal Bureau of Prisons from moving forward with Purkey's execution. The Justice Department immediately appealed, and an appeals court panel kept in place both injunctions in orders Wednesday evening. Appeals to the Supreme Court were still pending.\n\nThe legal questions surrounding Purkey's mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Purkey's lawyers argue he suffers from advancing Alzheimer's disease, and his delusions include believing his planned execution is part of a conspiracy involving his attorneys.\n\nThe issue of Purkey's mental health has been a topic of debate in the legal system for nearly two decades. In a landmark 1986 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution prohibits executing someone who lacks a reasonable understanding of why they are being executed.\n\nThe execution of Wesley Ira Purkey has been halted due to concerns about his mental health, and the legal battle surrounding his case is expected to continue into the evening. The Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past, and the question of whether Purkey will die is likely to go down to the last minute.",
    " Title: Warren's Senate Campaign Ends in Debt Despite Record Fundraising\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the Boston Globe reports that Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren, who raised a record-breaking $42 million for her Senate race this year, has found herself in debt. Despite her campaign's significant financial resources, Warren has asked for donations to help pay off the remaining bills.\n\nWarren, a Harvard Law professor and a renowned scholar of American debt, attributed the financial shortfall in part to the thousands of volunteers who joined her campaign, stating that it led to increased expenses for last-minute coffee and pizza.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Warren wrote, \"One of the results of our embarrassment of riches was, well, I'll come out and say it - we ended up with a little bit of debt. Everyone, we need a little more money to pay off our final bills. Can you help one more time?\"\n\nIt is not uncommon for campaigns, even successful and well-funded ones, to end in debt. However, the disclosure is notable for Warren, given her career-long study of the roots of debt in American families and businesses.\n\nWarren acknowledged the high cost of her campaign, stating, \"I know this was the most expensive Senate race in the country. And I know that we've sent you a bazillion e-mails asking for money over the past year. I'm sure you expected them to all end once the votes were counted - and yes, that's what I thought too. Right now, I'd rather be writing about filibuster reform and banking regulation. But we still have a little more to do to wrap things up. Can you help one more time to finish 2012 strong?\"",
    " Title: Ohio Polls: Romney's Tightening Gap and the Impact of Early Voting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe race for Ohio is narrowing, but Mitt Romney does not lead in any single poll in the current Real Clear Politics average, with two polls showing Obama with a five-point lead. Romney has been chipping away at Obama's poll lead, but the Democratic advantage in party-ID has increased across these polls. As of now, it is becoming increasingly possible for Romney to win Ohio without ever showing a consistent lead in the polls or any lead at all.\n\nIn the past week, Romney has narrowed his deficit in the RCP average from 2.5 points to 2.1 points. However, the average party-ID advantage for Democrats in these polls has risen from 5.5 to 6.5 points. A significant factor contributing to the increase in Democrats' share in the polls is early voting.\n\nEarly voting complicates likely-voter screens, as pollsters can only work with the information provided by respondents. If a voter claims they have already voted, they are automatically passed through the likely-voter screen. However, some voters may lie about their voting status, a phenomenon known as social-desirability bias.\n\nIn Ohio, where early turnout is currently estimated to be about 15 percent of voters, responses in the current polls claim that 23 percent of registered voters have already voted. This means that polls are overstating early voting by eight percentage points on average. This discrepancy could be due to voters requesting an absentee ballot and reporting it as voting, mailing in ballots that haven't been counted yet, or simply lying about voting when they haven't.\n\nIn the polls' early-voting results, Obama leads on average by 20 points. However, it is unclear how much the Democratic advantage in early voting has shrunk from 2008. Obama's early-voting advantage gives him a lead that Romney is only slowly eroding with his Election Day voter lead. However, if pollsters are finding more respondents who are claiming to have already voted than what the records show, some of this early-voter advantage is illusory.\n\nDespite Obama currently enjoying a 2.1-point lead, Romney remains in a strong position to win Ohio on Election Day. Here are some reasons for the optimism coming from Boston:\n\n1. Romney's strength with independents continues to grow: Last week, when Obama led the Real Clear Politics average by 2.5 points, Romney led among independents by an average of 8.7 points. Romney has since increased that lead with independents to 12.3 points, which is why he has been able to cut Obama's overall lead even as the polls have leaned more Democratic. In 2008, Obama beat McCain by eight points among independents. It would be almost impossible for Obama to win Ohio while suffering a 20-point swing among independents.\n\n2. The polls give Democrats a better turnout advantage than they had in 2008: In 2008, Democrats beat Republicans in turnout by five points. The current polls show an average D+6.6 turnout advantage. A D+5 turnout in 2008 gave Obama a 4.5-point victory, while he is currently leading by only 2.1 points on an even greater D+6.6 turnout.\n\n3. History suggests late deciders will break against the incumbent: This rule is often met with skepticism, but it is likely to benefit Romney at least some on Election Day. In 2004, late deciders broke heavily against George W. Bush, even though he was a wartime president. John Kerry beat Bush by 25 points among voters who decided in the last month, 28 points among voters that decided in the three days prior to Election Day, and 22 points among day-of deciders. Those voters were 20 percent of the Ohio electorate; while this year there are expected to be fewer late deciders, Obama cannot afford to lose among them by those margins and still win.\n\n4. Republicans tend to outperform their share of the national vote in Ohio: In the last nine elections, the GOP has outperformed in Ohio. With Romney currently running just ahead of Obama nationally, it seems more likely that Obama's lead in Ohio has more to do with the higher party-ID advantage than a dramatic shift in Ohio from the past nine elections.\n\n5. Strength with crossover voters in Ohio: In addition to Romney's strength with independents, in the past two elections, the GOP candidate has won over more Democrat votes than they've lost Republican ones. Obama's Ohio win in 2008 was based entirely on his strength with independents and the wave turnout, both of which are highly unlikely to be repeated in 2012. If Romney wins with independents by anywhere near the current average and takes more crossover voters than Obama does, Obama would need to exceed 2008 turnout greatly to win.\n\nWith less than two weeks until Election Day, we will soon know the results. However, as more Ohio polls come in, it is important to remember that the picture for Romney in Ohio is better than many pundits would have us believe. It only takes a quick look at Romney's rallies to remind us that it's not 2008 anymore, as Republicans have reclaimed the enthusiasm advantage that led to such sweeping 2008 victories for Democrats. That GOP enthusiasm has become contagious since the debates, and it is exactly what has Team Obama so afraid these days. All they have left to hang their hopes on is a slim lead in the polls, and even that might not be enough on Election Day.\n\n-Josh Jordan is a small-business market-research consultant.

    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts Aim to Avert Government Shutdown as Congress Nears Deadline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final hours before a potential government shutdown, House Republicans are optimistic about passing their $1.1 trillion, nine-month funding bill. According to top aides and lawmakers on the GOP whip team, between 150 and 175 Republicans are expected to support the bill, with some Democratic support helping to secure its passage.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his staff have been in contact with Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) throughout the process, despite Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) public concerns about provisions in the bill that would loosen Wall Street regulations and campaign finance laws.\n\nThe deal to increase donation limits to national party committees was negotiated by top aides to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). The larger package, known as a \"cromnibus,\" locks in many Democratic and Republican funding priorities deep into 2015.\n\nAs of late Wednesday evening, Republicans were not making formal fallback plans if the bill failed, and House Democrats were not whipping against the measure. The government will begin to shut down by Friday morning if nothing passes. Almost no one expects a shutdown.\n\nLawmakers are angry that they only had one full day to read the 1,600-page spending bill, which extends all government funding through September 2015, and Homeland Security funding through February. When lawmakers started digging into the bill, they found provisions that help big banks trade derivatives in units backstopped by a government guarantee and allow all national party committees to collect $777,000 each year from individuals, up from $32,400 annually under current law.\n\nHigh-profile lawmakers like Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have vowed to vote against the bill, backed by progressive groups on the outside who are seizing on Pelosi's (D-Calif.) skepticism. Republicans are also concerned that the legislation doesn't pick a strong enough fight with President Obama over his unilateral changes to immigration law.\n\n\"All these provisions in this bill got worked out in a bipartisan bicameral fashion or they wouldn't be in the bill,\" the speaker said. Boehner added, \"When you get to the end of a two-year session of Congress, a lot of work gets built up and never gets to cross one floor or the other floor. And as a result, when we get to the end of session, members try to find a way to get their legislation across the finish line because of not really issues on the House side, more issues on the Senate side, to facilitate their ability to move legislation, some of the stuff ends up in one bill.\"\n\nThe mood was tense in the Capitol Wednesday when GOP leaders started whipping the bill, and Senate Democrats were unsure how many of their House counterparts would vote for the bill. But Pelosi and Boehner have been in close contact. On Wednesday morning when they spoke, Boehner demurred when Pelosi asked how many Democratic votes he needed. That responsibility falls to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Boehner answered. Boehner warned Pelosi that if the large bill failed, he would have a short-term funding bill ready for immediate consideration.\n\nIf Republican defections swell, Scalise could catch blame, but if the GOP posts better-than-expected numbers, he'll start off the 114th Congress with a stronger hand. Pelosi is trying to regain her own strong hand, which has been weakened dramatically by her party's disastrous showing on Election Day. She was involved in the negotiations but objected to many of the last-minute additions to the package and is using the situation to boost her sway with disaffected Democrats. Pelosi believes she can get Republicans to change the bill, but GOP leadership staff has repeatedly made clear that they will not change the omnibus.\n\nRepublicans have one victory in this lame duck: they cleared a renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act by a huge margin. The GOP leadership had hoped to include this legislation in the omnibus, but House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) insisted the TRIA extension include unrelated changes to the Dodd-Frank financial services law. Democrats protested, but the bill passed with 417 votes.",
    " Title: Analysis: Mike Pence's Debate Performance Outshines Tim Kaine's in Vice Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine on Tuesday night was a stark contrast in styles and substance, with Pence emerging as the clear winner in a debate that exposed the Democratic campaign's demagogic tactics.\n\nPence, with his statesman-like demeanor, stood in stark contrast to Kaine, who often interrupted Pence and came off as a clumsy hatchet man and shameless party hack. Pence's smooth and substantive performance was a stark contrast to Kaine's labored lines and sweaty lunges.\n\nKaine devoted much of his energy to rattling off opposition research, much of it too insiderish and transparently canned to impress anyone. Pence, speaking much more slowly and authoritatively, reiterated basic points about Hillary Clinton's tax-and-spend policies and feckless foreign policy.\n\nPence deftly answered the litany of accusations against Donald Trump by noting that Kaine was indulging in the very \"insult-driven campaign\" he pretended to find so shocking in Trump. Pence's calm re-directing of the debate back to serious issues was a wise choice, and even the moderator, who never asked Kaine any pointed questions, found his off-topic trivialities and obsession with Trump's tax returns tiresome enough to correct him at one point.\n\nKaine, stuffed with weeks of memorized cheap shots, began to short-circuit under such corrections and Pence's steady presence. While an irritated-looking Kaine was trying to catch his breath after one of his extended attacks on Trump, a cool Pence simply noted that Clinton had called much of the country a \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\nPence's handling of the abortion issue was particularly effective, as he pointed out Kaine's inconsistency in his supposedly fervent Catholic faith and his support for partial-birth abortion and taxpayer-financed abortions. Pence's thoughtful discussion of the sanctity of life and adoption as an alternative to abortion made Kaine's partisan gibbering look ignoble.\n\nIn debates, less is more, as Pence showed. Against a flailing, gabbing, demagogic opponent, it is better to step back and let the audience see that the person who talks the most often says the least. Come Sunday, Trump would do well to imitate his running mate.",
    " Title: Bipartisanship Alive and Well: A Look at Collaborative Efforts Across the Political Aisle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the nation's capital, where political divisions run deep, a group of Republicans and Democrats, hailing from various administrations and industries, are working together to move the nation forward. This core group, which includes a registered Republican who has served four presidents, including one Democrat, and partnered with Michelle Obama's office on the Let's Move anti-obesity campaign, is a testament to the power of collaboration and the 60/40 rule: agreeing on 60 percent of the issues and focusing on areas of commonality.\n\nThis individual, who has built complex public-private partnerships to solve significant problems, is not unique among those who align on one side of the aisle but find ways to work with the other. In 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined forces with this individual as members of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Working collaboratively with public health agencies and the Obama administration, they implemented the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, ultimately removing 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products.\n\nSimilar collaborative efforts can be seen in various bipartisan commissions and blue-ribbon panels working on issues as diverse as Social Security, biodefenses, tax reform, and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These efforts, ongoing at the state and federal levels, demonstrate that the end goal is what matters, not party ideology.\n\nThe principles of bipartisanship, common in many areas beyond politics, are employed in these collaborative efforts. Personal consideration, listening, and respect are the cornerstones of these relationships. The focus is on fixing the problem, not on ideological differences. Tension may arise at the beginning of each relationship, but data-driven progress brings a continuity of results, a collegial environment, and a celebration of success.\n\nRonald Reagan, known for his sunny optimism, won the nation over with his graciousness in political discourse. However, the shouting on cable TV and the blogosphere is not the whole picture. Bipartisanship is alive, though not as well as it could be, and in need of further nurturing. It is a reminder that the nation's progress depends on collaboration, not division.",

The First Lady's appearance followed a seemingly awkward introduction by Jack Nicholson, who was introducing the long list of nominees.\n\n\"These nine movies took us back in time and all around the world,\" Obama said, referring to the nominated films. \"They made us laugh, they made us weep, and they made us grip our armrests just a little tighter.\" She continued, \"They taught us that love can endure against all odds and transform our lives in the most surprising ways, and they reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we can dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage to believe in ourselves.\"\n\nAfter handing the envelope to Nicholson to announce the winner, Obama quipped, \"Hang on a second,\" before making the announcement. The winner was Argo, a film that tells the true story of the CIA's efforts to rescue six Americans from Tehran during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.\n\nSocial media reactions to Obama's appearance were mixed, with some praising her for her eloquent speech and others criticizing her for what they perceived as too many celebrity-laden appearances, especially during the same weekend she did the \"Evolution of Mom Dancing\" with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nDespite the backlash, the First Lady took to Twitter to express her excitement about announcing the Best Picture winner, tweeting, \"It was a thrill to announce the #Oscars2013 best picture winner from the @whitehouse! Congratulations Argo!\"\n\nThis is not the first time a U.S. First Lady has made a surprise appearance at the Oscars.

    " Title: Seeking Easter Amidst a Divided Nation: A Reflection on the Resurrection and National Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous and divisive year, the concept of Easter holds a profound significance. As we navigate through a time marked by deep-seated divisions along racial, gender, class, and religious lines, the story of the Resurrection serves as a beacon of hope and unity.\n\nThe United States is currently experiencing a period of self-interest and division, with the actions of the President serving as a catalyst for both support and opposition. Regardless of one's political stance, the President's actions have created a shifting tide of energy, fueling waves of anger and outrage, only to be followed by a return of these emotions back onto the shore.\n\nWe are on the brink of a \"me-first, we-first, America-first\" future, where the ability to care for the less fortunate and protect the most vulnerable is questioned. The question of who belongs within our \"we\" and the need to fortify our borders with walls and armed sentries is a stark reminder of a past we thought we had left behind.\n\nAmidst this tumultuous time, Easter offers a moment of respite, a break from the raw, natural world we find ourselves in. A faultless man, who absorbs the faults of others, a man who refuses to retaliate in the face of scorn, and who sacrifices himself for the good of the world, embodies the spirit of Easter. Through his embrace and defeat of death, he brings others life, offering a message of love, forgiveness, and unity.\n\nThe scriptures that tell the story of Easter are jarring when juxtaposed against the values of our current times: \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only son\" and \"while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" The question remains, can we ever become an Easter people? What will it take to return to grace and become whole again or perhaps for the first time?\n\nThe answer is unclear, and it may require a significant event such as an election, a disaster, or a cataclysmic loss. The resistance may need to reach its pinnacle, or the President may need to hit his penitential floor. Alternatively, it may be up to us to take the lead, to grow so sick of the vitriol, bias, cynicism, and trolling that we collectively undergo an internal transformation, resulting in national atonement.\n\nImagining such a future may seem far-fetched, especially when warships are moving and MOABs are exploding, and we brace ourselves for the next breaking news report or fiery tweet. However, the hope and promise of Easter can still be found in the hopeful sunshine of Sunday morning and the dream of a different future, bright enough to light a path that helps us get there.\n\nPerhaps, on such a day, we will catch a glimmer of a different future, bright enough to guide us towards Easter and the unity it represents. And maybe once we see it, we will take a step, towards Easter, and towards a more united, compassionate, and forgiving nation.",
    " Title: Trump's Unyielding Ego and the 2020 Election: A Psychological Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the latest presidential debate, the focus has been on Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, a stance that has been a recurring theme in his campaign. This refusal, while shocking, is a reflection of Trump's persistent efforts to undermine the democratic process, a pattern that has been evident throughout this month.\n\nThe debate's coverage has been dominated by Trump's refusal to concede defeat, a move that, while psychologically understandable, is potentially detrimental to his campaign. Trump's obsession with polls and his inability to accept a likely defeat, which he perceives as the ultimate humiliation, has led him to manufacture excuses for his impending loss. In this case, the excuse is the claim that the election is rigged.\n\nThis claim, a transgression of an unwritten and almost sacred democratic rule, not only risks his defeat but could widen the margin of his defeat. The American public is increasingly unsettled and unnerved by Trump, and the more they are exposed to him, the more they become unsettled and unnerved. He is perceived not as an agent of change, but as a radical and destabilizing force.\n\nNarcissism, in this instance, the inability to accept a likely loss to a woman in the biggest contest in the world, is at the core of Trump's response about not being prepared to say he would abide by the outcome of the election. The American public saw, almost instantaneously, in that answer, that the Republican nominee for president puts himself - his vanity, his self-obsession, his need to project dominance and therefore his need to win - far above everything in life, including the best interest of the nation.\n\nThis character flaw has led him to several terrible moments during this election, including the one in Wednesday's debate that may have sealed his defeat. Earlier in this campaign, he was unable to cite his favorite Bible passage. Here's one that he could have learned from and that foreshadowed his fate: \"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.\"\n\nPeter Wehner, who served in the last three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer, offers this insightful analysis. The article underscores the potential impact of Trump's unyielding ego on the 2020 election.",
    " Title: Fauci Disputes Predictions of Second Wave of Covid-19 Cases in the US\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading US public health expert and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, has expressed doubts about the likelihood of a second wave of Covid-19 cases in the United States. The US has reported over 2 million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 115,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been sidelined by the White House since April, following disagreements with President Donald Trump's stance on reopening the economy. He stated that increases in cases in several states are not necessarily indicative of a \"second spike\" of infections.\n\n\"When you start to see increases in hospitalization, that's a surefire situation that you've got to pay close attention to,\" Fauci said. He added, \"It is not inevitable that you will have a so-called'second wave' in the fall, or even a massive increase if you approach it in the proper way.\"\n\nFauci advised maintaining social distancing and continued use of masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), close to 80% of Americans have self-isolated in the last month, and 74% wore face coverings in public either always or often.\n\nIn the past week, 19 states, including Texas, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Florida, have reported seven-day rolling average highs for new Covid-19 infections. In Arkansas, for example, Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, announced a record number of cases in the previous 24 hours. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, placed a seven-day hold on lifting or loosening social restrictions.\n\nIn Maryland, Baltimore announced that it would not be moving into phase two of planned reopening. In a statement, the mayor, Bernard Young, said, \"Let me be crystal clear with everyone: I, more than almost anyone, would love to see that Baltimore city is open and safe, but that simply is not what the data is telling us at this time.\"\n\nThe CDC could not confirm reports of striking increases in coronavirus hospitalizations but would monitor the numbers \"very closely.\" Such developments sent stock markets into a tailspin on Thursday, before a slight recovery on Friday.\n\nSome experts, such as former CDC director Julie Gerberding, have become more optimistic that a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed swiftly. However, Gerberding cautioned, \"That doesn't say anything about the speed, the safety, and the durability and all of the other criteria that have to come into play before we have something that we can count on to give us that population immunity.\"\n\nIn New York City, mass protests have sparked fears of a resurgence of the virus in the American pandemic center. However, new infections are now at the lowest level in the entire US. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Friday, \"We were the No 1 state in terms of infection...and now we are the last state in terms of rate of transmission. That is because New Yorkers stepped up. They were smart. They were disciplined. They did what they had to do, and we need to stay there.\"",
    " Title: Ted Cruz Raises $20 Million in Third Quarter, Leading Up to Iowa Caucus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant boost to his campaign ahead of the Iowa caucus, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has reportedly raised nearly $20 million in the past three months, according to an internal memo obtained by NBC News. This substantial fundraising haul positions Cruz as a strong contender in the final month before the caucus.\n\nA campaign aide told NBC News, \"We're showing we have the strength going into the Iowa caucus. If people want to get behind a candidate who can go the distance, we're showing we've got that.\"\n\nThe $20 million Cruz raised in the third quarter surpasses the $12.2 million he brought in during the previous quarter, bringing his total yearly fundraising to $45 million. In comparison, during the same period, Republican candidate Ben Carson, who was then a rising contender in polling, raised a similar $20 million, while Marco Rubio brought in $6 million.\n\nCruz is the first candidate to report their fundraising totals for this quarter, which technically ends on Thursday. At the beginning of October, Cruz's campaign had the most cash on hand\u2014$13.8 million\u2014but it has yet to publicly release its current cash reserves.\n\nThe formidable fundraising by Cruz, who often emphasizes on the campaign trail that his campaign is built to last, is mirrored by substantial fundraising by several super PACs supporting his candidacy. Through September, the super PACs had raised $38 million, with the organizations spending little of that money to date.\n\nThe additional funds provide Cruz with expanded resources to potentially purchase advertising in the upcoming early states. However, through the summer and fall, the campaign resisted spending on traditional television and radio advertising, putting in less than $1 million so far. The campaign has yet to reveal its advertising plan, stating it will buy television airtime on a week-to-week basis.",
    " Title: New York State Imposes Lockdown as Coronavirus Cases Surge Past 11,600\n\nNew York state reported a surge of over 4,500 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, pushing the statewide total to 11,600, as the state prepares for an unprecedented lockdown from Brooklyn to Buffalo. The state's largest city, New York City, accounted for the majority of the new cases, with more than 2,400 new cases reported, raising the total number of sick to 8,115, city officials said.\n\nThe virus claimed at least 15 more lives in the city on Saturday, bringing the death toll to 60. The day before, COVID-19 claimed 14 lives between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., a troubling rate of more than one death per hour. The statewide coronavirus death toll meanwhile exceeded 70.\n\nNationwide, there were more than 25,000 cases with 300 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University revealed Saturday. New Jersey joined four other states \u2014 New York, California, Illinois, and Connecticut \u2014 in imposing restrictions on movement to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nIn response to the mounting crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo promised to purchase 6,000 new ventilators and two million virus-blocking N95 masks. A million of the masks will be sent to health care responders in the city, and 500,000 would go to Long Island, he said.\n\nHospitals statewide have been directed to end elective surgeries and alter their space and staffing to accommodate the flood of infected. \"We are now working with hospitals to reconfigure space to get more beds and find more staff to manage the beds,\" Cuomo said.\n\nNew York is also reviewing four possible locations for temporary \"field hospitals,\" to be set up by the Army Corps of Engineers and operated with FEMA assistance. The four sites being mulled are the city's Javits Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. The Javits Center could be turned into a 1,000-patient hospital in the next few days, Cuomo said.\n\nThe Army Corps has also been eyeing empty hotels and college dorms as potential medical space. The Navy still intends to send the USS Comfort to New York Harbor in the next few weeks, where overflow, non-coronavirus hospital cases would be treated. New York's goal is to increase the state's number of hospital beds from the current 50,000 up to 70,000.\n\nShoring up existing hospital space and building more is vital. Some 15 percent of the state's sick have required some hospitalization\u2014so far about 1,600 people. In New York City, 1,160 people have required hospitalization, including 260 in an ICU.\n\nThe lockdown, which takes effect 8 p.m. Sunday night, will set tight limits on how New Yorkers shop, work, and play\u2014all designed to minimize close contact and prevent a healthcare-system-crippling spike in cases. The lockdown means all New Yorkers, even the young, must stay home or at least stay apart.\n\nThe governor continued urging all but essential workers to stay home, or at least stay apart. In some encouraging news, the number of cases in Westchester\u2014where the state's first major outbreak was located\u2014is slowing. \"That is good news,\" the governor said, proof that the original \"containment zone\" is working. Still, there were at least 294 cases there as of Saturday.\n\nIn New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy signed an executive order directing most residents to stay home. Jersey's sick tally rose to 1,327 Saturday, with 16 deaths. That's up from 890 cases and 11 deaths on Friday. Both Murphy and Cuomo attributed their states' hikes in reported infections on increased testing. \"No one is spiking any footballs, but we have been ahead of the curve on testing,\" Murphy said.\n\nFurther jangling area nerves, all flights were briefly suspended Saturday afternoon at airports from Philadelphia to Westchester after an air traffic controller trainee who was stationed at the FAA's New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma tested positive for the virus. The center, which handles high-altitude flights and flyovers, was shut for a deep cleaning.\n\nSunday night's lockdown will force the shutdown of most of the state's businesses, with the exception of grocery stores and bodegas, liquor stores, gas stations, laundromats, and restaurant delivery services. The city has appointed a \"Food Czar,\" Kathryn Garcia, to ensure no one goes hungry, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\nThose lucky enough to still be working in \"non-essential\" businesses must do so from home; and exercising out of doors was limited to such solitary, non-team endeavors as walking, biking, and running. Saturday's sunny, low-50s weather drew crowds of New Yorkers\u2014all eager to shake off the self-isolation blues\u2014to the city's parks and beaches.",
    " Title: Bloomberg Poll Shows Obama Leading Romney by 13 Points, Raising Questions About Polling Accuracy and Campaign Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by Bloomberg shows President Barack Obama leading his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, by 13 points among likely voters. According to the poll, Obama has 53 percent of the vote, while Romney has 40 percent. The survey was conducted from June 15-18.\n\nThe poll shows that Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has yet to repair the damage done to his image during the Republican primary. Thirty-nine percent of Americans view him favorably, about the same as when he announced his presidential candidacy last June, while 48 percent see him unfavorably - a 17-percentage point jump during a nomination fight dominated by attack ads.\n\nThe survey also shows that a majority of likely voters, 55 percent, view Romney as more out of touch with average Americans compared with 36 percent who say the president is more out of touch.\n\nHowever, the poll results have raised questions about its accuracy and the current state of the presidential race. Some analysts have pointed out that the sample used in the survey is skewed, and that other polls, such as those conducted by Rasmussen and Gallup, show Romney ahead by identical 47-45 margins.\n\nAdditionally, some have questioned whether Obama's lead is as strong as the poll suggests, given that he is tied or down in new polls out of Michigan and Iowa - both states that he won by double digits in 2008.\n\nFurthermore, some have pointed out that Obama's lead in the polls may be due in part to a solid month of failed attacks, exploded narratives, party defections, botched events, inadvertent tells, and dreadful economic news that the president has faced in recent weeks.\n\nIn light of these questions, some have speculated that the US could cross back into negative job growth this month, as economic numbers are being revised downward today.\n\nOverall, the poll results have sparked a debate about the accuracy of polling in the presidential race and the current state of the campaign. As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Obama's lead will hold or if Romney will be able to close the gap.",
    " Title: Sen. John McCain Criticizes President Obama's Foreign Policy, Cites Lack of Leadership and Strategy\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized President Barack Obama's foreign policy, stating that the lack of leadership over the past eight years has led to the \"unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II.\"\n\nMcCain specifically addressed the issue of Russian hacking, stating that President Obama's response was insufficient and lacked a clear strategy. \"The president's response was sort of an acknowledgement and endorsement of what they've already done,\" McCain said. \"We need a select committee. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.\"\n\nMcCain also expressed concern over the lack of a strategy and policy towards cyber attacks, stating that the United States has been \"totally paralyzed\" in response to these attacks. He added that the cyber attacks are not limited to the election, but are happening \"every single day in other areas of our military and all kinds of different aspects of American life that they are able to penetrate.\"\n\nFurthermore, McCain cited the situation in Syria as an example of the consequences of a lack of American leadership. \"What's happening here when we see the seizure of these ships, when we see the cyber attacks, when we see the dismemberment of Syria, when we see the tragedies that are taking place there which are heartbreaking, actually heartbreaking while we sat by and watched all this happen, this is a sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II,\" McCain said.\n\nMcCain concluded by stating that the current state of affairs is a result of an \"absolute failure of American leadership.\" He argued that when America does not lead, \"a lot of other bad people do\" and that this is why the world is seeing the \"slaughter in Aleppo that breaks your heart.\"",
    " Title: Alabama Senator Doug Jones Expresses Concerns Over Witnesses, Documents in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with ABC's The Week, Alabama Senator Doug Jones, who won the special U.S. Senate election in 2017, has expressed his concerns over the lack of witnesses and documents in the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nJones, who is currently facing a re-election bid in 2020, argued that the Senate needs to interview witnesses and obtain documents to ensure a \"full, fair, and complete trial.\" He criticized the president for ordering his top aides not to testify and for refusing to turn over documents.\n\n\"It means witnesses, it means documents, it means getting the information out now, in this very serious matter, and not over the course of the next few months,\" Jones said.\n\nThe senator also pointed out that Democrats have drawn up an \"obstruction of Congress\" charge against the president for directing \"the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas\" in the buildup to impeachment. The White House remains locked in a legal battle over Congressional subpoenas.\n\nJones expressed his concern over the lack of evidence in the impeachment case, stating, \"I would like to see a full and complete picture. And we don't have that because the president has refused to have his people come and testify and deliver documents.\"\n\nHowever, Jones also indicated that he could oppose impeachment if evidence does not support Trump's removal. \"If those dots aren't connected and there are other explanations that I think are consistent with innocence, I will go that way too,\" he said.\n\nIn a recent poll on the Alabama Senate race, Jones trails former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville, and Representative Bradley Byrne. The poll shows that only 23 percent of those surveyed favor Jones' re-election, with 54 percent of voters 65 and older not favoring his re-election.\n\nWhen asked whether his re-election concerns were affecting his vote, Jones denied making a political calculation. \"This has to do with the future of the presidency, and how we want our presidents to conduct themselves,\" Jones said. \"If I did everything based on a pure and political argument, all you'd need is a computer to mash a button.\"",
    " Title: Rubio Questions Significant Impact of Tax Overhaul on American Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - In a statement that could potentially undermine his party's narrative about the recent tax reform ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has expressed doubts about the law's substantial impact on American workers.\n\nIn an interview with The Economist published on Thursday, Rubio stated, \"There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they're going to take the money they're saving and reinvest it in American workers. In fact, they bought back shares; there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.\"\n\nThe tax reform, which passed through the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December without Democratic support, permanently reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Tax cuts for individuals, however, are temporary and expire after 2025.\n\nRepublicans, including President Donald Trump, have maintained that their tax reform will result in increased take-home pay for workers and have pointed to the bonuses some workers received from their employers as evidence the law is effective. Rubio, who voted for the proposal despite advocating for a larger child tax credit, had lobbied party leaders for this provision.\n\nIn response to Rubio's comments, Olivia Perez-Cubas, Rubio's spokeswoman, said in an email, \"Senator Rubio pushed for a better balance in the tax law between tax cuts for big businesses and families, as he's done for years. As he said when the tax law passed, cutting the corporate tax rate will make America a more competitive place to do business, but he tried to balance that with an even larger child tax credit for working Americans.\"\n\nThe tax reform is the only significant legislative achievement of the Republicans since President Trump took office, as they approach the midterms, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and about a third of the 100-member Senate's seats are being contested.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated earlier this month that the tax bill, as written, is projected to add $1.9 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.",
    " Title: Assessing Obama's Middle East Policy: A Retrospective on the Arab Spring and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn May 2011, President Obama delivered a speech at the State Department, outlining a significant shift in American policy towards the Middle East. The speech, delivered amidst the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, signaled a move away from traditional utilitarian interests towards a focus on universal rights, political and economic reforms, and opposition to violence and oppression.\n\nThe president's speech emphasized that these principles were not secondary but a top priority, to be translated into concrete actions. However, in the ensuing years, particularly in the case of Egypt, the Obama administration has faced criticism for perceived timidity, indecisiveness, and a lack of decisive action in line with the president's eloquent rhetoric.\n\nCritics, such as Vali Nasr of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, argue that U.S. policy, whether by design or inertia, may be inadvertently returning to a pre-Arab Spring, Islamophobic, order-at-all-costs policy, aligning the U.S. with countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia. This shift in perception has raised questions about the U.S.'s commitment to change and its ability to navigate the complexities of the Middle East effectively.\n\nThe ongoing political instability in Egypt and the Syrian conflict serve as stark reminders of the challenges faced by the Obama administration in implementing its new policy direction. The question remains whether the U.S. can find a balance between its traditional interests and its commitment to change, without being perceived as reactive, shortsighted, or complicit in human rights abuses.",
    " Title: U.S. Recognizes ISIS Atrocities Against Christians and Minorities as Genocide: A Critical Step Towards Protecting Persecuted Communities in Iraq and Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as \"genocide\" is a significant step, but many warn that it is only the beginning of the process.\n\n\"In my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army. The designation is a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave, and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities, and they believe they can do it without repercussions,\" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.\n\nIn northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ. \"As Assyrians of the Middle East, we are on the verge of extinction,\" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq. Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.\n\n\"The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,\" she said. \"Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.\"\n\nSecretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy. Advocates are already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.\n\n\"There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted,\" said Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq.\"\n\nThere is already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities can return home, govern themselves, and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination.\n\n\"If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel-poor part of the world, you will support the idea of a safe haven,\" said Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project.\n\nIn spite of the horrors they've experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith. \"They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ, that they find themselves praying more, that they're thirsty for the Gospel more,\" Taimoorazy said.\n\nNow, the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks, but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities. They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House.",
    " Title: Romney Defends Campaign Strategy Amidst Conservative Criticism and Polling Gap\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS News, Mitt Romney addressed the criticism his campaign has faced from conservative voices regarding the direction of his presidential bid. \"I've got a very effective campaign,\" he stated, \"it's doing a very good job. But not everything I say is elegant.\"\n\nThe comments come in response to leaked recordings from a private fundraiser held last spring, in which Romney described 47% of the electorate as viewing themselves as victims, dependent on government services, and likely to vote for President Barack Obama.\n\nFollowing the release of these comments, Romney's campaign responded aggressively, with the candidate holding a press conference shortly after the comments emerged. However, the ensuing controversy, Romney's response, and his criticism of Obama over violence in the Arab world in the previous week have fueled a narrative advanced by some conservative thought leaders.\n\nPeggy Noonan, a conservative columnist for The Wall Street Journal, this week described Romney's campaign as \"incompetent,\" a term she stood by in a Thursday column. \"I was being polite,\" she said, \"I really meant 'rolling calamity.'\"\n\nSimilarly, Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative publication The Weekly Standard, likened Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as \"two presidential candidates who - when they thought they were speaking privately to their fellow 1 percenters - have shown contempt for fellow Americans.\"\n\nIn the CBS interview, Romney pushed back against charges that his 47% comment meant he was writing off nearly half of the country. \"I want to make it very clear,\" he said, \"I want to help 100 percent of the American people.\"\n\nRomney also addressed recent national and battleground state polling that appears to give Obama a slight edge over Romney, either within or just outside of the sampling error for each survey. \"We've got a campaign which is tied with an incumbent president to the United States,\" Romney stated.\n\nIn addition, Romney announced plans to ramp up his campaign schedule with a bus tour, aiming to connect with voters directly. When asked if his skills in turning around businesses, a reputation he and his supporters tout, would be applied to his campaign, Romney stated, \"Our campaign doesn't need a turnaround.\"",
    " Title: Shift in Strategy: Republicans Broaden Focus Beyond Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant departure from their long-standing strategy, Republicans and their affiliated groups are broadening their campaign messages, moving away from a singular focus on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This shift in strategy is becoming increasingly evident as the 2014 midterm elections approach.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is currently in a tight reelection race against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, has recently distanced himself from the repeal of Obamacare in Kentucky, where the state's version, Kynect, is relatively popular. McConnell's shift is subtle but meaningful, as he had previously taken a hard-line stance on repealing Obamacare during his primary campaign.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity (AFP), a conservative advocacy group expected to spend over $100 million this election cycle, has also adjusted its strategy. In the past, AFP had a laser-like focus on Obamacare, spending millions of dollars on anti-Obamacare campaigns in key districts and states. However, the group's recent activities suggest a broader focus, with ads attacking wasteful government spending and campaigns against the Export-Import Bank, which is not related to Obamacare.\n\nThis shift in strategy is not limited to McConnell and AFP. The AFP Foundation, a partner group, recently launched an $850,000 ad buy in Wisconsin that focuses on taxes, another issue not directly related to Obamacare.\n\nThe change in strategy is not only visible in the Republicans' campaign messages but also in the polls. A recent CNN poll found that 38% of people wanted to either replace the law or get rid of it, a significant decrease from the 43% who felt the same way in November.\n\nElizabeth Wilner, a political analyst with the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan polling group, noted that Republicans are starting to use the word \"fix\" in their campaigning instead of \"repeal.\"\n\nThe shift in strategy comes as Republicans, who gained control of the House in 2011, have voted more than 50 times on a full or partial repeal of the health care law. However, the pace has fallen off dramatically in recent months. This shift in focus could indicate a recognition by Republicans that a singular focus on Obamacare may not be as effective in the current political climate.\n\nAFP spokesman Levi Russell predicts that the issue will not go away, especially as the elections approach and new premium rates are announced this fall. \"Our role is going to be to remind folks how we got here in the first place,\" he said. The change in strategy suggests a recognition by Republicans that they must appeal to a more diverse audience that has become more accepting of the federal health care program approved in 2010 without Republican support.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Reaches \"Definitive\" Deal with ZTE Amidst Congressional Objections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, the Trump administration has reached a \"definitive\" deal with Chinese tech giant ZTE, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced Thursday. The agreement comes despite strong objections from Congress.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, ZTE will pay a $1 billion fine, replace its management, and submit to oversight from the U.S. Commerce Department to alleviate the crippling penalties imposed due to the company's previous evasion of sanctions on North Korea and Iran.\n\n\"We are literally embedding a compliance department of our choosing into the company to monitor it going forward,\" Ross said in an interview with CNBC. \"They will pay for those people, but the people will report to the new chairman because we are also having them replace the entire management and the entire board.\"\n\nThe deal was initiated following a personal request from Chinese President Xi Jinping, to whom President Trump was instructed to look into easing restrictions on ZTE. Ross touted the agreement as a victory, stating that the previous strict actions \"brought... a $17 billion company to its knees, more or less put them out of business,\" and that the new agreement is \"something I think even more effective.\"\n\nHowever, the deal has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted, \"The deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks.\" He further stated, \"When it comes to China, despite his tough talk, this deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks.\"\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, a leading GOP critic, tweeted that the deal \"will do nothing to keep us safe from corporate and national security espionage.\"\n\nThe agreement stipulates that if ZTE is found not to comply with the terms of the new agreement, strict penalties will be enforced, including the $400 million in escrow in addition to the $1 billion fine. The deal is now in effect, and the future of ZTE hangs in the balance.",
    " Title: \"2017: A Year of Journalistic Errors and Missteps in U.S. Media\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. media landscape was marked by a series of high-profile errors and missteps, with several major news outlets, including CNN, The New York Times, and ABC News, coming under scrutiny for inaccurate reporting.\n\nOne of the most notable incidents occurred in December when CNN reported that Donald Trump Jr. was colluding with Wikileaks over stolen documents. The network claimed that a man named Mike Erickson emailed Trump Jr. on Sept. 4, 2016, with a link to Wikileaks documents and the decryption key needed to access them. However, a copy of the email given to \u2588\u2588\u2588 showed that it was actually sent on Sept. 14, 2016, after the stolen documents had already been leaked to the general public. Furthermore, Erickson has no apparent ties to Wikileaks or Russia.\n\nAnother instance of misreporting involved The New York Times, which had to \"look into\" its own fake news when former FBI director James Comey questioned its reporting. The NYT claimed that U.S. intelligence officials intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the election. Comey called the reporting \"almost entirely wrong\" and warned media outlets about relying on sources who don't have a full understanding of \"what's going on.\"\n\nIn the week leading up to the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany in July, CNN anchors reported that President Trump would not be confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country's meddling in American elections. The CNN report\u2014which relied on a single, anonymous source\u2014turned out to be dead wrong.\n\nAn ABC News reporting error resulted in a stock market panic and the suspension of reporter Brian Ross earlier this month. Ross reported that former national security adviser Mike Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Trump ordered him to make contact with the Russians. Hours later, ABC clarified that Flynn wasn't asked to contact Russia until after the election, during the Trump team's transition period. The story quickly fizzled from Trump-Russia collusion to standard preparation for an incoming presidential administration.\n\nThree CNN employees resigned over a poorly-sourced story on the Trump transition team in June. Relying on a single, unnamed congressional source, CNN claimed that Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation over a meeting with a Russian banker that took place shortly before Trump's inauguration. CNN retracted the story and apologized to Scaramucci after multiple parts of the report were proven to be inaccurate.\n\nBloomberg News was forced to correct a bombshell report in December that claimed Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records related to President Trump and his family. The story claimed that Mueller had \"zeroed in\" on Trump. Bloomberg later corrected the report, noting that the bank records \"pertain to people affiliated\" with Trump, not the president himself.\n\nCNN broke another flawed bombshell in May. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, while applying for his security clearance, had failed to disclose two meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. CNN described the story as \"the latest example of Sessions failing to disclose contacts he had with Russian officials.\" CNN quietly walked back the scoop seven months later, noting that the FBI specifically told Sessions he wasn't required to disclose the meetings. In other words: CNN's report excoriated Sessions for simply following protocol.\n\nJournalists at multiple outlets, specifically CNN, consistently pushed the false claim that Republican donors had originally funded the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. Republican donor Paul Singer funded the firm behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, to conduct opposition research on candidates including Trump during the GOP primary. However, Singer had no involvement in the dossier, which has played a central role in the Trump-Russia narrative.\n\nAs former FBI Director James Comey geared up for a congressional testimony in June, CNN found the perfect opportunity to make some bold\u2014but incorrect\u2014predictions. CNN reported that Comey would testify that he did not tell Trump he was the subject of an investigation, as it would be improper for him to do so. CNN was proven drastically wrong when Comey released his prepared testimony, complete with the confirmation that he assured the president that he was not under FBI investigation.\n\nA number of media outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, ABC News, and the Associated Press spent the year perpetuating a false claim Hillary Clinton made during the 2016 presidential debates. Each outlet incorrectly reported that \"all 17 intelligence agencies\" agreed that Russia meddled in the election. The truth is only four intelligence agencies evaluated and made judgments about Russian interference because the rest, like the Department of Energy and the Drug Enforcement Agency, have little authority on the matter.\n\nNBC News published what the network hyped as a \"potential bombshell\" in September. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's notes from the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer contained the word \"donations\" near a reference to the Republican National Committee, the network reported. NBC began walking back the anonymously sourced story almost immediately, before a report in Politico debunked the \"bombshell\" altogether. Despite what NBC's sources told the network, the word \"donations\" did not appear in Manafort's notes, which weren't considered to be damaging to the Trump team at all.\n\nIn August, The New York Times \"obtained\" and published a draft of the National Climate Assessment (NCA), quoting anonymous scientists who feared \"the Trump administration could change or suppress the report.\" There's just one problem: despite the paper's fear mongering, the draft report had already been publicly available for months.\n\nReports about \"fake news\" on Twitter turned out to be fake news themselves. CNN reported that \"fake news\" was higher in swing states, citing a study from the Oxford Internet Institute. However, the researchers in the study never talked about \"fake news,\" but rather \"junk news\" that apparently comes from mainstream conservative outlets like the Washington Examiner.",

The first ad, which appeared in search results for those who Googled Bush's name, was a subtle nod to the race. The second ad, however, seemed more like an attack ad, as it included the line \"We need leaders who will stand against Common Core,\" a national school-curriculum standard supported by Bush but opposed by conservative-minded supporters of state autonomy and less government intervention.\n\nSenator Paul, who is \"still a few more months\" away from making a 2016 decision, spoke on \"The Kelly File\" later that night, stating, \"Most of us believe in less federal government and more decentralized government... For Jeb Bush to run in the primary will be very, very difficult.\"\n\nDavid Payne, a Republican strategist and senior vice president at Washington, D.C.-based VOX Global, gave a mixed review of the \"digital shadow boxing\" between the potential candidates, suggesting that GOP 2016 hopefuls will have to do more and better to capture the attention of Republican primary voters.\n\n\"Facebook is a part of the established media landscape,\" Payne told FoxNews.com. \"Jeb Bush wasn't breaking any new ground with his announcement on this platform. He'll need to be a lot more innovative to get Republican primary voters interested in him.\"\n\nPaul's counterpunch was \"intelligent but the expectation\" from Paul's relatively tech-savvy followers, according to Payne. He also emphasized the importance of a balanced approach to digital and traditional media for the candidates running for president.\n\n\"It's critical for (the candidates) to get smart about their balance of digital versus traditional media,\" Payne also said. \"Republicans running for president merely have to glance at the online campaign of Barack Obama in 2012 for the sobering reasons to significantly raise their investment in digital and social media.\"\n\nThe effort to elect Carson also entered the mix before the end of the day. The National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee announced they would open an office in Iowa on Saturday, a historically significant state as it holds the first caucus of the presidential election cycle.\n\n\"We are so far ahead of the pack in Iowa and New Hampshire,\" John Philip Sousa IV, the SuperPAC's national chairman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. However, Sousa insisted that the announcement wasn't prompted by Bush's big news, stating that his group had been looking for office space for months.\n\nPolitical strategists argue that if Bush indeed triggered a starting gun, it was the one that forced big donors to get their money off the sidelines, particularly those waiting to see if Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, or 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney would try to become the party's establishment candidate.\n\n\"If you're going to run, go do it,\" Robert T. Grand, an Indiana-based Republican donor, who was one of the leading donors to George W. Bush's 2004 campaign, told The New York Times. \"I think you've got a short period of time. This announcement triggers the start.\"\n\nHowever, other strategists argue that Bush's announcement was not a 2016 turning point, in large part because he also plans to open a leadership PAC, which will help him travel around the country to speak but is not a full-fledged campaign PAC.\n\nTwo other top 2016 GOP hopefuls also seemed to use Bush's announcement to draw attention to their own efforts. Texas GOP Senator Ted Cruz stated on \"Special Report\" that Bush is a \"good man\" but said he would wait until Bush officially decides in the coming months before assessing his potential impact on the GOP primary.\n\n\"It is not a surprise that Washington fights hard against anyone trying to change the culture,\" Cruz said. \"But I can tell you, outside of Washington, people are frustrated... with politicians who say one thing and do another.\"\n\nA spokesman for Florida GOP Senator Marco Rubio, another potential White House candidate, told reporters, \"Marco has a lot of respect for Governor Bush and believes he would be a formidable candidate. However, Marco's decision on whether to run for president or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the American Dream -- not on who else might be running.\"",
    " Title: Obamacare Enrollment Numbers Show Modest Increase in November, Still Short of Initial Goals\n\nArticle:\n\nThe enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have shown a modest increase in November, with approximately 100,000 people signing up on the federal healthcare exchange, according to a report by Bloomberg. This figure was confirmed by a source familiar with the program's progress, although Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters declined to confirm the specific number.\n\nPeters did, however, state that the agency expects the final numbers will show an increase for November. This increase would still be significantly lower than the initial goal of 800,000 people in the state and federal exchanges by now, as stated by the administration.\n\nDespite the lower-than-expected enrollment numbers, the figure represents a substantial increase from October's enrollment of under 27,000. Several states running their own exchanges have also reported steady climbs in enrollment, although some, like Oregon, are still facing technical problems that are hindering sign-up.\n\nPeters stated, \"We're in the process of scrubbing final data and expect to report November numbers in mid-December. But we expect that enrollment will increase with the technical improvements we've made. Enrollment is taking place across our customer service channels and the surge in enrollment that many states who are running their own marketplaces have reported.\"\n\nThe administration had initially hoped for about 800,000 people in the state and federal exchanges by now, and about 7 million by the end of March. Officials announced over the weekend they had met their targets for making key fixes to the website, which is now working faster and with fewer crashes and errors. However, they acknowledged the website is far from perfect despite the repair effort, and will need more work.\n\nThis article first appeared on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Pro at 7:41 a.m. Dec. 2, 2013.",
    " Title: Congress to Conclude 113th Session with Last-Minute Drama over Government Funding and Terrorism Insurance\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 113th Congress prepares to conclude, lawmakers are set for a final flurry of legislative activity, with the House and Senate expected to pass government-funding bills and renew a terrorism insurance program this week. The deadline for avoiding a government shutdown is Thursday, marking the final gasp of legislating before Republicans take full control of Capitol Hill in the next Congress.\n\nThe House GOP leaders are expected to unveil their government-funding bill, unofficially dubbed the \"cromnibus,\" on Monday. The legislation will keep most of the government open through September 2015 but extend Department of Homeland Security funding only until February. The shorter DHS funding deadline is intended to pressure President Barack Obama over his recent executive action ending the deportation threat for several million undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe government-funding bill will be closely watched, with all eyes on Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) as they try to corral enough GOP support to get the bill over the finish line. Dozens of House Republicans have expressed various levels of unease with the legislation because it does not specifically bar Obama from freezing deportations. Democrats are expected to come to Boehner's rescue, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California signaling so far that she won't whip her members against the bill.\n\nThe legislation could hit the House floor by Wednesday, giving the Senate one day to pass it to avoid a government shutdown. The House has canceled its votes Monday evening for the White House Christmas party, so the GOP leadership has just two days to get its troops in line.\n\nThe controversy over Obama's immigration policy will spill into 2015. Boehner has said that the new Republican-controlled Congress, which comes into session Jan. 6, will work to change Obama's executive order when DHS funding comes up for renewal next year. However, it's not at all clear how Congress will be able to revise or alter the president's unilateral action.\n\nRenewing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act has proved a bit dicier in Congress' rush to leave town. The federal government provides a backstop for insuring against terrorist attacks. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has been pushed to the negotiating table by Boehner and his leadership, and he is trying to hash out a deal with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) The two sides were on the brink of an agreement last week, but Hensarling wants to insert into the package reforms to Dodd-Frank regulations passed several years ago. House GOP leadership aides vow that they will not let the negotiations fall apart and will pass the measure.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to debate and vote on a resolution authorizing the use of military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The measure, being pushed by Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), won't have time to reach the Senate floor or be taken up by the House. The debate, however, will set a benchmark for lawmakers when they come back to debate this issue more fully in the next Congress.\n\nTwo other matters will also get some attention during the next 96 hours. First, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who are switching their respective roles in January, will try to hammer out a last-minute agreement on executive-branch nominations, the final time Obama will have that opportunity during his presidency under a Democratic-run Senate.\n\nAnd the House Ethics Committee is being closely watched over whether it will make any late announcements on high-profile cases. The secretive panel is scheduled to meet privately several times this week. If the Ethics Committee does not act on these pending cases before the end of this Congress, it will have to vote to take them up again once the next Congress begins. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) will take over as Ethics Committee chairman next year from Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas).",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Democrats Gaining Ground Over Republicans in Midterm Elections, with Economy as Top Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent CNN/ORC poll, Democrats have edged out Republicans 47% to 45% in the generic ballot, a shift of six points from a CNN poll three weeks ago. The poll, released Tuesday, indicates that the Democrats' gains are primarily in the Northeast and not in the competitive races that could determine control of the Senate.\n\nThe \"generic ballot\" question, which asks Americans to choose between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican in their vote for U.S. House, suggests a national shift toward the Democrats, if not in key races in key states. The poll comes a week after the U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, and while poll respondents overwhelmingly think the economy is the more important issue.\n\nThe poll also indicates that most Americans have a low opinion of Congress's handling of the ISIS threat, with 60% disapproving. This comes just weeks after members of Congress absconded from Capitol Hill without a vote on military action against ISIS to campaign for reelection in their districts.\n\nHowever, the poll shows that the economy is more important than military action against ISIS among voters by a 2-1 margin. This may explain why the Democrats have gained strength on the national \"generic ballot\" question.\n\nDemocrats gained the most ground among men and independent voters, two key groups that could help Democrats in competitive races this November. Men took a 7-point swing toward Democrats from the previous poll, bringing the party within 6 points of Republicans' 49% support.\n\nRepublicans also lost support among independents as Democrats saw a 7-point bump, giving them a 44-42% advantage over rivals.\n\nThe traction for Democrats comes in the wake of an expanded military campaign ordered by President Barack Obama. Roughly two out of three Americans said the economy is more important than military action against ISIS in determining who they'll vote for in the midterms.\n\nThese numbers reveal a different mindset than in the lead-up to the Iraq War, when 49% said in September 2002 that the possibility of war with Iraq was a more important factor than the economy. That may be because most Americans, 59%, do not consider the conflict with ISIS to be a war, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday.",
    " Title: Tom Perez's Nomination for Labor Secretary Faces Republican Resistance Amidst Scrutiny and Praise\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has nominated Tom Perez, the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to be his next Labor Secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, Perez, a son of Dominican immigrants, would replace Hilda Solis who resigned in January.\n\nObama praised Perez as a man who embodies the American promise, stating that if one works hard, they can succeed regardless of their background. Perez, 51, worked his way through college and law school before joining the Justice Department and becoming Maryland's state labor secretary.\n\nThe nomination, however, has prompted immediate Republican resistance. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized the appointment as \"an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination.\" Sessions cited Perez's past work for the advocacy group Casa de Maryland, arguing that Perez has sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers.\n\nSen. David Vitter (R-La.) also announced his intention to block the Perez nomination, citing the Justice Department's alleged failure to respond to a 2011 letter he wrote with questions about federal enforcement of the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nDespite the Republican opposition, the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, praised Perez as a champion for ordinary working people. Trumka expressed hope that Perez, as Labor Secretary, would vigorously enforce job safety standards, wage laws, and anti-discrimination rules, and would speak out forcefully for working families and their workplace rights.\n\nThe White House portrays Perez as someone in line with Obama's sense of social justice. The administration lauded Perez for his work in settling the nation's three largest fair-lending housing cases, boosting enforcement of human trafficking laws, and protecting the rights of veterans and students. Perez also led the Justice Department in challenging voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.\n\nPerez's confirmation hearings are expected to feature more questions about a scathing inspector general's report released last week that revealed internal racial hostilities in the Civil Rights Division and found Perez gave misleading public testimony when he said in 2010 that political appointees did not make the decisions to drop prosecution of New Black Panther Party members.",
    " Title: Romney Outraises Obama by $21 Million in May, Bolstering Fundraising Network for the General Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the upcoming presidential election, Mitt Romney's campaign team outraised President Barack Obama's by approximately $21 million in May, according to campaign finance reports filed on Wednesday.\n\nRomney and his allies, including super PACs and the Republican National Committee, raised around $86 million in May, compared to Obama's team, which brought in roughly $65 million. This trend, if sustained, could position Romney favorably for the November election.\n\nTo capitalize on this momentum, Romney's team is planning a weekend gathering at a Utah ski resort, inviting over 100 high-profile donors who have raised $100,000 or more. The event will feature Romney, his top campaign staff, and notable GOP figures such as Karl Rove, Tim Pawlenty, Rob Portman, Paul Ryan, and Bobby Jindal.\n\nWhile Obama's campaign has been characterized as small-donor-driven, Wednesday's reports indicate that his allies are also mounting a significant big-money push. The reports show that Obama's allies landed three new million-dollar donors to a supportive super PAC and raised larger checks into a campaign committee restructured to accommodate larger donations.\n\nThe reports, filed with the Federal Election Commission, depict a well-positioned Romney fundraising network that seems to be thriving in the new big-money era. Bob Biersack, a leading campaign finance tracker, noted that the mega-donors' impact has expanded this year due to their ability to donate to candidates, parties, joint committees, and outside groups focused on the candidate of their choice.\n\nGOP super PACs, including Restore Our Future and American Crossroads, reported substantial fundraising in May, with Restore Our Future raising $5 million and American Crossroads raising $4.6 million. Notable repeat donors to the super PACs included Pennsylvania medical executive Rocco Ortenzio, Idaho vitamin executive Frank VanderSloot, and a company controlled by Dallas developer Harlan Crow, who collectively donated $1.6 million last month.\n\nHowever, Wednesday's reports do not fully reflect the efforts to attract new donors who previously wrote big checks to Romney's GOP opponents, such as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who pledged $10 million this month, and is also expected to donate significantly to American Crossroads' nonprofit sister group.\n\nDemocrats have been concerned for months about their inability to match the fundraising prowess of Restore Our Future and a constellation of GOP-allied outside groups. They received some good news on Wednesday, as the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action reported raising $4 million in May, marking a significant improvement. This increase came largely from three new donors who gave $1 million each in May: developer Franklin Haney, Houston lawyer Steve Mostyn, and philanthropist Barbara Stiefel.\n\nDespite this, Priorities USA Action's $18.6 million total for the cycle still lags behind Restore Our Future's $61.5 million. The reports also highlight the mega-donors' growing influence beyond super PACs, into the hard money world of campaign committees.",
    " Title: The Untold Story of Thanksgiving: A Historical Perspective on the Early Relationship Between Native Americans and European Settlers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe celebration of Thanksgiving, a holiday deeply rooted in American culture, often paints a picture of harmony and unity between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. However, a closer look at history reveals a far more complex and troubling narrative.\n\nAfter the visits of Samuel de Champlain and Captain John Smith in the early 1600s, a terrible illness spread among the Native American communities, which modern scholars argue was likely leptospirosis, a disease caused by Old World bacteria that had probably arrived through the feces of rats on European ships. This weakening of the native population by disease from the new arrivals' ships created an opening for the Pilgrims.\n\nThe celebration in 1621, often romanticized as a friendly turning point, did not mark a continuous annual event. Relations between the Wampanoag and the settlers deteriorated, leading to the Pequot War. In 1637, in retaliation for the murder of a man the settlers believed the Wampanoags killed, they burned a nearby village, killing as many as 500 men, women, and children. Following the massacre, William Bradford, the Governor of Plymouth, wrote that for \"the next 100 years, every Thanksgiving Day ordained by a Governor was in honor of the bloody victory, thanking God that the battle had been won.\"\n\nJust 16 years after the Wampanoag shared that meal, they were massacred. This was just one of the earliest episodes in which settlers and colonists did something horrible to the natives. There would be other massacres and many wars.\n\nFrom the time Europeans arrived on American shores, the frontier\u2014the edge territory between white man's civilization and the untamed natural world\u2014became a shared space of vast, clashing differences that led the U.S. government to authorize over 1,500 wars, attacks, and raids on Indians, the most of any country in the world against its indigenous people.\n\nThis says nothing of all the treaties brokered and then broken or all the grabbing of land, removing populations, including the most famous removal of natives: the Trail of Tears. Beginning in 1831, tens of thousands of Native Americans were forced to relocate from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. Many died along the way.\n\nAs we gather around our tables this Thanksgiving, it is essential to remember the complex history that underlies this holiday. While we celebrate the shared meal, it is crucial to acknowledge the hardships and injustices that the Native American communities endured, and to honor their resilience and contributions to our nation's history.",
    " Title: Former President Obama Criticizes Trump Administration's Response to Covid-19, Addresses Racial Inequality and Ahmaud Arbery Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare break from tradition, former President Barack Obama delivered a scathing critique of the Trump administration's response to the Covid-19 pandemic during speeches to graduating students of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and high school students on Saturday.\n\nObama's comments, which were a departure from his usual avoidance of direct criticism of his successor, came amid dual crises - one a pandemic disproportionately affecting people of color in the US, and another born from the economic impacts of attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns.\n\n\"More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing. A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge,\" Obama said during the HBCU speech.\n\nIn a second virtual speech on Saturday evening for graduating US high school students, Obama said, \"Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy - that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way - which is why things are so screwed up.\"\n\nObama's comments were preceded by speeches and performances by musicians, actors, and entertainers such as Steve Harvey, Anthony Hamilton, Doug E Fresh, Wyclef Jean, Common, Kevin Hart, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and Vivica A Fox.\n\nThe former president's comments on the pandemic and its disproportionate impact on communities of color were not limited to the HBCU speech. He also addressed the high-profile killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger who was shot and killed after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia.\n\n\"We see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn't submit to their questioning,\" said Obama.\n\nThe former president's remarks come as the US grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 88,000 people in the United States, and the economic fallout from attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns. So far, there have been 1.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US.\n\nObama's comments were met with criticism from some members of the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, a top economic adviser to the president, said he was \"glad Mr Obama has a new job as Joe Biden's press secretary.\" Biden, Obama's former vice president, is running against Trump for president.\n\nDespite the criticism, Obama's remarks were a rallying cry for new graduates, who are being asked to find their way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession.\n\n\"If the world's going to get better, it's going to be up to you,\" said Obama. \"These aren't normal times. You're being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession.\"\n\nObama also used the circumstances of the online graduation as a rallying cry for new graduates, saying, \"You now join the ranks of national and world leaders, influencers.\"\n\nThe former president's remarks were not limited to the pandemic and its disproportionate impact on communities of color. He also addressed the recent high-profile killings of black people by police, looming large in the virtual event, itself necessitated by the shutdown of large gatherings to stem the spread of the disease.\n\n\"These aren't normal times. You're being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession,\" said Obama. \"But you know what else we know? You're going to make us all proud.\"",
    " Title: New York Terror Attack: Investigation Ongoing as Note Referencing Islamic State Found at Scene\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a tragic terrorist attack in New York City on Tuesday, investigators have found a note at the scene that references Islamic State, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The incident occurred when a man drove a rented truck down a popular cycle path, resulting in eight fatalities and 11 injuries.\n\nThe man, who is currently in critical but stable condition in a New York City hospital, was shot by police after driving the truck for approximately a mile on the west side of Manhattan's bike lane. The stretch of the cycle path near the site of the 9/11 attack remains sealed off, with mangled bicycles and the truck still present at the scene.\n\nThe attack, which is the highest death toll from a terrorist incident in the city since 9/11, has left some rattled nerves despite statements of defiance from public officials and displays of resilience in the city. In a separate incident on Wednesday morning, a gun incident in the East Village in Manhattan left two people injured.\n\nThe suspect in the attack is 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, a national of Uzbekistan who immigrated to the US in 2010 and was a driver for the car service Uber, living in New Jersey. The president of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has sent his condolences to President Donald Trump and offered his country's assistance in investigating the attack.\n\nInvestigators are continuing to gather evidence and interview witnesses, with the FBI and police urging members of the public to provide any photos or video that could help in the investigation. The note found at the scene, reportedly mentioning ISIS, is a key piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Propose Economic Stimulus Packages and Universal Basic Income Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the growing economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, multiple lawmakers have proposed economic stimulus packages and universal basic income programs. On Friday, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a 2020 presidential candidate, introduced a resolution that would provide a monthly income of $1,000 to every American until the COVID-19 public health emergency subsides.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed travel bans on several countries hardest-hit by the pandemic, and numerous large events and conferences have been canceled or postponed. The stock market experienced its worst losses since 1987 on Thursday, but the exact number of workers affected remains uncertain.\n\nLast week, Republicans and Democrats united to enact $8.3 billion in emergency funding, primarily dedicated to healthcare concerns arising from the crisis. A second round of relief, set to receive a House vote on Friday, focuses on the economic fallout, providing financial assistance to those most directly affected by the outbreak. The bill expands unemployment insurance, extends paid sick leave for workers forced to stay home, and offers food aid to low-income children due to school closures. It also aims to provide free coronavirus testing for everyone showing symptoms, including the uninsured.\n\nHowever, some members argue that a universal basic income is necessary to prevent lasting economic damage. \"The coronavirus pandemic has created a threat to the health and well-being of the American people, as well as to our country's economic stability,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"While some in Washington are focused on taking care of Wall Street, everyday Americans get left behind. That's wrong...Taking care of all Americans will stimulate our economy during this downturn.\"\n\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini supported the idea in a tweet on Friday, suggesting it be financed with bonds and monetized by the Federal Reserve.\n\nOn Friday, Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.) and Tim Ryan (Ohio) introduced legislation to establish an emergency Earned Income Tax Credit. The bill would provide a payment of $1,000 and $6,000 to the over a third of Americans who earned less than $65,000 last year.\n\n\"In order to alleviate the economic fallout of the Coronavirus, we must ensure hard-working Americans have money in their pockets and are able to pay their bills,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"We must soften the blow for workers as large gatherings and events are canceled and hours are cut. A payroll tax cut is not sufficient.\"",
    " Title: Is Joe Biden the New Hillary Clinton or George W. Bush? A Comparative Analysis of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Joe Biden kicks off his 2020 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, questions about his political identity have surfaced. Matt Continetti, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, poses the question, \"Is Biden the new Hillary?\"\n\nThe comparison between Biden and Clinton, or Bush, is not straightforward. Biden, a seasoned politician, is distinct from both Clinton and Bush. The question, however, highlights the strategies that both political parties might employ in the upcoming election.\n\nContinetti suggests that Trump's campaign strategy will mirror his approach to Clinton in 2016. Trump is reportedly positioning Biden as a candidate of entrenched interests, using a long career in politics for familial gain. He will likely highlight Biden's support for policies like the 1994 crime bill and NAFTA, and question his foreign policy credentials, as he did with Clinton.\n\nCurrent polls support this narrative, with Biden leading Trump by 8 points nationally and in crucial states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a recent Quinnipiac poll shows Biden ahead by 11 percentage points.\n\nThe early lead for Biden is significant, as it indicates a potential flaw in the effort to portray him as another Hillary. Clinton ran as an experienced Washington hand, but Trump's attacks, combined with her association with the Obama administration and the Clinton dynasty, proved effective. The same strategy might not work as well against Biden, who is not as polarizing and offers a different political narrative.\n\nWhile Trump's attacks on Clinton were effective, it's important to note that Clinton's campaign was built on a promise of a third Obama term and a restoration of the Clinton dynasty. Trump didn't need to work hard to convince voters to vote against her, as many were already skeptical or hostile towards her.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, occupies a different space psychologically and politically. The conventional wisdom that the early front-runner always loses doesn't always hold true. In 1999, George W. Bush, who dominated the polls, cruised to victory, despite a brief scare from Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nBush's early success was due, in part, to his promise of a Bush restoration and a referendum on the incumbent president and the scandals that defined the end of his administration. Biden's campaign message, while different in context, echoes these themes, promising a return to a more unified, honorable, and dignified presidency.\n\nWhile Biden can still make mistakes, as he has in the past, the early lead suggests that he is resonating with a significant portion of the Democratic electorate, particularly African-American women who may see in Biden something of an Obama restoration.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are similarities between Biden's campaign and those of Clinton and Bush, the context and political climate are vastly different. Biden's early lead in the polls and his message of unity and restoration could make him a formidable opponent for Trump in the 2020 election. However, the race is long, and much can change between now and the election.",
    " Title: GOP Steps Up Digital Game in Preparation for Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 election, the Republican Party is making a concerted effort to enhance their digital presence and online strategy, as they aim to regain ground in the upcoming midterm elections. The Democratic Party was found to have outperformed the GOP in digital media and advertising during the last election cycle, with President Obama's team spending $52 million compared to Mitt Romney's $26 million.\n\nAccording to a Pew Internet & American Life study, Obama posted four times as much online content as Romney and was active on twice as many digital platforms. The disparity was particularly noticeable on Twitter, where Obama averaged 29 tweets per day compared to Romney's one tweet. Republicans were also outperformed on YouTube, with Democrats publishing two videos for every GOP video.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a repeat of these results, Republican strategists are taking proactive steps to become more competitive. Last week, members of the Republican Party, along with consultants from companies like Facebook and Twitter, gathered in Washington to strategize on building a more effective digital platform. The meeting was led by Romney's digital director, Zac Moffatt, RNC digital director Tyler Brown, and RNC Chief of Staff Jeff Larson.\n\nEric Frenchman, a strategist at Connell Donatelli Inc., who directed over $175 million in online advertising for the 2008 McCain-Palin presidential bid, emphasized the importance of allocating sufficient funds to compete with the already tech-savvy Democratic team. Frenchman suggested that money should be spent earlier in the process and that it's crucial to have a well-prepared digital team in place.\n\nThe Republican Party's digital shortcomings during the 2012 election were highlighted by the slow response to developments in the race. For instance, there were no changes made to the Romney campaign's website following his strong performance in the first debate, and a Google search during the campaign led viewers to an Obama campaign ad when Rep. Paul Ryan was added to the ticket.\n\nThe Obama campaign, on the other hand, used their website, emails, and text messages to push their message, and developed tools that made it easier to donate online, assemble groups for canvassing, and volunteer for field operations in swing states. They also created an app that helped supporters find their Facebook friends in battleground states and reminded them to vote, and provided a link on Facebook to help supporters find voting locations.\n\nThe Republican Party has announced that they will hand over their digital files, which include data on 1 million new voters, to the RNC. The goal is to learn from past mistakes and to build a more robust digital strategy for the future.",
    " Title: GOP Gridlock: The Impact of Poor Candidate Selection on the Republican Legislative Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint news conference on Capitol Hill on February 14, 2018, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy discussed the Republican legislative agenda for the remainder of the year. The Washington Post reports that the agenda is sparse, with the $1.3 trillion spending bill signed into law last month being the last significant legislation to pass Congress before the November elections.\n\nThe House is expected to take a largely symbolic vote on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and attempt to reverse some spending while also finalizing a banking deregulation bill and drafting legislation to address the opioid crisis. The Senate, meanwhile, is likely to focus on confirming President Trump's nominees, including more judges and the president's picks to lead the State Department and the CIA following last month's Cabinet shuffle.\n\nThe irony of House Republicans calling for a balanced-budget amendment after passing a deficit-financed tax cut and a budget-busting omnibus bill is not lost. The lack of significant legislation for the rest of the year is disappointing, especially considering the years of campaigning against liberal policies.\n\nThe Senate filibuster is not entirely to blame for the legislative stalemate. While it creates a barrier for many types of legislation, the process of budget reconciliation allows a 51-vote majority to change policies related to spending and taxes. However, Republicans are declining to pursue this option in 2018.\n\nThe root cause of the legislative stalemate can be traced back to the various maladies and mistakes of state Republican parties across the country. The GOP has lost eminently winnable Senate races over the past decade, allowing Senate Democrats to pad their caucus.\n\nIf we examine the Senate from a partisan perspective, most seats make sense, with strongly Democratic states electing two Democrats and strongly Republican states electing two Republicans. Purple states, such as Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, have one Democrat and one Republican. However, the deviations do not always hold, with New Hampshire having two Democrats and Iowa having two Republicans.\n\nThe main exception to this is a group of six Senate Democrats who come from strongly Republican states. These senators are Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Tester of Montana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The only Republican from a strongly Democratic state is Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nCandidate effects explain many of these Democratic-held seats. Jones, Donnelly, and McCaskill won their races because their Republican opponents said or did outrageous things that alienated the broad middle of their states. Tester and Heitkamp are still in office because their opponents, while not ridiculously bad, ran lackluster campaigns in 2012, failing to win despite the boost they received from Mitt Romney's winning their respective states with ease. Among the six, only Manchin, a former governor, had the sort of reputation that could inoculate him from a strong Republican campaign to oust him.\n\nThe failure to select good candidates and missed opportunities have cost the GOP seat after seat. The responsibility does not lie with McConnell and the Beltway establishment, but with Republican voters and leaders in these states. They failed to select good candidates, and now the party is paying the price.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Romney's Medicare Pay Cuts Claim: A Closer Look at the Affordable Care Act and Physician Fees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding healthcare and the presidential campaign, Republican Mitt Romney has been making a claim about Medicare pay cuts that has raised questions about its accuracy. The claim, which has become a staple in Romney's stump speeches, suggests that Medicare reductions included in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) are responsible for a decrease in Medicare patients being accepted by doctors.\n\nHowever, Harold Pollack, a professor of public health policy at the University of Chicago, has expressed confusion over Romney's arguments, stating, \"I'm honestly rather baffled at the arguments that Governor Romney is making.\"\n\nWhile it is true that the Affordable Care Act does envision reductions in Medicare, these reductions are not directly linked to the decrease in Medicare patients. The issue of Medicare pay for doctors predates the passage of the health law by more than a decade, according to Pollack.\n\nEvery year, Congress has to address the issue of Medicare fees through a process known as the \"doctor fix\" to prevent a significant reduction in fees. This process is unrelated to the Affordable Care Act, as the health reform does not cut physician fees.\n\nIn fact, the nation's doctors were disappointed that the health law did not address the doctor fee problem when it was passed in 2010, as it would have been too expensive. This is why Congress is still grappling with the issue today.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act did take steps to boost payments for some doctors, particularly primary care providers, in both Medicare and the Medicaid program, where the shortage of doctors has been more acute.\n\nA campaign email pointed to a 2010 survey of doctors by the Physicians Foundation, in which 30% said the law would prompt them to close their practices to new Medicare patients. However, the survey had a response rate of only 2.4%, and more than two-thirds of those who responded started with a self-described negative view of the law.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Affordable Care Act does include reductions in Medicare, these reductions are not directly linked to the decrease in Medicare patients being accepted by doctors. The issue of Medicare pay for doctors is a long-standing one that predates the health law, and Congress continues to address it through the \"doctor fix\" process.",
    " Title: Tom Perez Elected as New Democratic National Committee Chair, Signaling Shift in Party's Identity and Strategy\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has elected Tom Perez as their new party chair on Saturday, marking a significant shift in the party's leadership and strategy. Perez, a former Obama administration labor secretary, secured 235 votes, edging out Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) who received 200 votes.\n\nPerez, the son of Dominican immigrants, will be the first Latino to hold the position. As the DNC chair, Perez will lead the party's organizing, messaging, and fundraising operations, playing a crucial role in redefining the Democrats' identity and pitch to voters following their shock loss in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe DNC chair election comes at a time when the Democrats are in a state of political transition, having lost significant ground in the Senate, House, governorships, and state legislatures since 2009. Several candidates, including Perez, campaigned on a promise to focus more on down-ballot races and ramp up small-donor fundraising.\n\nOne of the key challenges for Perez will be interpreting national demographic trends and translating them into Democratic strategy. Some Democrats argue that the party needs to target more progressive white voters, often referred to as \"Bernie voters,\" who were skeptical of Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Demographic trends, they argue, favor the Democrats, with a growing minority and Millennial voter base.\n\nHowever, others argue that these demographic shifts may not be as straightforward as they seem. Lanae Erickson Hatalsky and Jim Kessler of the centrist think tank Third Way suggest that changes are concentrated in urban Democratic strongholds, and that voters cast ballots across parties more often than believed. They also point out that the rising proportion of voters who identify as liberal is offset by a corresponding rise in conservative-identifying voters.\n\nPerez's election to the post may come as a surprise to some, as Rep. Ellison was expected to prevail, partly as a concession to the progressive wing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a backer of Ellison, had framed the choice as one between the \"failed status quo\" and a \"fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nThe election of Tom Perez as the new DNC chair signals a shift in the party's strategy and identity. With four years until the next presidential election, Perez will have the opportunity to implement his vision and guide the party through a period of political transition.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Seeks Information on Potential Surveillance by Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that raises questions about potential politicization of U.S. intelligence agencies, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has formally requested information from the White House and the U.S. intelligence community regarding any surveillance activities conducted on him during the Obama administration.\n\nThe senator, known for his criticism of intelligence programs that collect metadata on innocent Americans, expressed his concerns in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Friday. He tweeted to his 1.2 million followers, \"I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community.\"\n\nPaul's tweet continued, \"Did the Obama admin use warrantless \u2018wiretapping\u2019 on other candidates besides @RealDonaldTrump? Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?\"\n\nThe senator told Breitbart that several individuals have approached him with allegations of such surveillance. He stated, \"We\u2019ve had several people come to us and say that it happened. I don\u2019t have access to that information, but I\u2019ve been very concerned that too many Americans\u2019 information is being culled through without a warrant. I don\u2019t have any facts to say it happened. But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen, so I want to search through, find out why I wasn\u2019t notified. Was it on purpose?\"\n\nThe senator's request follows a report that NSA officials honored nearly 2,000 \"unmasking\" requests in 2016. Paul told Breitbart, \"We have several sources telling us that members of the Obama administration were looking at politicians, particularly [those] who were running for office.\"\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey has previously denied that the Trump campaign was directly targeted by the Obama administration. The allegations made by Sen. Paul are a developing story and further information is expected to emerge in the coming days.",
    " Title: Tlaib Rejects Israel's Offer to Visit Grandmother Due to Restrictive Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nRashida Tlaib, the U.S. Democratic House member, has declined Israel's offer to visit her grandmother in the West Bank, citing the restrictive conditions as contradicting her beliefs in fighting against racism, oppression, and injustice.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Tlaib stated, \"Silencing me & treating me like a criminal is not what she wants for me. It would kill a piece of me. I have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in.\"\n\nIsrael's decision to allow Tlaib to see her grandmother came after she agreed, in a letter, not to re-state her support for a boycott of Israel during the visit. This was a condition Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had laid out. However, after Tlaib indicated she would reject the offer, Israel's Interior Minister Aryeh Deri questioned the sincerity of her visit intentions.\n\nIn a statement, Deri said, \"I approved her request as a gesture of good will on a humanitarian basis, but it was just a provocative request, aimed at bashing the State of Israel.\"\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, called the trip, supposed to start this weekend, \"nothing more than an effort to fuel the BDS engine,\" referring to the \"boycott, divestment and sanctions\" movement against Israel over the country's treatment of Palestinians.\n\nThe decision to block the visit reversed a previous announcement in July, from Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, that Israel would permit the women to enter out of respect for Congress.\n\nTlaib's decision to reject the offer and her subsequent statement sparked criticism from Democrats and at least one Republican, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The staunchly pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee also expressed support for the two lawmakers to visit.\n\nTlaib's family and her deep desire to see her grandmother potentially for the last time were not political bargaining chips, she said in a statement from her congressional office. \"When I won the election to become a United States congresswoman, many Palestinians, especially my grandmother, felt a sense of hope, a hope that they would finally have a voice,\" Tlaib said. \"I can not allow the Israeli government to take that away from them.\"",
    " Title: US-Russia Summit: Trump and Putin Meet in Helsinki, Discussing a Wide Range of Topics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant diplomatic move, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a face-to-face meeting in Helsinki, Finland, marking the first formal summit between the two leaders. The meeting, which was described by Trump as a \"good start,\" followed two hours of closed-door talks and a working lunch with their senior advisers.\n\nRelations between Russia and the West have been strained due to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, a claim Russia strongly denies. The summit comes after a series of contentious exchanges between the two nations, with Trump and Putin previously criticizing each other's policies and actions.\n\nBefore the summit, Trump expressed hope for an \"extraordinary relationship\" and blamed US-Russia tensions on previous administrations. The meeting was met with criticism from some US politicians who called for its cancellation following the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for hacking the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, Trump defended the summit, placing the blame for the deterioration in relations with Russia on \"years of US foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt.\" The tweets, which were likely to alarm White House advisers, were a reflection of Trump's long-standing stance on the investigation into Russian election interference, which he has consistently denounced as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe two leaders were joined only by their interpreters during their two hours of face-to-face talks. The summit follows a tumultuous European tour for Trump, during which he sharply criticized longstanding allies of the US over trade and military spending.\n\nRussia has been criticized in the US for its military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, as well as its destabilizing actions in Ukraine. Relations have also been damaged by accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election and Trump campaign collusion in the effort, allegations that are being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in Helsinki, a city that has served as a meeting spot for the two superpowers due to Finland's politically and militarily neutral stance during the Cold War. The city was the backdrop for the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries.\n\nDuring the joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump elaborated on what would be discussed at the summit, stating, \"We'll be talking about Syria... We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East... I will be talking about nuclear proliferation.\"\n\nThe summit also provided an opportunity for Trump to address other pressing issues, such as the poisoning of two people in the UK who came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok on 30 June. Investigators believe the incident is linked to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in March.\n\nTrump's European tour included a NATO summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy, with Trump's comments on trade deals, immigration, and NATO spending drawing criticism from European leaders and citizens. The summit in Helsinki marks the conclusion of Trump's European tour, and the outcome of the meeting remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Trump Issues Executive Order Temporarily Halting Some Green Card Applications Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that temporarily blocks some foreigners from obtaining U.S. permanent residency, a move he said would protect American workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The order, however, does not constitute a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.\n\nThe executive order, which takes effect just before midnight on Thursday and lasts 60 days, blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the country by obtaining what is informally known as a \"green card.\" The measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.\n\nThe order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas. Foreigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.\n\nThe immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform \"essential\" work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.\n\nThe measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence. The order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21.\n\nThe suspension will be reviewed after 60 days, and Trump will decide whether to extend it. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week. The order also states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs, including guest worker programs, to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.\n\nTrump's latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a \"Muslim ban.\"\n\nFederal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January. Some legal experts argue the high court's ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump's latest order to be challenged in court.\n\nThe United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration. In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.\n\nAmid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday. The number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy, and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\"The idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,\" he said.",
    " Title: Al-Qaeda Threatens U.S. in Video Showing American Hostage Luke Somers; Obama Administration Faces Calls Not to Negotiate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling development, al-Qaeda's Yemen branch has issued a three-day ultimatum to the U.S. government, threatening unspecified consequences for American hostage Luke Somers, a photojournalist who has been held captive since 2013. The video, which bears a striking resemblance to hostage videos released by the Islamic State group, has sparked speculation that it may have prompted the U.S. administration to reveal a failed rescue mission last month.\n\nThe video, first reported by SITE Intelligence Group, shows Mr. Somers, who is a British-born American citizen, pleading for help. In the 3-minute video, Mr. Somers, who has been working in Yemen since 2011, asks for assistance and expresses his fear for his life. Al-Qaeda commander Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, who appears in the video, criticizes U.S.-led airstrikes against the Islamic State group and President Obama for his \"latest foolish action,\" referring to the \"failed operation\" in Hadramawt.\n\nAl-Ansi does not specify the demands but says Washington is \"aware\" of them. He warns the U.S. against future attempts to rescue hostages, stating that if the U.S. does not meet al-Qaeda's demands within three days, \"the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate.\"\n\nThe White House and Pentagon confirmed that President Obama had personally authorized the failed mission to rescue Mr. Somers, who was the lone American among roughly a dozen hostages held by al-Qaeda in Yemen. The operation, which was coordinated with the Yemeni government, resulted in the rescue of six Yemenis, a Saudi, and an Ethiopian.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, has warned the administration to proceed carefully and assertively in the Somers case. McCaul, a Texas Republican, expressed concern that the administration's decision to authorize the release of five former high-level Taliban officials from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an American held hostage in Afghanistan for five years, set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\"The Obama administration must not waver from the United States' long-standing policy of not negotiating with terrorists,\" McCaul said. \"AQAP's latest threat against an American hostage reflects the unrelenting and pervasive brutality of Islamist extremist groups who are at war with the West. We must send a clear message to extremists: 'We will not negotiate with you. We will do everything in our power to stop you and bring you to justice.'\"",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont is seeking to regain momentum in his presidential campaign this weekend, aiming to win three of the four state Democratic contests, with the Michigan primary on Tuesday being a crucial test.\n\nOn Saturday, preliminary results indicated that Mr. Sanders was on track to achieve his goals. The Kansas Democratic Party declared Mr. Sanders the winner in the state's caucuses, and multiple news reports showed him leading in Nebraska. With 79 percent of the vote in from Nebraska, Mr. Sanders was at 55 percent to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 45 percent.\n\nMr. Sanders' team is also targeting a win in Maine on Sunday. As expected, Mrs. Clinton won Louisiana on Saturday, where about half of the electorate is black. Mrs. Clinton has been dominating in the polls with black voters, with more than 80 percent of them voting for her.\n\nMr. Sanders, on the other hand, has performed well in states with largely white populations who identify with his populist economic message. In the seven states he has won, they all rank among the 18 whitest in the country.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Sanders reaffirmed his commitment to taking his campaign all the way to the convention.\n\n\"We have now won double-digit victories from New England to the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains to the Midwest,\" he said in a statement. \"Democrats in Kansas today added to a column of double-digit victories in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\"\n\n\"We have the momentum,\" he said. \"We have a path toward victory. Our campaign is just getting started, and we are going all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\"\n\nDemocrats had 109 delegates at stake Saturday night, and Mr. Sanders needed to capture a majority of them to have a viable path to the White House. After Saturday night's contests, Mrs. Clinton led Mr. Sanders 1,104 to 446 in the delegate race. Either candidate needs 4,763 to win the party nomination.\n\nAfter the Super Tuesday contests, where Mr. Sanders lost seven of the 11 caucuses and primaries to Mrs. Clinton\u2014six of which were held in the south\u2014his campaign made winning Nebraska, Kansas, and Maine a priority.\n\nMr. Sanders' first campaign stop after the March 1 contests was in Maine, and more than one-fifth of his advertisement spending since Super Tuesday has been dedicated to Kansas and Nebraska. Both states have embraced his authenticity, the fact that he's not beholden to corporate interests, and his proposal for debt-free university as reasons to rally for him.\n\nIn Nebraska, where Democrats but not Republicans held county caucuses, big crowds and long lines were reported outside caucus locations Saturday in the greater Omaha and Lincoln areas.\n\nKaitlin Heavin of Omaha was one of many young Sanders supporters who dominated the Sarpy County Caucus at Platteview High School in rural Springfield.\n\n\"I don't hate Hillary, but I don't love her either,\" said Ms. Heavin, who wore a Sanders T-shirt. \"I love Bernie.\"\n\nHer friend Kim Anthony of Millard, who has two children with graduate degrees and hefty loans to show for it, cited Mr. Sanders' stance on reducing student debt.\n\n\"I know he can't do everything, but if he can just do some of what he's talking about, he can get us on the right path,\" Ms. Anthony said.\n\nIn Kansas, Mr. Sanders held a pre-caucus rally in the liberal stronghold of Lawrence with the aim of attracting voters. Although Mrs. Clinton had establishment support in the state with the backing of former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Sanders' supporters were able to overcome it.\n\nWith weekend wins, Mr. Sanders is looking to head into March 8 with momentum, as delegate-rich Michigan is up for grabs. Mr. Sanders' advisers have said his path to the nomination involves winning in industrial Midwestern states and targeting states like New York and California where many delegates are up for grabs.\n\nBoth candidates have been campaigning heavily in Michigan, and spent the weekend there. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton will debate in Flint, Michigan. Mrs. Clinton requested to debate in the city to highlight the poisoned water crisis. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have said if the city wasn't predominantly black and poor, the crisis may have never happened.\n\nMr. Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver told reporters the team feels good about their chances in Michigan.\n\n\"I think his message on trade in particular will be very powerful out there,\" Mr. Weaver said after his team's March 1 losses on the path ahead. \"He has been a consistent opponent of the kind of job-gutting trade deals that Secretary Clinton has consistently supported for decades. And I think there will be some serious questions that will have to be answered by the Clinton campaign about why people should vote for a candidate who has voted for the type of trade deals that have gutted the economy in Michigan, Ohio, and other places.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Steps Down from Politics, but Speculation on Future Bid Remains\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) \u2013 Despite Hillary Clinton's repeated assertions that she has retired from politics, speculation about a potential 2016 bid for the White House persists. In an interview with Marie Claire magazine, Clinton reiterated her intention to step away from politics, laughing off questions about a potential presidential run.\n\n\"I have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years,\" Clinton said. \"It has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience. But I really want to just have my own time back. I want to just be my own person. I'm looking forward to that.\"\n\nClinton expressed hope for the day when an American woman would be elected president, stating, \"That would be a great experience for me, to be up there cheering.\" A search for \"Hillary Clinton for President\" and \"2016\" on Google yields over 4 million hits, including several \"Hillary for 2016\" Facebook pages.\n\nDespite her current stance, Clinton's supporters remain hopeful that she will reenter politics after her term as Secretary of State ends. In a February interview, Clinton told the author that politics was in her DNA.\n\nAlthough a polarizing political figure before taking the job as secretary of state, Clinton has largely been immune to criticism during her tenure. She remains the most popular member of the Obama administration and one of the most popular people in the world.\n\nHowever, the brutal attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, has raised questions about Clinton's leadership. In a CNN interview this week, Clinton attempted to quell the political firestorm surrounding the attack, which has become a campaign issue and has made President Obama vulnerable.\n\n\"I take responsibility,\" Clinton said. \"I'm in charge of the State Department, 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president certainly would not be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\"\n\nAlthough the main target of Republican attacks has been President Obama, Secretary Clinton was asked whether there was a subtle effort to undermine her chances for 2016.\n\n\"That is just so far from anything that anybody should be thinking about,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton has been surrounded by a loyal cadre of staff, known collectively as \"Hillaryland,\" whom she has either known for years or who have worked with her since she was first lady. Last summer, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Clinton's former director of policy planning, caused a stir among State Department ranks when she wrote a controversial cover story in The Atlantic, entitled \"Why Women Still Can't Have It All,\" about her decision to quit Clinton's staff due to the challenges of juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys.\n\nWhen asked about the piece by Marie Claire, Clinton was forthright, pointing out that Slaughter's problems were her own. \"Some women are not comfortable working at the pace and intensity you have to work at in these jobs... Other women do not break a sweat. They have four or five, six kids. They're highly organized, they have very supportive networks,\" Clinton said. \"By all accounts, this was precisely the kind of mother Clinton was to Chelsea\u2014hands-on, prioritizing her child, and yet ever committed to work.\"\n\nClinton has little patience for those whose privilege offers them a myriad of choices but who fail to take advantage of them. \"I can't stand whining,\" she says. \"I can't stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they're not happy with the choices they've made. You live in a time when there are endless choices... Money certainly helps, and having that kind of financial privilege goes a long way, but you don't even have to have money for it. But you have to work on yourself... Do something!\"",
    " Title: An Examination of the Complex Relationship Between America and Russia: A Closer Look at the Perceptions and Realities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the intricate dance of global politics, the relationship between America and Russia has long been a subject of intense debate and speculation. Recent events have brought this relationship into sharp focus, with allegations of Russian involvement in various international incidents, from the assassination of a former Russian spy on British soil to the annexation of Crimea.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to examine this relationship not through the lens of simplistic narratives, but rather through a nuanced understanding of the complexities that define it.\n\nRussia's actions, such as its annexation of Crimea, its alleged involvement in the downing of a passenger airliner, and its support for political dissidents, have raised concerns about its intentions and its adherence to international norms. On the other hand, Russia's intervention in Syria and its role as a safe haven for political refugees, such as Edward Snowden, demonstrate its continued influence in global affairs.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations is further complicated by historical events, such as the withdrawal of Russia from 700,000 square miles of Europe and Eurasia at the end of the Cold War, and the implementation of economic reforms under Boris Yeltsin's government, which were met with significant backlash within Russia.\n\nThe perception of Russia in America has shifted over time, with political actors often viewing Russia through the prism of their own domestic agendas. This is evident in the changing views of Russia as a geopolitical foe, as exemplified by the comments of Mitt Romney and President Obama in 2012.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations is also influenced by economic factors, with Russian oligarchs playing a significant role in the global financial market, particularly in cities like London and New York.\n\nIt is essential to approach the relationship between America and Russia with a clear-eyed understanding of the complexities that define it. Rather than viewing Russia as a ghost in the Western storyline, it is crucial to recognize it as a nation-state with its own enduring interests, history, and problems.\n\nOnly then can we begin to engage in a dialogue that is both intelligent, realistic, and honest, and move towards a more constructive relationship between the two nations.",
    " Title: The Limits of Presidential Influence on the U.S. Economy: A Neutral Analysis of Donald Trump's Economic Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump's economic proposals have been a significant part of his campaign, with promises of job creation, revitalizing manufacturing, and making America great again. However, a closer look at these promises reveals a gap between rhetoric and reality.\n\nIn an economic speech in Detroit last month, Trump claimed he would \"jump-start America,\" a statement that, according to economists, is unlikely to materialize. On Thursday, Trump made bold claims about his policies creating 25 million jobs over the next decade. However, these claims are met with skepticism from economists such as John Cochrane of the free market Hoover Institution at Stanford University and Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the conservative American Action Forum, who argue that Trump is \"over-counting what he could get.\"\n\nThe economy is subject to numerous unpredictable factors, and presidents have limited control over it. The growth in China, oil production in Saudi Arabia, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and unforeseen events such as terrorism, natural disasters, war, and financial crises can all have ripple effects in the U.S. Demographic changes at home also play a role, and no one has more direct influence on the economy than Janet Yellen and her fellow Federal Reserve governors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been using low-interest rates and expansionary monetary policy to stimulate growth, but growth has lagged. The Fed's inability to unleash inflation, even to the 2 percent it regards as optimal, raises questions about the potency of a president's economic policies. Presidents face constraints, such as the need for legislation to enact major policy changes, and the approval of lawmakers for spending and revenue decisions. These decisions are also subject to the ups and downs of the economy.\n\nThe economy's response to policy changes is not always predictable, as demonstrated by the weak growth under Barack Obama despite a big stimulus package, and the surge in federal deficit during the 2008 recession, which was not a result of President George W. Bush's decision to nearly triple the deficit.\n\nTrump's promise to create a net total of 25 million jobs qualifies as utterly preposterous, given that the longest peacetime expansion in American history, which occurred under President Bill Clinton, fell short of that feat. The next president will face headwinds, such as sluggish growth abroad, an aging population, and an immigration slowdown, that Clinton did not.\n\nThe most important economics book of 2016, Robert Gordon's \"The Rise and Fall of American Growth,\" makes an exhaustive case that the huge improvements in living standards during the 20th century were a unique phenomenon that cannot be repeated. Gordon contends that America is riding on a slow-moving turtle, and there is little that politicians can do about it.\n\nWhile Trump's economic proposals may appeal to some, it is essential to recognize the limits of presidential influence on the economy. The economy is a complex system influenced by numerous factors, and presidents have limited control over it. It is crucial to approach economic policy with a realistic understanding of its limitations and the role of unpredictable factors.",
    " Title: Mitch McConnell's Victory Over Tea Party Challenger Highlights Incumbent Advantage in GOP Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 primary season, the once-powerful tea party movement has been dealt a series of setbacks, with long-serving lawmakers leveraging their incumbency to defeat challengers from the activist right. This trend was particularly evident on Tuesday night, as eight-term Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky all emerged victorious over their tea party opponents.\n\nMcConnell's decisive triumph over Matt Bevin, a Louisville investor, was the most significant victory of the night. Bevin, who drew support from outside groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund and FreedomWorks, was unable to match McConnell's campaign's relentless attack on his record on issues ranging from bank bailouts to cockfighting.\n\nThe 2014 primary season is shaping up to reassert a long-standing political law: it is extremely difficult to oust a sitting member of Congress who is willing to fight for their seat. McConnell, who has been a senior U.S. senator for over three decades, demonstrated the political muscles and focused ambition that make a person a senior U.S. senator in the first place.\n\nThe cost of winning renomination as a sitting Republican senator has more than doubled since 2002, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. Incumbents facing down foes from the ideological right face an even steeper challenge.\n\nSince the start of the tea party wave in 2010, only a handful of Republican incumbents have lost primaries. Conservative insurgents have scored major successes in open-seat races, but their record against incumbents features fewer big victories. In almost every case, the loser was a lawmaker who either failed to take the challenge seriously or lacked the will to fight.\n\nRepublican campaign committees have put their members on notice at the start of the cycle. Staffers at the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have held briefings and one-on-one meetings with lawmakers to emphasize the importance of working actively to lock down the party nomination.\n\nIn Kentucky, McConnell thoroughly discredited Bevin as a conservative messenger. The GOP leader ran advertisements attacking Bevin for having praised the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailouts while he was a financial executive, and McConnell's campaign manager, Jesse Benton, humiliated Bevin at a conservative rally with a pop quiz about the Constitution that Bevin failed.\n\nElsewhere, in primary fights that are still in progress, incumbents have blunted or broken the momentum of hard-right challengers. In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts has watched a primary challenge from physician Milton Wolf falter and fizzle after revelations that Wolf posted images of X-rayed gunshot victims on his Facebook page. Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran still faces a potentially competitive primary from state Sen. Chris McDaniel, but early fears that Cochran might collapse have faded as McDaniel's record of incendiary statements and inconsistent support for Mississippi's federal priorities has been aired before the voters.",
    " Title: Young Adult Enrollment in ObamaCare Lags Behind Expected Goals, Concerns Rise Among Insurers\n\nArticle:\n\nInsurers have expressed concerns over the low number of young adults signing up for health insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges, as newly released statistics showed that less than a quarter of people who have enrolled are between the ages of 18 and 34. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, only 24 percent \u2013 or 489,460 \u2013 of the 2.2 million people who signed up for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were in the coveted 18-to-34 age range. This means the government has hit only 18 percent of its stated goal of registering 2.7 million adults in the 18-to-34 age range.\n\nExperts have predicted that the program will need roughly 40 percent of enrollees to be in that prime demographic in order to be fiscally solvent. Adults ages 55 to 64 made up 33 percent of the total number of Americans who signed up, the largest group represented in the data.\n\nObamaCare needs so-called 'invincibles' \u2013 healthy young adults \u2013 to sign up in coming months to help offset the costs of older and less healthy enrollees. If that doesn\u2019t happen, insurers could be forced to raise the rates, making the costs and future of ObamaCare uncertain.\n\nMarty Anderson, marketing director for Wisconsin-based Security Health Plan, told the Wall Street Journal, \"This is concerning to us that we're seeing this portion come in so old.\" Allan Einboden, chief executive of Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that the data was \"more negative than we thought it was going to be,\" and added that several requests to pre-authorize surgeries for enrollees in the first days of their coverage had executives worried about costs.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a consultant who works with insurers, told The New York Times, \"You need healthy people of all ages... the program is not ramping up fast enough to guarantee a good balance of healthy and sick people, which you need to sustain the program.\"\n\nAdministration officials, though, were upbeat in describing the numbers Monday. They said they're in a \"solid place,\" and noted that this age group makes up just 26 percent of the general population. Monday\u2019s report was the first time the government has released demographic data on the performance of President Obama\u2019s signature health care overhaul. In all, about 1.8 million people enrolled in new individual health plans through the law in December, bringing the total number of new enrollments between Oct. 1 and Dec.28 to about 2.2 million.\n\n\"There's no way to spin it: youth enrollment has been a bust so far,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, following the release. \"When they see that ObamaCare offers high costs for limited access to doctors \u2013 if the enrollment goes through at all \u2013 it's no surprise that young people are not rushing to sign up.\"\n\nAs analysts have told \u2588\u2588\u2588, insurance companies have said they may want to take advantage of the \"risk pool\" provisions \u2013 which involve the federal government covering 80 percent of any losses associated with an older and unhealthier base of customers.\n\nAccording to HHS, 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance. While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up, 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites.\n\nOf the 2.2 million who have signed up, 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male, HHS said. Individuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace \u2013 bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Sixty percent selected a silver plan, while 20 percent selected a bronze plan, according to HHS.",
    " Title: Johnson & Johnson Settles Ohio Opioid Lawsuit for $20 Million Ahead of Landmark Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nPharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has reached a $20 million settlement with two Ohio counties, marking a significant step in the ongoing opioid crisis litigation. The settlement, which avoids the first in a series of federal trials, is a potential precursor to billions of dollars in payouts to over 2,000 other plaintiffs suing over the opioid epidemic's devastating impact.\n\nThe settlement, between Johnson & Johnson and Cuyahoga and Summit counties, which include Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, was relatively small compared to the anticipated payouts. However, it could pave the way for substantial compensation to other counties, municipalities, and Native American tribes involved in the litigation.\n\nThe Ohio trial, set to begin on October 21, is one of several trials intended to determine the drug industry's liability for the opioid crisis and, if found liable, the amount of compensation due. A second trial is scheduled for West Virginia in January. The outcomes of these and other test cases will inform a broader settlement covering numerous federal lawsuits across the United States.\n\nUntil now, Johnson & Johnson has maintained its innocence in the opioid crisis, refusing to settle similar lawsuits and arguing that it was merely manufacturing a legal drug. However, in August, the company lost a landmark case in Oklahoma, where a judge found Johnson & Johnson instrumental in causing addiction and death through a \"false and dangerous\" sales campaign that contributed to the crisis. The state of Oklahoma sued the company, alleging it ran a \"cunning, cynical, and deceitful scheme\" to mass-market opioid painkillers with false claims of minimal addiction risk. The judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million in the first year of a longer-term settlement.\n\nJohnson & Johnson made no admission of liability in the Ohio settlement and stated that it reached an agreement to direct resources toward addressing the opioid crisis. However, law professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond suggested that the Oklahoma loss may have influenced the company's decision, as it may have reconsidered litigating every case due to potential liability exposure.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Johnson & Johnson will settle with hundreds of other litigants, potentially totaling hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. However, most drug manufacturers have settled as the trial approaches, seemingly wary of the courts ordering larger payouts.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's settlement came days after one of the largest opioid manufacturers, Mallinckrodt, reached a $30 million deal with the two Ohio counties. Two other companies, Endo and Allergan, also agreed to settlements earlier. This leaves only one manufacturer, Teva, still fighting the case alongside pharmacy chain Walgreens and drug distributors, which are among the largest corporations in the US despite their lesser-known names.\n\nThe remaining trial may shine a spotlight on the role of distributors such as Cardinal Health and McKesson, which shipped millions of opioid pills into small communities. Law professor Tobias suggested that this will increase pressure on them to settle before the trial to avoid substantial settlements or large verdicts.\n\nSeparately, Purdue Pharma, the drug-maker that initiated the epidemic with its powerful opioid OxyContin, has reached a tentative deal potentially worth several billion dollars with some states, using bankruptcy to restructure the company as a trust and allocate future profits toward addiction treatment and prevention.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Secures Re-election Amidst Sandy Aid and Fiscal-Cliff Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be on track for re-election as the nation's top Republican on Thursday. Two GOP congressmen, Rep. Mike Grimm of New York and Chris Smith of New Jersey, who earlier had criticized Boehner, have now changed their stance and plan to endorse the Speaker for a second term.\n\nThe shift in support, coupled with a reluctance for any viable candidate to step forward, has led many observers to believe that Boehner is on track for another year as Speaker. One potential hurdle centered around an aid package for victims of Superstorm Sandy, but even that challenge seems to have passed.\n\n\"Whatever's done is done, and that's it,\" declared Rep. Pete King of New York on Wednesday afternoon after a meeting with Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor in which GOP leaders pledged to allow a Friday vote on $9 billion in aid for victims of the record-breaking storm. A second vote on the remaining $51 billion will come on Jan. 15.\n\n\"The bottom line is we need the $60 billion,\" King said. \"We have gotten that solid commitment.\" Earlier Wednesday, King and several other members of the New York-New Jersey congressional delegation had voiced angry words at Boehner for not allowing a vote on the aid to come to the House floor.\n\nHowever, King said later that his anger at Boehner was now in the past. \"As far as I'm concerned, that was a lifetime ago,\" he said after the meeting with Boehner and Cantor, according to the Hill reports. \"The bottom line is we are getting the result that we need.\"\n\nRon Meyer, a spokesman for the conservative group American Majority Action, which was among several calling for Boehner's ouster, acknowledged that House Republicans simply do not have a viable alternative to Boehner. \"It turns out no one else seems willing to pick up the mantle,\" he said on Wednesday. \"I hesitate to say it, but this goes to some degree to cowardice.\"\n\n\"You can't beat somebody with nobody,\" added a senior House Republican to the National Journal on Wednesday.\n\nBoehner's speakership seems all but certain to survive several challenges in recent months. Two weeks ago, dozens of GOP legislators refused to support Boehner's \"Plan B\" fiscal-cliff proposal that would have staved off rising tax rates for most Americans. The party split capped an extensive day of lobbying and arm-twisting of the GOP rank and file, which included a late-night meeting Boehner called to determine whether he had enough votes for approval.\n\nThat not being the case, Majority Leader Cantor announced that no vote would be held\u2014and Boehner himself was spotted leaving the Capitol shortly thereafter. Much of the criticism centered around conservative GOP legislators and outside groups seeing Boehner as too willing to compromise with the White House and Democrats on taxes and other fiscal issues.\n\nLast month, Boehner stripped four Republicans\u2014including three heavily supported by the Tea Party Patriots\u2014from their coveted committee seats. The move created tension within the GOP ranks.\n\nHowever, other conservative groups were joining with American Majority Action to attack Boehner for his support of the fiscal-cliff bill that was negotiated by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, according to the National Journal. Boehner was among just 85 House Republicans ultimately supporting the measure. But Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California voted against it. They were among 151 House GOP members to do so.",
    " Title: White House Maintains Neutral Stance on FBI's Clinton Email Investigation Amidst New Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from the criticism coming from the Clinton campaign and other Democrats, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has taken a neutral stance regarding Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey's decision to announce new developments in the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\n\nMr. Comey revealed on Friday that the FBI was looking into new evidence related to an investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee's email. This news has once again brought Clinton's email troubles, which were thought to be largely behind her, back into the spotlight.\n\nIn remarks in Ohio on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said there was \"no case here\" and questioned the agency's motives in announcing the developments just 11 days before the presidential election. A day earlier, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Mr. Comey of violating a law barring federal officials from using their position to influence an election. In a letter to Mr. Comey, Mr. Reid wrote: \"I led the fight to get you confirmed [by the Senate] because I believed you to be a principled public servant. With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Earnest said President Barack Obama thought Mr. Comey a man of integrity. \"The president believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle and he's a man of good character,\" Mr. Earnest said.\n\nMr. Comey announced in a letter to congressional committee chairmen on Friday that the FBI would look into new emails related to the investigation of Mrs. Clinton. The newly-found emails surfaced as a result of a probe into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-time aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nQ & A: What We Know About the Latest Clinton Email Developments\n- Democrat Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, shared a primary debate question with the Clinton campaign, according to hacked emails.\n- The FBI is investigating new emails related to Hillary Clinton's email server, which were found during an unrelated investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner.\n- The news of the new investigation has once again brought Clinton's email troubles into the spotlight, just 11 days before the presidential election.\n- The Clinton campaign and some Democrats have criticized FBI Director James Comey for announcing the new investigation so close to the election, while the White House has maintained a neutral stance.\n- The FBI is still investigating the emails and has not yet determined whether they contain classified information or are relevant to the investigation.",
    " Title: Christian Leaders Respond to Don Lemon's Controversial Remarks on Jesus' Perfection\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN, anchor Don Lemon asserted that Jesus Christ, whom many believe to be perfect, was not perfect during His time on earth. This statement has sparked a response from several Christian leaders, who have taken to social media to correct Lemon's misinterpretation.\n\nLemon, who identifies as a Baptist and attended a Catholic school, made the comments during a conversation with fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. \"Jesus Christ\u2014if that\u2019s who you believe in, Jesus Christ\u2014admittedly was not perfect when He was here on this earth,\" Lemon said.\n\nThe statement has been met with criticism from Christian leaders, who argue that Jesus' perfection is a central tenet of their faith. Dr. Derwin L. Gray, a pastor based in North Carolina, tweeted at Lemon, \"Good sir, Jesus was perfect. He had no sin. He is the unblemished Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.\" Gray added, \"If you want theological advice, hit me up, please.\"\n\nThe belief in Jesus' perfection is rooted in the substitutionary atonement, a central doctrinal belief that Jesus died for us, granting salvation to those who put their faith in the Son of God. The Bible states that Jesus lived a sinless life while on earth, and that He is \"holy and blameless, unstained by sin\" (Hebrews 7:26).\n\nCatholic teaching, like evangelical Christian theology, affirms that Jesus was \"like us in all things, except sin.\" The Italian priest Thomas Aquinas defined sin as \"an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law.\" Given that God's character is the basis for the eternal law, going against it would be a direct contradiction to His nature, making sin an impossibility for Jesus.\n\nLemon's statement has sparked debate and criticism, with some arguing that he should have known better given his background in Christian doctrine. It remains to be seen if Lemon will address the criticism or issue a correction.",
    " Title: Washington Post Columnists' Sympathetic View of Clinton's Email Scandal Overshadows Critical Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, The Washington Post's Dana Milbank and Ruth Marcus, both Yale-educated columnists, have found themselves writing strikingly similar columns regarding Hillary Clinton's email scandal. Their shared perspective, rooted in a perceived sympathy for Clinton, has led to a significant blind spot in their analysis of the issue.\n\nLast Sunday, both columnists addressed the damaging report from the State Department's Inspector General, which concluded that Clinton's use of a private email server was self-authorized. Despite the implicit criticism in the report and subtle jabs from network newscasts, both columnists downplayed the severity of Clinton's actions, labeling it as a self-inflicted wound rather than a deliberate breach of protocol.\n\nMilbank's column, titled \"Hunkered Hillary made things worse,\" and Marcus's column, with the pull quote \"The Clintonian urge for privacy produces the opposite of what she needs,\" both suggest that Clinton's email scandal is merely a misstep, rather than a potential security risk or breach of transparency.\n\nTheir shared viewpoint is that Clinton does not deserve the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" bestowed upon her by her Republican opponents. Instead, they argue that Clinton is overly cautious and fearful of the so-called \"Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy.\"\n\nMarcus contends that the email scandal was a simple mistake, while Milbank's entire column can be boiled down to the rebuttal of Trump's nickname: \"This isn't quite true: Though investigations into her activities have occupied much of the past 25 years, her accusers, on Whitewater to Benghazi, never really get the goods.\"\n\nHowever, the columnists' portrayal of Clinton's \"accusers\" as politically motivated and the media's role in investigating and holding Clinton accountable as a public servant is questionable. The media, according to these journalists, are only assigned to call Republicans to account, while Clinton's \"instinctive caution\" and relentless lying are allowed to go unchecked.\n\nThe media's handling of the Clinton Foundation, for instance, raises concerns. If a Republican administration had a former president's wife as Secretary of State while accepting huge donations from foreign countries seeking preferential treatment, the media would likely have reacted differently. Yet, the liberal media has allowed the Clinton Foundation to operate with a wink-wink arrangement with the Obama administration, permitting donations from countries that had previously donated, as long as they did not increase their contributions.\n\nFurthermore, the media's coverage of the Clinton Foundation's conflicts of interest has been minimal, with only 27 minutes dedicated in 2015, compared to the 88 minutes spent on Chris Christie's \"Bridgegate\" scandal in two days. This year, the networks have spent less than five minutes on the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn light of these facts, the question remains: why would the Clintons continue to lie and hide evidence if the media is not interested in violating their \"urge for privacy\"? After all, Clinton is running for president. The media's lack of scrutiny and accountability may be contributing to the Clinton's continued evasiveness and lack of transparency.",
    " Title: Major Study on Hydroxychloroquine Retracted, Initial Coverage by CNN and MSNBC Now Called into Question\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a major study on the effects of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients, initially published in The Lancet, has been retracted due to concerns about the validity of the data. The study, led by Mandeep R. Mehra of Harvard Medical School, was published in late May, but was retracted on Thursday due to issues with the data's source and peer-review process.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hill, the study's authors could not access the full dataset used for the analysis, as the source of the data, Surgisphere Corporation, refused to transfer it due to client agreements and confidentiality requirements. The study's retraction follows weeks of questions about its accuracy and ethical issues.\n\nThe initial coverage of the study by CNN and MSNBC on May 22 has come under scrutiny, with both networks devoting significant airtime to the study's claims. CNN spent 90 minutes and 54 seconds discussing the study, while MSNBC dedicated 19 minutes and 19 seconds to the topic. However, coverage of the study's retraction has been minimal, with CNN dedicating only one minute and 45 seconds to the issue, and MSNBC ignoring it altogether.\n\nThe study's retraction raises questions about the accuracy of the initial coverage, as well as the role of media in the dissemination of scientific information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study's authors stated that they entered the collaboration \"to contribute in good faith and at a time of great need during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and expressed their apologies for any embarrassment or inconvenience caused.\n\nThe Lancet, in a statement, took the issue of scientific integrity \"extremely seriously\" and acknowledged that there are \"many outstanding questions about Surgisphere and the data that were allegedly included in this study.\" The study's retraction highlights the importance of peer-review and fact-checking in scientific research, and the need for media outlets to exercise caution and due diligence when reporting on such studies.\n\nThe Guardian reported on June 3 that Surgisphere, the company that provided the data for the study, had questionable hires, including a science fiction writer and an adult-content model. The study's retraction and the subsequent investigation into Surgisphere's practices have cast doubt on the validity of the initial findings and the credibility of the study's authors.\n\nThe study's initial coverage by CNN and MSNBC has been criticized for its one-sided and sensationalist approach, with hosts and guests expressing alarm and concern about the potential dangers of hydroxychloroquine. The study's retraction and the subsequent investigation into its validity highlight the need for media outlets to exercise caution and due diligence when reporting on scientific studies, particularly during a global pandemic.",

The organization aims to focus on key Senate races in the 2014 midterms and engage voters who could tip the balance.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, president of the new outreach and a co-founder of the parent group, which represents around 3,000 local tea party groups, stated, \"Unlike other Super PACs that drop in negative ads from their Washington perches to criticize opponents, we will empower the people to have the most impact in targeted districts and states.\"\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots plan to focus on Senate races in South Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, Arkansas, and North Carolina. In South Carolina, they are looking for an alternative to Sen. Lindsey Graham, and in Kentucky, they are considering Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's challengers.\n\nMartin added, \"We are the only super PAC with tens of thousands of grassroots activists across the country, and we will ensure they have what they need to elect conservatives and hold elected officials accountable.\"\n\nThe organization has also initiated an early-bird presidential straw poll, reflecting the interests of its membership. The candidates include Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.\n\nIntriguing developments are unfolding in the Bluegrass State. According to pollster Scott Rasmussen, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell runs even with Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes in the 2014 U.S. Senate race in Kentucky. However, McConnell's GOP primary rival, Matt Bevin, leads Grimes by six points.\n\nMatt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks for America, a liberty-minded, low-tax group that supports grassroots candidates, declared, \"To beat Grimes in November, we have to ditch Mitch.\" The results of this poll, according to Kibbe, indicate that Bevin has a stronger chance at defeating the Democrat in the general election.",
    " Title: \"The Tax Provisions in the New Amnesty Bill: A Closer Look\"\n\nArticle:\n\nJon Feere, legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, has shed light on the tax requirements in the recently proposed amnesty bill, challenging claims made by amnesty advocates. Contrary to popular belief, the bill does not mandate that illegal immigrants pay back taxes for their years spent working off the books. Instead, it requires illegal immigrants to resolve any existing tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if they have been audited and requested to pay unpaid taxes.\n\nHowever, Feere points out that a significant portion of the estimated 45 percent of illegal immigrants working off the books are not on the IRS's radar, making it highly unlikely they have ever been audited. With the IRS historically auditing only about 1 percent of tax filers, the number of illegal immigrants who have been audited is likely minimal.\n\nThe current tax provision in the bill is not expected to impact the majority of illegal immigrants seeking amnesty, leading to at least one amendment being proposed that would require payment of back taxes for the period during which amnesty applicants have worked illegally in the United States.\n\nMoreover, the bill does not require employers of illegal immigrants to pay FICA taxes for the years they paid illegal immigrants under the table.\n\nThis should not come as a surprise, as a similar situation occurred after the 1986 amnesty became law. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) then snuck a provision into a tax law that barred amnesty adjudicators from sharing the tax information of amnesty applicants with the IRS. Schumer reasoned that such a move would jeopardize the success of the legalization program, as submitting an application could make an alien vulnerable to an enforcement action by the IRS. Similarly, the Bush administration requested that a back-taxes provision be removed from the failed 2007 amnesty bill.",

The Virginia Citizens Defense League took part in a roundtable discussion in the film.\n\nA clip appears to show nine seconds of silence after Couric asks, \"If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\" However, audio released to the Washington Free Beacon reveals that members immediately answered a similar question posed by Couric.\n\nDirector Stephanie Soechtig told The Washington Post that the pause was intended to allow viewers to consider the question. Couric has stated that she supports the film and is \"very proud of the film.\"\n\nHowever, some are furious over the way the film portrays the activists in the documentary. The Independent Women's Forum issued a statement on Wednesday, calling for Couric to be fired.\n\n\"Katie Couric should be ashamed of herself for her dishonest and distorted reporting on this issue,\" said Culture of Alarmism Director Julie Gunlock. \"She has gone from respected journalist to propagandist for gun control groups... Like serial fabricator Brian Williams, Couric should be fired.

    " Title: Canadian Elections 2019: Justin Trudeau Wins Second Term, Falls Short of Majority\n\nArticle:\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secured a second term in Canada's national elections on Monday, despite a series of scandals that tarnished his image and falling short of a majority in Parliament. The Liberal party took the most seats, giving it the best chance to form a government, but the party will have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation.\n\nRobert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, stated, \"Trudeau is prime minister because the rest of the party was able to pull itself together and prevail. While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened, he\u2019s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn\u2019t yet shown.\"\n\nThe results were a victory for Trudeau, whose clean-cut image took a hit after old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month. Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, commented, \"I\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done. I don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority, but they are not that far off.\"\n\nWith results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 156 seats\u201414 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. In his early Tuesday address, Trudeau said, \"Tonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change.\"\n\nThe Canadian vote came down to a choice between Trudeau and Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who was seen as the perfect antidote to Trudeau's flash and celebrity. Scheer, 40, is a career politician who was expected to resign after a dirty campaign and a disappointing election result, according to Robert Bothwell.\n\nAmong other things, Scheer called Trudeau a phony who couldn\u2019t even remember how many times he had worn blackface. In his concession speech, Scheer said, \"Tonight Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice. And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win.\"\n\nTrudeau's Liberals will likely rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. Opposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh said early Tuesday he had congratulated Trudeau and vowed to play a constructive role in Parliament.\n\nThe results left the Conservatives deeply disappointed. Scheer had promised to end a national carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25%. Trudeau embraced immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalized cannabis nationwide.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta's oil to international markets.\n\nTrump, who has clashed with Trudeau over trade, tweeted his congratulations early Tuesday, saying, \"Canada is well served.\" Pat Gill, a Vancouver retiree, said she voted for Trudeau. \"I think people know he\u2019s made some mistakes,\" said Gill, who is 74. \"I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s learned in the last four years.

For some, the festivities revolve around jingle bells, gift exchanges, and the twinkling of Christmas lights. However, for those who hold the practice of their faith dear, the birth of Jesus Christ and the story that surrounds it remains the essence of Christmas.\n\nJay Parini, a poet, novelist, and professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, has delved deeply into the story of Jesus in his book, \"Jesus: The Human Face of God.\" In a recent commentary, Parini emphasizes the importance of keeping Jesus at the heart of the Christmas narrative, as the story of his birth is the reason for the season.\n\nThe story of Jesus' birth is a poignant tale, interwoven with elements of joy and terror. A young family from Galilee arrives in a small town as strangers, with the pregnant mother unable to find a place to rest. Upon the child's birth, the magi, or wise men, travel from the East to worship him, unknowingly alerting a malevolent king to the newborn's existence. The king, fearing the child as a potential rival, orders the slaughter of all male children in an attempt to eliminate the newborn. An angel appears to Joseph, instructing him to flee with his family to Egypt, making Jesus a refugee, seeking safety and a new home.\n\nParini, reflecting on this story, suggests that it would be impossible to imagine Jesus turning his back on refugees. He encourages Christians to embody the message of love and compassion, fighting hatred not only in the time of King Herod but also in the face of contemporary challenges, such as those posed by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nAs the world grapples with the ongoing refugee crisis, Parini's message serves as a timely reminder of the importance of empathy, compassion, and solidarity. The story of Jesus' birth, marked by displacement and the search for a safe haven, offers a powerful reminder of the human condition and the need for love and understanding in the face of adversity.\n\nThis Christmas, as we celebrate the birth of Jesus, let us remember the plight of refugees and the importance of extending a helping hand to those in need. May the message of love and compassion resonate in our hearts and guide us in our interactions with the world around us.",
    " Title: President Obama Discusses Daughters' Unique Upbringing and the Shift in Perception of Wealth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview for the Amazon Kindle store, President Barack Obama discussed the unique upbringing of his daughters, Sasha and Malia, and the steps he takes to ensure they understand the unconventional nature of their lifestyle.\n\nThe White House, with its built-in bowling alley, movie theater, and personal chef, could potentially give the Obama daughters a distorted view of American life. However, the President stated that he and his wife, Michelle, are constantly reminding their daughters of the atypical environment they inhabit and that it is not the norm.\n\nThe President explained that having relatives who do not live like the commander-in-chief, and even struggle to get by, keeps his children grounded. He shared that his daughters have cousins who understand the struggle of making ends meet, and this exposure helps them recognize the worth of those less fortunate.\n\nDuring a visit to an Amazon.com distribution plant in Tennessee on Tuesday, Obama discussed the cultural shift in wealth perception, particularly among children. He noted that, unlike in his childhood, today's kids have a distorted sense of what constitutes a normal life due to the constant exposure to made-for-television wealth.\n\nObama pointed out that traditional benchmarks of success, such as a home, job, education, health care, and retirement, are no longer deemed sufficient. He attributed this shift to the increased visibility of the lifestyles of the rich and famous, citing the Kardashians and Kanye West as examples.\n\nThe President concluded by stating that, in his youth, there was no window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous, and kids were not monitoring the daily fashion choices or vacations of celebrities. He emphasized that this change in perception of wealth and success is a significant cultural shift.",
    " Title: North Korea Conducts Submarine Ballistic Missile Test, Claims Weapon Capable of Striking \"Hostile Forces\"\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has reportedly conducted an underwater test-firing of a submarine ballistic missile (SLBM), according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Saturday. The test, which took place near Sinpo South Shipyard on the east coast, is said to have demonstrated the missile's ability to meet the latest military science and technology requirements.\n\nThe North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, described the missile as a \"world-level strategic weapon\" and an \"eye-opening success,\" according to KCNA. The state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of a projectile rising from the surface and Kim smiling from a distance at what looked like a floating submarine.\n\nThe test reportedly involved a missile launch from underwater, with the missile soaring into the sky. This development is significant as it marks a potential advancement in North Korea's nuclear capabilities, particularly in terms of its ability to launch nuclear strikes from submarines.\n\nExperts in Seoul suggest that North Korea's military demonstrations and hostile rhetoric are attempts to secure concessions from the United States and South Korea, whose officials have recently discussed the possibility of holding preliminary talks to test North Korea's commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn recent years, North Korea has been pushing for resumption of talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The last public U.S. attempt to restart the six-party process, involving China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, North Korea, and the U.S., collapsed in 2012 after the North launched a long-range rocket. Pyongyang conducted its third nuclear test in February 2013, and has test-fired numerous shorter-range missiles since then.\n\nIn January, the U.S. proposed a meeting with North Korea, but the bid failed to gain traction. This week, South Korean envoy Hwang Joon Kook stated, after meeting with his U.S. and Chinese counterparts, that all five parties are ready once again to test North Korea's intentions on talks.\n\nNorth Korea also threatened to fire at South Korean naval vessels it claims have been violating its territorial waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's presidential Blue House held an emergency national security council meeting to review the threat and discuss possible countermeasures.\n\nIntelligence sources from Seoul and Washington claim that North Korea has been developing a SLBM, which could represent a new threat to South Korea. The sources suggest that North Korea has succeeded in installing a missile launcher onto the submarine after conducting a series of experiments on shore as well as underwater.\n\nThe development of a SLBM would potentially give North Korea a naval strike capability that is at least a decade ahead of South Korea, according to unidentified \"North Korea watchers.\" The South Korean navy has plans to build six 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical missile launchers between 2027 and 2030.\n\nThe development of a SLBM, if confirmed, would significantly escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula and pose a potential threat to South Korea, Japan, and U.S. bases in East Asia. The U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies has previously identified such a capability as a potential new threat to the region.",
    " Title: Biden Addresses Unwanted Touching Allegations, Vows to Change Campaign Style\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, in a speech before the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on Friday, joked about recent allegations of unwanted touching, stating, \"I just want you to know I had permission.\" Later in the speech, Biden interacted with a group of children, shaking their hands and putting his arm around one boy, saying, \"By the way, he gave me permission to touch him.\"\n\nBiden's conduct has been under scrutiny in the past week as several women have claimed they were made uncomfortable by his hugs, shoulder grasps, and other close physical contact. During a question-and-answer session with reporters after the speech, Biden acknowledged, \"I'm not sorry for my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything I've ever done.\" However, he added, \"I think it's going to have to change how I campaign.\"\n\nBiden also addressed the ongoing speculation about his 2020 presidential bid, stating, \"I'm very close to making the decision to stand before you relatively soon.\" He also dismissed the label of being a moderate, contending that the majority of Democratic voters are still liberal-to-moderate Democrats.\n\nPresident Trump, who has been accused by more than a dozen women of inappropriate sexual contact, defended a tweet he posted earlier this week showing a parody video of Biden being approached from behind by a second Biden who rubs his shoulders. When asked whether he was the \"right messenger\" for that, Trump responded, \"I think I am a very good messenger.\" Trump also stated that he does not view Biden as a threat, adding, \"I think he's only a threat to himself.\"\n\nAfter Biden's speech, Trump tweeted that union workers would be voting for him instead. Biden's comments and actions regarding the allegations of unwanted touching come as he prepares for a potential 2020 presidential campaign.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Rebuke: Twelve Republican Senators Join Democrats to Terminate President Trump's National Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare bipartisan move, twelve Republican senators joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to pass a resolution terminating the national emergency declared by President Trump last month. The 59-41 vote was a significant rebuke of the president, who will now issue the first veto of his presidency in order to preserve the emergency declaration.\n\nThe Senate GOP dissenters, including Lamar Alexander, Roy Blunt, Susan Collins, Mike Lee, Jerry Moran, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Rob Portman, Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, and Roger Wicker, represented a cross-section of the Republican party, from conservative to moderate. Most argued that the president was operating outside the rule of law, while some simply called the emergency declaration an executive overreach that Congress had a duty to stop.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, who plans to retire after three terms representing Tennessee rather than seek reelection next year, stated, \"Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway. The problem with this is that after a Revolutionary War against a king, our nation's founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.\"\n\nSenator Collins, the moderate from Maine who is the only senator facing a 2020 reelection campaign among the twelve Republicans to vote for the resolution, argued in a floor speech that Trump's declaration failed to pass the longstanding five-part test of a genuine emergency: \"necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent.\"\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, who took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration during his 2012 presidential campaign, stated, \"This is not a vote against border security. In fact, I agree that a physical barrier is urgently needed to help ease the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and the administration already has $4.5 billion available within existing authority to fund a barrier\u2014even without an emergency declaration.\"\n\nSenator Mike Lee, who thought Trump's declaration was legal under the 1976 National Emergencies Act and was willing to uphold it if the law could be changed to curb the power it gives the executive, ultimately voted against terminating the national emergency when a deal to pass his Article One Act, which would have satisfied his concerns, fell through.\n\nTwo of the more surprising votes against terminating the national emergency were those cast by Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, both of whom face reelection in 2020. Tillis had been expressing disapproval of the emergency declaration for weeks, while Sasse has generally voiced more public criticism of President Trump than any other Republican in the Senate.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse said in a statement, \"The National Emergencies Act (NEA) is 'overly broad and I want to fix it, but at present Nancy Pelosi doesn't, so I am therefore voting against her politically motivated resolution.' As a constitutional conservative, I believe that the NEA currently on the books should be narrowed considerably. That's why I'm an original sponsor of Senator Lee's legislation, and it is why I have repeatedly gone to the White House to seek support for NEA reform.\"\n\nIn contrast, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who voted to uphold the emergency, argued that there is a genuine emergency on the Southern border and that President Trump's declaration was both legal and proper. \"Since last October, Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 260,000 illegal aliens at the border, a surge of 90 percent\u2014almost double\u2014from the previous year,\" he said. \"He [Trump] is only exercising the statutory authority delegated to him by us.\"\n\nWhile the resolution now heads to the House of Representatives, it is expected to pass there as well, setting up a showdown between the two chambers and the president. The outcome of the veto remains uncertain, as the Senate would need a two-thirds majority to override the president's veto.",
    " Title: Sen. Bernie Sanders Defends Record, Highlights Policy Stances Ahead of 2016 Democratic Presidential Nominating Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"New Day,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defended his political record, emphasizing his opposition to free trade agreements and his efforts to regulate Wall Street. Sanders, a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, clarified that his campaign is not directed against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the current frontrunner for the nomination.\n\nSanders stated, \"I have voted against every disastrous trade agreement coming down the pike and [am] helping to lead the effort against this Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will mean the outsourcing of all good-paying jobs to low-wage countries.\" He also mentioned his push for a breakup of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street, arguing that they have too much power.\n\nThe senator further discussed his policy proposals, including free college tuition at public colleges and universities, his leadership on climate change, and his push for legislation that would require the wealthiest individuals and largest corporations to pay their \"fair share\" of taxes.\n\nSanders emphasized, \"Those are my views, and people are going to have to judge Secretary Clinton's views.\" He added, \"I think you have to look at my record. There is, in my lifetime, political life, no special interest that we have not taken on.\"\n\nSanders concluded by stating, \"I think if you look, detail by detail, at my record, I think you find that there's a very strong record [in] standing up for people who are kind of voiceless today, who have given up on the political process, who don't have much power.\"\n\nThe interview underscores Sanders' commitment to addressing income inequality, financial regulation, and climate change, as well as his emphasis on education and tax reform. As the 2016 Democratic presidential nominating contest continues, Sanders' record and policy proposals will be closely scrutinized by voters.",
    " Title: Brussels Attacks: Authorities Search for Suspects as ISIS Claims Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the coordinated attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station in the Belgian capital Tuesday, authorities are searching for suspects and evidence, as ISIS has claimed responsibility for the deadly blasts. At least 30 people were killed and 230 others wounded in the attacks.\n\nOne key piece of evidence authorities are looking at is surveillance footage showing a man wearing light-colored clothes and a hat pushing a baggage cart through the airport. Police have released photos of three men they say are suspects tied to the airport attack, standing side-by-side. The man on the right is the focus of the investigation, as authorities believe he planted a bomb at the airport and left before it exploded.\n\nTwo of the men, wearing black in the surveillance images, are believed to be suicide bombers who died in the explosions in the airport's departure lounge. The man in light-colored clothing is a wanted man, and authorities are asking for the public's help in tracking him down.\n\nA photograph released by investigators shows the three suspects side-by-side. Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said the two men wearing black in the photograph were likely the suicide attackers. Video shows the men exiting a taxi and moving through the airport, according to two U.S. officials. The man dressed in white left the airport after accompanying the other two, a move the officials said appeared to be planned.\n\nA break in the investigation may have come from a taxi driver who took the suspects to the airport. The driver contacted authorities after seeing surveillance footage and gave them the address where he picked the men up, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. That information prompted authorities to raid a residence after the attacks.\n\nInvestigators found a nail bomb, chemical products, and an ISIS flag during a house search in the northeast Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, Belgium's federal prosecutor said in a statement. Hours later, they were still combing through the building for evidence.\n\nSecurity was high, with a helicopter hovering overhead, carrying a sniper with a weapon trained on the building. Masked, armed officers stood guard outside the building, and the burst of camera flashes inside could be seen from the street below. Officers left the building carrying bags of evidence they loaded onto vehicles.\n\nAs doctors treat the wounded and authorities search for suspects, a key question remains unanswered: Could the attacks have anything to do with the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, the Belgium-born French citizen who was hiding out in a Brussels suburb just days before the attacks?\n\nTwo senior U.S. officials told CNN they believe the Belgium attack is tied to the same network as Abdeslam. As authorities continue their investigation, they are determined to defend their freedoms and protect their liberties, as Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said in a resolute message to those who support and cheer the attackers.",
    " Title: ACLU's Commitment to Free Speech: A Continuing Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has once again found itself in the center of a debate over its commitment to the First Amendment, as the organization's national legal director, David Cole, has penned an op-ed piece reassuring readers that the ACLU remains steadfast in its defense of free speech. This renewed discussion on the ACLU's stance on free speech is not a new phenomenon, as concerns about the organization's dedication to the First Amendment have been raised since the 1990s.\n\nIn 1990, \u2588\u2588\u2588 published a cover story in which Charles Oliver argued that the ACLU's commitment to freedom of speech had been compromised by its pursuit of progressive causes. Oliver noted that critics, including longtime ACLU members such as Nat Hentoff and Alan Dershowitz, were complaining that \"greed and left-wing ideology have corrupted the union,\" which had \"diluted its message, compromised its mission, and, in some instances, abandoned its commitment to the First Amendment.\"\n\nFast forward to the present day, and the argument about the ACLU's support for free speech continues, indicating that the organization remains divided on the question. The latest evidence of internal qualms about free speech is a staff memo revealed by Wendy Kaminer, a former member of the ACLU's national board, that suggests the organization's lawyers should consider the impact of speech on \"other values advanced by the ACLU,\" such as equality and racial justice.\n\nThe memo's suggestion that the organization's goals may conflict with each other is troubling, as it invites prioritizing some of those \"other values\" over freedom of speech. The memo implies that freedom of speech conflicts with other rights, which is incoherent, as the whole point of rights is to avoid conflict by delineating each person's legally enforceable claims.\n\nIn response to these concerns, David Cole's op-ed piece reaffirms the ACLU's commitment to defending speech with which it disagrees. Cole's defense of the First Amendment is purely instrumental, as he argues that progressives should support freedom of speech because it helps advance their goals, not because using force to silence offensive speakers is unjust or immoral.\n\nCole's defense of free speech is encouraging, but the need for it is depressing. The ACLU's national legal director has defended high school students disciplined for calling for gun control, students penalized for posting pictures of guns on social media, and anti-Trump as well as pro-Trump demonstrators, among others. Cole's defense of free speech is a reminder of the constitutional bargain that protects the rights of the marginalized and dissidents, who are typically the targets of censorship.\n\nWhile Cole's defense of free speech is a welcome reassurance, it is essential to recognize that the principle of free speech is not without its challenges. The ACLU's commitment to free speech is a testament to the organization's dedication to upholding the Constitution, but it also highlights the ongoing need for vigilance in protecting the First Amendment rights of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or the offensiveness of their speech.",
    " Title: Brexit Vote: Immigration Emerges as a Key Factor in UK's Decision to Leave EU\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent Brexit referendum, immigration has emerged as a significant factor in the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. The UK voted to exit the EU last Thursday, with many citizens expressing their desire to regain control over their nation's immigration policies.\n\nStephen Booth, co-director of Open Europe, a nonpartisan think tank based in London and Brussels, has reported that over three-quarters of the approximately 5 million net immigrants to the United Kingdom between 1990 and 2014 came from outside Europe. Immigrants from the European Union now account for nearly half of the United Kingdom's net inflow, Booth said. The expansion of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, which brought in countries like Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, and the Eurozone economic crisis have contributed to substantial internal immigration to Britain and its relatively strong economy.\n\nProponents of immigration argue that it has grown the British economy, increased tax revenue, and attracted skilled workers. However, critics claim that immigration has placed an enormous strain on the country's welfare state and has changed Britain's culture and values.\n\nIn a letter to the UK-based Guardian, Richard Mountford of Tonbridge, Kent, stated that the Brexit vote was a protest against the mass immigration flow. He suggested that the EU should offer an opt-out from the free movement of people to the UK and any other member state that wants it. This, he argued, would address the main reason for the vote to leave and make it legitimate for the UK government to offer a second referendum, rather than rush to start the exit process.\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Britain voted 52/48 to leave the EU. UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who backed the \"Remain\" camp, announced his resignation the morning after the vote. A new prime minister is projected to be installed sometime in October, with Cameron remaining in a caretaker role.",
    " Title: Sen. Mitt Romney Criticizes President Trump's Behavior in Mueller Report, Trump Responds\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on social media on Friday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) expressed his disapproval of President Donald Trump's behavior as detailed in the recently released report by special counsel Robert Mueller. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee criticized the president's actions and the behavior of individuals in the highest office of the land.\n\nRomney, who was elected to the Senate in 2018, has been a vocal critic of Trump since prior to his presidency. In early 2016, Romney called the future president \"a phony, a fraud\" and a \"failed candidate.\"\n\nThe 488-page report, which summarizes the special counsel's investigation into the 2016 race and related matters, was released on Thursday. The report concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a \"sweeping and systematic fashion\" and identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. However, investigators did not find evidence of Trump's associates illegally coordinating with Moscow, and Mueller did not make a determination with respect to the obstruction question.\n\n\"It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on,\" Romney wrote.\n\n\"Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia \u2014 including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine,\" Romney continued.\n\nPresident Trump responded on Twitter on Saturday by sharing a video that mocked Romney's loss during the 2012 election to former President Barack Obama. \"If @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe),\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe special counsel's probe was started by James Comey, who was fired by Trump early on in the probe, and the investigation was subsequently expanded under Mueller to determine whether the president's conduct constituted obstruction of justice. The report's release marked the end of the investigation, and Trump has celebrated the report, declaring on Twitter that \"The Russia Hoax is dead!\"",
    " Title: Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile Accuses Clinton Campaign of Being \"Cult-Like,\" Sparks Controversy Among Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of revelations from her new book and subsequent media interviews, former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Donna Brazile has portrayed the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as an impenetrable, even \"cult-like\" environment that stifled any dissenting voices and advisers who warned about the missteps that ultimately paved the way for Donald Trump's victory.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Wednesday, Brazile seemed to soften her criticism of the Clinton team regarding sexism, but described their attitude as \"dismissive\" and \"condescending.\" Brazile also suggested that the campaign placed too much emphasis on data and analytics, neglecting traditional, grassroots campaigning.\n\n\"Everybody worshipped the data and the analytics,\" Brazile wrote in her book, \"Hacks.\" She told Fox News that she and campaign manager Robby Mook came from \"different\" schools, with the Clinton team favoring algorithms and data modeling.\n\nWhen asked why she didn't manage to effect change within the campaign, Brazile told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Wednesday that she \"could not crack them.\" She described the campaign as a \"cult\" that was difficult to penetrate.\n\nThe book and Brazile's subsequent media appearances have sparked tension within the Democratic Party, with dozens of Clinton campaign team members firing back over the weekend in an open letter. The letter stated, \"We do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.\"\n\nOne of the most explosive claims in Brazile's book is that the DNC struck a deal with the Clinton campaign, giving the campaign partial control over party decisions and resources in exchange for financial assistance. This claim has fueled longstanding concerns among supporters of Bernie Sanders, who felt that Sanders was at a disadvantage in the primary race against Clinton due to the perceived favoritism.\n\nBrazile maintains that she worked hard during the general election to help Clinton win and emphasizes that her aim is to help the party heal. \"I'm focusing on making sure that grassroots Democrats know that our party is going to become stronger,\" she told Fox News. \"We had a very competitive primary. I don't know when the Republicans will sit down and heal their wounds, but we are healing our wounds, and we are going to learn how to become a stronger, more effective party.\"",
    " Title: East Coast Storm Causes Travel Disruptions and Casualties Ahead of Thanksgiving\n\nArticle:\n\nA massive winter storm that originated on the West Coast has been causing travel disruptions and casualties across the country, particularly on the East Coast, as thousands prepare to travel for Thanksgiving. The storm has led to more than 100 wrecks and has been blamed for at least seven deaths.\n\nThe storm started on the West Coast, with a 52-year-old man in Yuba County, California, dying when a tree fell on top of his vehicle on Thursday. Road conditions were also blamed for the deaths of two people in New Mexico, three people in an icy pileup along Interstate 40 in northwest Texas, and four deaths in Oklahoma since late last week.\n\nThe storm has been particularly harsh on the East Coast, with snow, rain, and ice affecting many areas. One stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh, saw a mix of snow, rain, and ice over the course of Tuesday. Snow was also the issue for cities and towns along the Appalachian Mountains, all the way down to West Virginia. Parts of upstate New York, including Buffalo and Syracuse, were seeing flakes on Tuesday night.\n\nTemperatures are expected to rise into the 50s during the night in Philadelphia and Boston, but the wind speed is expected to be the story in these areas. Sustained winds in New York will reach 19 to 24 mph, with gusts blowing as strong as 55 mph. The wind could also hamper the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade through the streets of Manhattan, as the giant balloons that are the parade's trademarks may not soar if sustained winds exceed 23 mph that day.\n\nThe storm is also expected to cause significant delays and cancellations at airports, particularly in the Northeast. As of Tuesday night, the weather's effect on flights was fairly minimal, with 158 flights canceled nationwide and another 84 scuttled Wednesday, according to the air travel tracking website Flightaware.com. However, there is a possibility that the situation could turn for the worse, leading to major delays or more cancellations.\n\nMajor airlines like Delta, US Airways, JetBlue, and United have already relaxed their policies by letting some customers change their reservations without a fee. Still, the vast majority of travelers, 43.4 million by AAA's count, will not be in the air but on the road. For them, the combination of strong winds and slick surfaces, even if they are not coated with snow or ice, could lead to problems.\n\nIn expectation of such headaches, CNN encourages travelers to make a plan, pack snacks and patience in case of delays, and drive safely.",
    " Title: \"Paul Ryan's Journey: From Fiscal Hawk to Political Maverick\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview, former Representative Paul Ryan, now a familiar name in national politics, recounted his journey from a fervent advocate for fiscal responsibility to a politician who found himself at the center of controversial bailout votes during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDuring a lunch meeting at ABC before his rise to prominence, Ryan, then a lesser-known congressman, impressed the interviewer with his concern for America's looming debt crisis and his interest in F.A. Hayek's \"The Road to Serfdom.\" However, his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the auto industry bailout left many questioning his commitment to free-market principles.\n\nRyan defended his decisions, stating that he voted for TARP to prevent a deflationary spiral and the collapse of the economy. He explained that his support for the auto bailout was to prevent the companies from receiving TARP funds. He acknowledged that TARP had become a \"revolving government slush fund,\" but it was never intended to be so.\n\nThe interview delved into the debate over government intervention in the economy, with the interviewer questioning whether government should have bailed out the auto industry. Ryan expressed regret over his votes but emphasized the political climate at the time, with the political class in near panic.\n\nRyan's 2008 \"Roadmap for the Future,\" a budget plan aimed at slowing the growth of government, was criticized as too radical, even by fellow Republicans. However, Ryan believes his plan helped shift the political discourse, leading to a more conservative approach to entitlement programs and a renewed focus on limited government and economic freedom.\n\nRyan's evolving political stance and his role in the debate over government intervention and entitlement programs highlight the complexities of politics and the challenges of balancing economic principles with practical political considerations. As the interview concludes, Ryan reflects on the importance of reviving the American idea and moving away from a welfare state towards a society that values economic freedom and limited government.",

According to two unnamed diplomats, as reported by The Associated Press, the deal, which would limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, is expected to be announced on Monday.\n\nNPR's Peter Kenyon, reporting from Vienna, shares that Iranian TV is fueling anticipation for a deal. He reported that Iranian media is predicting an agreement will occur, and Iranian officials are describing the document as running nearly 100 pages, including several technical annexes.\n\nHowever, most reports of an imminent deal include the caveat that a few issues need to be resolved, and various capitals must sign off on any agreement. If an accord is reached, exhausted negotiators will have little time to celebrate their achievement, as critics in Congress have already begun to voice their opposition, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reiterated his argument that Iran poses a greater threat than the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nThe BBC provides a summary of statements made by high-level officials regarding the negotiations on Sunday:\n\n- US Secretary of State John Kerry stated, \"A few tough things need to be resolved, but we're getting to some real decisions.\"\n- French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who cancelled a trip to Africa to stay at the talks, said, \"I hope we are finally entering the final phase of these marathon negotiations. I believe it.\"\n- In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said the sides had \"come a long way.\" He added, \"We need to reach a peak and we're very close.\"\n\nIf the deal is indeed reached, it would signify the culmination of decades of diplomatic efforts. However, the deal would need to be approved by several capitals, including the U.S. Congress.",

A spokeswoman for the IG's office stated that 26 facilities are currently being investigated nationwide.\n\nLast week, Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin testified before a Senate committee that at least 10 new allegations about manipulated waiting times and other problems have surfaced since reports of issues at the Phoenix VA hospital emerged last month. The expanded investigations come as President Barack Obama's choice to help carry out reforms at the VA, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors, is set to meet with staff at the Phoenix VA office.\n\nNabors met with representatives of several veterans' organizations, including the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans, on Tuesday. He will meet with leadership at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Thursday, including interim director Steve Young, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. Young took over in Phoenix after director Sharon Helman was placed on indefinite leave while the VA's Office of Inspector General investigates claims raised by several former VA employees that Phoenix administrators kept a secret list of patients waiting for appointments to hide delays in care.\n\nCritics say Helman was motivated to conceal delays to collect a bonus of about $9,000 last year. A former clinic director for the VA in Phoenix first came out publicly with the allegations of secret lists in April. Dr. Samuel Foote, who retired in December after nearly 25 years with the VA, says that up to 40 veterans may have died while awaiting treatment at the Phoenix hospital. Investigators have not yet linked any patient deaths in Phoenix to delayed care.\n\nThe allegations have sparked a firestorm on Capitol Hill and some calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation. The VA's undersecretary for health care, Robert Petzel, has since stepped down. However, Republicans denounced the move as a hollow gesture, since Petzel had already been scheduled to retire soon. Several lawmakers are proposing legislation to address VA problems.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, told The Associated Press on Tuesday he plans to introduce legislation this week to ensure that internal probes by the VA's Office of Medical Inspector are released to Congress and the public \"so the full scope of the VA's dysfunction can not be disguised.\" Moran noted that a VA nurse in Cheyenne, Wyoming, was put on leave this month for allegedly telling employees to falsify appointment records. The action came after an email about possible wait-list manipulation at the Cheyenne hospital was leaked to the media.\n\nHowever, Moran said the Cheyenne center was already the subject of a December 2013 report by Office of the Medical Inspector. That report apparently substantiated claims of improper scheduling practices, but it's unclear if action taken at the Cheyenne center was based on the medical inspector's findings, Moran said. \"Because OMI reports are not available to the public and have not been previously released to Congress, it is impossible to know whether the VA has taken action to implement the OMI's recommendations for improvement in each case,\" Moran said.\n\nMeanwhile, two Republican senators introduced legislation to prohibit payment of bonuses to employees at the Veterans Health Administration through next year. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Deb Fischer of Nebraska said the VA should focus its spending on fixing problems at the agency, \"not rewarding employees entrenched in a failing bureaucracy.\" Burr is the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and Fischer is a panel member.\n\nThe House passed a bill in February eliminating performance bonuses for the department's senior executive staff through 2018. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, also called on Obama to back off plans to nominate Jeffrey Murawsky to replace Petzel at the VA. Murawsky, a career VA administrator, directly supervised Helman from 2010 to 2012. The White House has said Obama remains confident in Shinseki's leadership and is standing behind Murawsky's nomination. Shinseki and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met with the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday to discuss how the two departments can improve interactions between their health records systems. The two Cabinet members said in a joint statement that the meeting was productive and that both men share the same goal \u2014 to improve health outcomes of active duty military, veterans, and beneficiaries.",
    " Title: Poll Workers Brace for Potential Election Day Violence as Tensions Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation gears up for the upcoming elections, poll workers across the country are on high alert, preparing for potential violence at polling stations. This heightened sense of vigilance follows recent incidents such as the firebombing of a Republican Party headquarters in North Carolina and reports of armed individuals loitering outside a Democratic campaign office in Virginia.\n\nLouisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler, in a hearing last month regarding potential hacking of voting machines, expressed concern not about cyber threats, but about the possibility of violence at the polls. Amber McReynolds, the director of elections for the city and county of Denver, shares this sentiment.\n\nMcReynolds has incorporated active shooter training into the election judge training in Denver, emphasizing the need for poll workers to handle any situation in a calm and responsive manner. They also have a central hotline for reporting problems, allowing her office to track issues throughout the city on Election Day.\n\nMatt Masterson, a member of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that collaborates with state and local election offices, confirms that almost every jurisdiction has a detailed plan for voting place emergencies. These plans were strengthened after the September 11 terrorist attacks, which occurred on a primary election day in New York City.\n\nMasterson believes that, given the current election climate, these plans are receiving extra attention. He notes that election officials have revisited and updated their plans, ensuring that poll workers are well-versed in handling any escalation of conversations in polling places.\n\nTo avoid Election Day confrontations, Masterson suggests that everyone\u2014including poll workers, candidates, and outside monitors\u2014understands the rules in advance. For instance, are voters allowed to carry guns into polling stations? While it's prohibited in many places, it's allowed in some open-carry states.\n\nSchedler, in a recent statement, acknowledged the difficulty election officials face in maintaining a balance between ensuring voter safety and creating a welcoming environment. He expressed concern about the sight of individuals, armed and standing at polling stations, stating that such a sight is not typically what voters should experience.\n\nMasterson and McReynolds agree that most confrontations can be managed by polite but firm poll workers. They emphasize the importance of clear communication, advanced knowledge of rules, and a well-prepared workforce to ensure a safe and peaceful Election Day.",
    " Title: Congressional Divide on Marijuana Legalization: A New Frontier in Intraparty Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, members of the U.S. Congress are publicly debating the issue of marijuana legalization, with some calling for stricter enforcement of federal laws and others advocating for a more lenient approach.\n\nDuring a recent appropriations hearing with DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, Representatives Andrew Harris (R-MD), Frank Wolf (R-Va.), and Jo Bonner (R-Ala.) urged the Obama administration to intervene in Colorado and Washington, states that have legalized marijuana. Their call marks the first time members of Congress have openly advocated for federal intervention in states that have legalized marijuana.\n\nHowever, this call for stricter enforcement contrasts with a bill being prepared by Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), which aims to protect marijuana users and business owners from federal prosecution, as long as they are in compliance with state laws. The bill, known as the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act, would amend the Controlled Substances Act, which makes the sale and use of marijuana illegal under federal law.\n\nRohrabacher, who is reportedly about to introduce the bill, called it \"common sense\" and said it \"keeps the federal government out of the business of criminalizing marijuana activities.\" The bill has five co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, including Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Don Young (R-Alaska), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), and Jared Polis (D-Col.).\n\nThe debate between these two opposing views has the potential to create a minor schism within the Republican caucus. While some members are pushing for stricter enforcement, others are preparing to introduce bills that would effectively stop the DEA from intervening in states that have legalized marijuana.\n\nTwo recent polls shed light on the public's stance on this issue. A December poll by Gallup found that there is no partisan split when it comes to enforcing federal drug laws against pro-pot states. This suggests that the GOP's federalists may have the upper hand in Congress, as being anti-pot but pro-states' rights could appeal to both older voters the party needs to hold and younger voters the party needs to win.\n\nHowever, if this becomes another cause for social conservatives who are already irritated by the GOP's softening on gay marriage, the pro-pot faction may face opposition. The intraparty debate on marijuana legalization could potentially become a significant issue in the next three years, challenging the traditional views of the Republican Party.",
    " Title: Trump Leads Clinton in Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio in Latest Statewide Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588, Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton in the battleground states of Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio. The polls, released Wednesday, show Trump with a three-point advantage over Clinton in Nevada (43-40 percent), a five-point lead in North Carolina (45-40 percent), and a five-point lead in Ohio (42-37 percent).\n\nIn Nevada, Trump's lead is due to strong support from working-class white voters, while Clinton is struggling with younger voters and women. The poll shows that those under 45 are almost equally likely to back Clinton (42 percent) as they are to back Trump (39 percent), with Johnson receiving double-digit support (11 percent). Women in Nevada backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 16-point margin in 2012, but Clinton is only up by six points in the current poll.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump is leading by five points among likely voters, with whites backing Trump by a 31-point margin (58-27 percent), while blacks support Clinton by 82 points (85-3 percent). The poll also shows that voters under 45 prefer Clinton by 46-32, but Johnson gets 11 percent of their support.\n\nIn Ohio, Trump is also leading by five points among likely voters, with a significant edge among independents (42 percent) and working-class whites (51 percent). Clinton is only up by three points among women, who supported Obama by 11 points in 2012.\n\nThe polls also ask about the senate races in these key states. In Nevada, Joe Heck leads his Democratic opponent Catherine Cortez Masto by seven points, while in North Carolina, incumbent Sen. Richard Burr bests Democratic challenger Deborah Ross by 43-37 percent. In Ohio, Rob Portman holds a 14-point lead over Democrat Ted Strickland.\n\nThe polls were conducted September 18-20, 2016, by telephone with live interviewers among a sample of likely voters selected from statewide voter files in Nevada (704), North Carolina (734), and Ohio (737). The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the total sample of likely voters in each state.",
    " Title: Biden Secures Victory in Illinois Primary, Strengthening Democratic Nomination Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the Democratic presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden has emerged victorious in the Illinois primary, securing 59.5% of the votes over Senator Bernie Sanders' 35.8%, according to reports with 96% of precincts reporting.\n\nThe election day in Illinois was marked by unprecedented circumstances, with delayed results, missing election judges, dwindling supplies of hand sanitizer, and debates over whether the state should hold its primary during the global health pandemic.\n\nSpeaking from his Delaware home, Biden described the night as \"very good\" in Illinois and Florida, stating that he was \"a little closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president.\" He also addressed Sanders' supporters, saying, \"I hear you. I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do.\"\n\nBiden performed particularly well with women voters, older voters, and African-American voters, according to CNN polls. He garnered 70% of the African-American vote, compared to Sanders' 27%. Among women, Biden had 65% to Sanders' 30%. Sanders, unsurprisingly, performed well with voters aged 17-44, securing 63% of the vote, compared to Biden's 17%.\n\nThe race was closer in Chicago, with Biden at 50.43% and Sanders at 45.52% with 77% of precincts reporting. In suburban Cook County, with 95% of precincts reporting, Biden led Sanders 62.76% to 32.81%.\n\nHistorically low Election Day turnout in Chicago prompted Biden to rely on a record number of early voters and those who voted by mail. The states of Illinois, Florida, and Arizona, with their combined 441 delegates, held their primaries on Tuesday despite the coronavirus outbreak. Biden won all three states, with Illinois offering 155 pledged delegates.\n\nThe Democratic presidential race now consists of Biden, Sanders, and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, but Illinois voters had 13 candidates to choose from in the mail-in, early voting, and Election Day ballots. Most candidates dropped out of the race in early March, as Biden and Sanders continued to gain delegates across the nation.\n\nThe tide turned when Biden won nine states on March 3, the most important voting day in the Democratic party, and Democratic moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar quickly dropped out. With Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg also out, all eyes were on the former vice president and the democratic socialist, each representing competing factions of the Democratic party.\n\nSanders lost Illinois in 2016 by a tiny margin of just 2 percentage points to Hillary Clinton. He was boosted by a Chicago rally on the eve of the election, attracting many young, progressive voters.\n\nDue to the coronavirus, both the Biden and Sanders campaigns had to cancel events in the waning days of the election. This meant no last-minute in-person rallies and no door-to-door campaigning, with most voter contact over the weekend being via apps, calls, texts, and emails.\n\nSanders, on Tuesday evening, addressed the need to ensure that any coronavirus medical care be affordable for low-income families in a virtual event. Biden, on Friday, hosted his own live-streamed event instead of planned fundraisers and a public rally. Sanders came out to Chicago on March 7 to host a rally, just before the coronavirus spread led to closures across the state.\n\nSanders was backed by two top leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union and Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, D-Ill., the most prominent Illinois elected official supporting him. Biden, on the other hand, secured crucial endorsements from Mayor Lori Lightfoot and three African American members of Congress from Illinois\u2014Representatives Bobby Rush, Danny Davis, and Robin Kelly, whose districts have the highest concentration of black voters in the state.\n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a major Hillary Clinton backer in 2016, also endorsed Biden for president on Monday, despite his earlier vow to stay out of the primary. The billionaire entrepreneur and businessman turned governor had repeatedly vowed to stay out of the primary but eventually endorsed Biden to ensure Illinois voters still went out to the polls.",
    " Title: \"The Urgent Call for a National Emergency Declaration: Addressing the Opioid Crisis and Securing the U.S.-Mexico Border\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the opioid crisis has become a national health emergency, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting 70,237 drug overdose deaths in 2017, a number that remained high in 2018. This alarming statistic, coupled with the fact that the majority of these opioids originate from Mexico, has led to calls for a national emergency declaration under the National Emergency Act.\n\nThe opioid crisis, with its devastating toll on American lives, has been a significant concern for several years. In 2017, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency, but the situation has not improved, with over 70,000 Americans still dying annually from drug overdoses. This is a crisis of unprecedented proportions, and it is time for the U.S. government to treat it as such.\n\nBorder patrol agents in Arizona recently confiscated the largest seizure in U.S. history of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid blamed for the majority of overdose deaths. The overwhelming majority of this deadly substance comes from Mexico. The porous southern border allows drug traffickers to easily and regularly cross, delivering death to Americans.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency would allow for the allocation of additional resources to combat this crisis at its source. The current 32 national emergencies declared by the U.S. government, none of which have resulted in American deaths, pale in comparison to the yearly carnage of our people due to illegal drugs from Mexico.\n\nThe benefits of declaring a national emergency are clear. First, the opioid crisis is, indeed, a catastrophe of unprecedented levels. Second, in addition to the opioid deaths, the problem of gang members and criminals crossing the border and causing mayhem in our nation is a significant concern. Every death and injury inflicted upon an American citizen by an illegal alien is a preventable crime if we had an effective border barrier.\n\nCongressman Gosar, a representative from a border district in Arizona, has been a long-time advocate for secure borders. He, along with many other Americans, questions why the D.C. swamp is against a national emergency declaration to protect American citizens in their own country, but cheers when a national emergency is used for international issues with no impact on U.S. citizens. The President should do what is right and declare an emergency\u2014because it is.",
    " Title: Election Results: Houston Rejects Transgender \"Bathroom Bill,\" Ohio Marijuana Legalization Fails, and Gubernatorial Races Decided\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of election races across the country on Tuesday, Houston voters rejected a proposed transgender \"bathroom bill,\" Ohioans rejected a marijuana legalization measure, and Republicans captured both gubernatorial contests at stake.\n\nIn Houston, with 30 percent of precincts counted, The Associated Press declared that Houston's Proposition 1 had gone down to defeat. The measure was taking a beating with 62 percent of voters against the measure and 38 percent in favor. The vote capped an 18-month battle between Houston pastors and Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city, who had championed the ordinance allowing people to use restrooms, showers, and other public accommodations based on their gender identity, not their biological sex.\n\nIn Kentucky, Republican businessman Matt Bevin defeated Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway by 53 to 44 percent, with independent Drew Curtis taking 4 percent in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear. Meanwhile, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant easily won a second term over Robert Gray, a Democrat who spent just $3,000 in a token campaign in the overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nOhio voters overwhelmingly rejected Issue 3, which would have legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 and over, handing the pro-pot movement its first defeat since Colorado and Washington approved legalization measures in 2012. In Ohio, however, there was a twist: the proposal would have also created a monopoly on cultivation for 10 investors, prompting opponents to denounce the measure as an example of \"weed greed.\"\n\n\"When it comes to the broader debate about legalizing marijuana, the defeat of Issue 3 won't be a case of 'as Ohio goes, so goes the nation,'\" said Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, in a statement. Unlike Ohio, the four states\u2014Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska\u2014that have approved recreational pot for adults began with medical marijuana.\n\n\"This was about a flawed measure and a campaign that didn't represent what voters want,\" Mr. Angell said.\n\nMr. Bevin, a Kentucky business owner who had challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP primary, ran as a political outsider with strong tea party support. He won the GOP gubernatorial primary in a crowded Republican field by just 83 votes. In his victory speech, Mr. Bevin issued a clarion call for unity, praising Mr. Conway and saying \"this is our opportunity to come together as one. We have much work ahead of us.\"\n\nHis running mate\u2014Lt. Gov.-elect Jenean Hampton, who introduced him Tuesday night\u2014became the first black person to win a statewide race in Kentucky. Mr. Conway made a concession and congratulations call before 9 p.m., telling supporters at the Frankfort Convention Center that he had told his rival that he \"remained positive about moving this state forward, and that if he ever needed any assistance, that this Democrat was at his disposal.\"\n\nThe result came as a bit of an upset because every poll had shown Mr. Conway ahead of Mr. Bevin, albeit only slightly in recent weeks. His election nearly completes Kentucky's shift from Democratic to Republican over the past few decades as GOP candidates gain ground in statewide races.\n\nRunning as a conservative Christian, Mr. Bevin was known for his unswerving support of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who drew national attention over her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. By contrast, Mr. Conway, when he was attorney general and a year before the Supreme Court's ruling, decided not to appeal a federal judge's order that the state marry same-sex couples, effectively imposing gay marriage on the state by default.\n\nThe Bevin campaign hammered Mr. Conway over his support for President Obama, with ads saying that the Democratic candidate was in favor of Obamacare, gun control, and abortion but against coal, \"just like Obama.\" The American Principles Project declared in a news release that social issues and candidates who support traditional values had won big.\n\n\"Bevin's upset victory in Kentucky is a victory for Kim Davis, a rebuke to those who say social issues hurt the GOP, and a call for Republicans nationally to support the First Amendment Defense Act,\" said the American Principles Project's Maggie Gallagher in a statement.\n\nMississippi Attorney General Jim Hood was also leading in his bid for a fourth term. The Democrat's race was especially significant in that he is believed to be the only Democrat still holding statewide elected office in the Deep South. Whatever happens in Mississippi, Louisiana could change that later this month. That state already had its so-called \"jungle primary\" for governor last month, narrowing the field to the top two vote-getters, Democratic candidate John Bel Edwards and Republican David Vitter. They now square off on Nov. 21.\n\nMore than 300 cities held mayoral elections, the biggest being Houston and Philadelphia, America's fourth- and fifth-largest cities. In Houston, seven candidates face off in a nonpartisan race to succeed Mayor Annise Parker, who pushed the transgender ordinance but is term-limited herself. In overwhelmingly Democratic Philadelphia, former city council member Jim Kenney easily defeated a Republican businessman to succeed term-limited Mayor Michael Nutter.",
    " Title: Clinton Email Scandal Deepens as Classified Information from Spy Satellites and Signal Intelligence Found\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, it has been revealed that Hillary Rodham Clinton's private emails contained sensitive information derived from spy satellites and signal intelligence, a revelation that undermines her defense that she had no reason to believe she was dealing with classified information, security experts say.\n\nThe latest findings have prompted questions about Clinton's competence and knowledge of handling government secrets. Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst trained in the rules of handling government secrets, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that if Clinton is so ignorant that she doesn't recognize that this type of information in the email as being classified, it calls into question her overall competence.\n\nAs details emerge about the extent of Clinton's use of personal email to exclusively conduct business as secretary of state, her defense has shifted. At first, she stated flatly that her private emails did not hold or transmit classified information. She later amended that defense to claim that none of the information she sent by private email was classified at the time she sent it. Now, her defenders have evolved her story further, suggesting that she didn't know information she was handling was classified because it wasn't marked as such.\n\nPete Hoekstra, former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote an op-ed published Wednesday in The New York Post calling the latest explanation from the Clinton camp a \"sham.\" Hoekstra and former federal prosecutor Victoria Toensing wrote in the joint op-ed that repeating in an email classified information from a report or a secure briefing still violates regulations.\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Mr. Hoekstra said that even if the information was not marked as classified, it still violates regulations to repeat it in an email. He recalled the extraordinary steps the intelligence community took when it gave him top-secret information. He received the data either in a secure room in a House office, at an off-site FBI facility, or on his secure phone.\n\nAsked whether it was possible that Clinton dealt with top-secret material but did not know it, Mr. Hoekstra answered: \"Sure, it's always possible that you will have received information from the intelligence community that they consider top secret and you may not be aware of that. Unlikely, but possible.\"\n\nLast month, the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence community flatly contradicted Clinton's claim that her emails did not contain national secrets. They wrote in a public joint statement that the information among thousands of emails on her private server was definitely classified at the time.\n\nThis week, I. Charles McCullough III, the intelligence community's inspector general, revealed that not only did a small sampling of Clinton's 30,000 emails turned over to State contain classified information, but two held data that were top-secret \u2014 the highest classification.\n\nMr. McCullough went further. The top-secret information was labeled \"SI,\" which is intelligence community parlance for \"special intelligence.\" Special intelligence is intercepted communications from foreign targets. In addition, the intercept came from code word \"talent keyhole,\" (TK), which stands for the nation's military satellites and their production of classified imagery and intercepted communications.\n\nAn intelligence spokeswoman said the TK compartmental function \"protects information and activities related to space-based collection of imagery, signals, measurement and signature intelligence, certain products, processing and exploitation techniques, and the design, acquisition, and operation of reconnaissance satellites.\"\n\n\"TOP SECRET/SI/TK\" means her server held some of the nation's most sensitive information. The information could have come from the National Security Agency and most certainly the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, experts said.\n\nLarry Johnson, the former CIA analyst, said revelations about the highly sensitive nature of information in certain emails call into question the entirety of Clinton's story about the private email server she operated out of her home in Chappaqua, New York.\n\n\"She's admitting she lacks the knowledge and intelligence to recognize classified information. That's her defense? That she's stupid?\" he said. \"I think she knew it was classified and used it. They were passing information back and forth.\"\n\nThe SI and TK designations mean that if Clinton's server was hacked, \"there is the possibility of compromising multiple intelligence sources,\" Mr. Johnson said. Because Clinton conducted all State Department business on one server at her home, it is assumed that her aides also passed classified information on unsecure systems. This is because a commercial system such as Clinton's can not communicate with a secure government network set up to handle and protect secrets. Clinton did not use a State.gov account, as is expected of all State Department employees.\n\nIntelligence experts said Clinton's server, which she turned over under pressure to the Justice Department this week after having vowed never to part with it, was susceptible to hacks from adversaries such as China and Russia.\n\nClinton handed over 30,000 printed emails in December after the special House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, pressed the State Department for her emails and discovered they were all on her own server. Watchdog groups, including Judicial Watch, have filed lawsuits to obtain the emails under the Freedom of Information Act. Prodded by a federal judge, State Department foreign service officers and, more recently, outside intelligence officials, have been sifting through the material to delete government secrets. The inspectors general estimate that hundreds of emails will be shown to contain classified information before the tedious process is complete.",
    " Title: South Dakota's Concealed Carry Law: New Governor's Support Offers Fresh Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the incoming Republican Governor, Kristi Noem, set to take office in January, supporters of legislation allowing permitless concealed carry in South Dakota are optimistic about the bill's prospects. The legislation, which has previously been vetoed by outgoing Governor Dennis Daugaard, has been a contentious issue in the state.\n\nState Sen.-elect Lynne DiSanto, who sponsored a permitless concealed carry bill that Daugaard vetoed in 2017, expressed optimism about the bill's chances in the upcoming session. \"There are a lot of Republicans that are very excited to have a conservative governor,\" said DiSanto. \"I think under a new governor, it's very likely to pass.\"\n\nCurrently, it is a misdemeanor for someone to carry a concealed pistol or have one concealed in a vehicle without a permit. As of the end of October, there were nearly 108,000 pistol permits in South Dakota, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nDaugaard has previously stated that the state's gun laws are reasonable, but bill supporters argue that getting a concealed pistol permit can be burdensome. Daugaard vetoed DiSanto's proposal in 2017 and also rejected a similar measure in 2012. Constitutional carry legislation failed during the 2018 session after Daugaard issued a veto threat.\n\nNoem, who defeated Democratic state Sen. Billie Sutton in the Nov. 6 election, has previously expressed support for permitless carry. In January, she urged passage of a permitless carry bill, though she did not endorse a specific plan at the time. Transition team spokeswoman Kristin Wileman said this week that Noem would not commit to legislation until she can review its text, but she is a strong 2nd Amendment supporter and believes provisions like constitutional carry can \"protect and even strengthen this right for South Dakotans.\"\n\nStaci Ackerman, executive director of the South Dakota Sheriffs' Association, said the group has not discussed 2019 legislation yet. However, the organization supported a bill in the 2018 session that allowed permitless carry for state residents with a South Dakota driver's license or identification card; the measure did not advance out of the Senate.\n\nThe 2019 session is scheduled to run from January 8 to March 29. With Republicans controlling both houses of the Legislature as well as the governorship, it remains to be seen whether the permitless concealed carry bill will be passed in the upcoming session.",
    " Title: Pelosi Secures Re-Election as House Democratic Leader, Fends Off Challenge from Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested election, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has successfully retained her position, defeating Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. Pelosi received 134 votes, while Ryan garnered 63.\n\nPelosi, who has been a prominent figure in House Democratic leadership since 2003, secured over two-thirds of the caucus's support, as she had predicted. This victory marks her sixth year as House Democratic leader, and her first as minority leader following the Republicans' retention of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nPelosi, aged 76, made history in 2006 when she became the first female speaker of the House, a position she held until 2011. However, since the Democrats' significant losses in 2010, Pelosi has faced questions about her leadership in the minority party.\n\nIn 2010, she faced a challenge from then-North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, who received 43 votes. Ryan's 63 votes represent the most significant opposition Pelosi has faced in her leadership bids.\n\nThe debate over Pelosi's leadership reflects a broader discussion within the Democratic Party regarding its direction following Hillary Clinton's surprising and disappointing loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race. House Democrats had hoped to gain as many as 15 or 20 seats, but ultimately flipped only six, a result that left many Democrats dissatisfied.\n\nTrump's victory was achieved through narrow margins in several Rust Belt states, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which delivered him the Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency. Many of the seats Democrats were unable to win back were located in more working-class, rural areas of these states. Ryan argued that the party needed someone who understands blue-collar voters and fresh, younger leadership. As a 43-year-old Democrat from Youngstown, Ohio, Ryan believed he was better positioned to appeal to these voters.\n\nRyan's home county flipped to Trump by six points after previously voting for President Obama by 22 points in 2012. Pelosi, in an interview with the Huffington Post, dismissed this loss, stating that Ryan \"didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\" However, others saw Ryan's performance in his district as a sign that he could connect with working-class voters more effectively than someone from a liberal stronghold like San Francisco.",
    " Title: Analysis: The Controversy Surrounding Attorney General William Barr and the Calls for His Resignation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Attorney General William Barr has found himself at the center of a heated debate, with the left expressing concern and calling for his resignation. This controversy, however, may not be as dire as some media outlets and center-left figures suggest.\n\nThe controversy stems from Barr's decision to change the sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, a longtime associate of President Donald Trump. This decision has led to a letter signed by over 2,000 former Justice Department employees calling for Barr to step down, and articles in publications like The Atlantic labeling Barr as \"un-American.\"\n\nHowever, the alleged offense that Barr is being accused of does not seem to match the severity of actions taken by some of his predecessors. For instance, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer carried out raids to arrest suspected leftists in the wake of World War I, and Attorney General Robert Kennedy authorized the wiretapping of Martin Luther King.\n\nThe Stone case, in comparison, saw Barr changing the sentencing recommendation from an initial call for seven to nine years to a recommendation of a prison term that has yet to be determined. The suspicion is that Barr was acting on Trump's behalf, but Barr maintains that he was surprised by the initial sentencing recommendation and intended to amend it before Trump's public comments about the matter.\n\nIf Barr were truly acting as Trump's \"henchman,\" as some suggest, he would have quashed the Stone case rather than merely recommending a reduced sentence. Barr, in fact, has stated that he considers the Stone case a \"righteous\" prosecution.\n\nFurthermore, Barr allowed the Mueller probe to reach its conclusion without interference, and the extent of his alleged interference was summarizing the findings in a way that was not as harsh or detailed as some Trump critics desired. He also declined to prosecute former Department of Justice official Andrew McCabe for lying to investigators, a move that would have been a priority if Barr were truly Trump's personal enforcer.\n\nThe allegations against Barr are not without their critics, who argue that Barr is undermining the rule of law and norms. However, it is worth considering that a norm-busting violation of the rules, such as the abusive FISA surveillance of former Trump campaign official Carter Page, has already occurred.\n\nThe supposed institutionalists and civil libertarians who are piling on Barr are more outraged that he wants to investigate this abuse and related 2016 investigatory overreach than by the abuse itself. It is no wonder that Barr has a contempt for his critics, many of whom are so inflamed by their opposition to Trump that they have lost any sense of standards.\n\nIn a speech at a Federalist Society conference last year, Barr rightly warned that \"it is the Left that is engaged in a systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, it seems that Barr is doing his best to render fair justice in a challenging political environment created by a president who frequently comments on pending criminal cases and investigations, and by the Justice Department's own politically fraught and overzealous intervention in the 2016 election and its aftermath. Whether or not one agrees with Barr's actions, it is clear that he is a serious legal figure and one of the adults in the room late in President Trump's first term.",
    " Title: Obama's Proposal for Higher Minimum Wage Sparks Debate in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising shift, President Obama has called for a significant increase in the federal minimum wage during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. The proposal, which aims to boost the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour by 2015, has sparked a heated debate in Congress, with supporters and opponents voicing their views on the issue.\n\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 per hour. The proposed wage increase would be implemented in stages, with the minimum wage reaching $9 in two years, after which it would be indexed to inflation. The White House estimates that 15 million workers would directly benefit from the higher minimum wage, with many more gaining indirectly due to the ripple effect as the wage scale adjusts.\n\nPresident Obama argued that the current minimum wage is not sufficient to lift a full-time worker above the poverty line. \"We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages,\" Obama said. \"But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.\"\n\nThe president's focus on the minimum wage came as a surprise, even to longtime supporters of a pay increase. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in an interview that while she agrees with the president, \"I didn't know he would bring it up.\"\n\nOpponents, such as House Speaker John Boehner (R), have already expressed their opposition to the proposal. Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would make it harder for small employers to hire people. \"When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\" Boehner said.\n\nThe last time Congress passed a bill establishing a series of minimum wage increases was in 2007, before the Great Recession began. The last of those increases took the pay up to $7.25, where it has remained frozen. Nineteen states, plus the District of Columbia, have minimum wages above $7.25. If the federal level were to rise, many of those states would likely pass new legislation to exceed it.\n\nThe minimum wage has been a contentious issue since its introduction in 1938. Business groups argue that a federal minimum wage is inflationary and represents an unnecessary government intervention in the labor market. They contend that labor supply and demand alone should set wages, not lawmakers.\n\nSupporters, on the other hand, argue that a higher minimum wage reduces income inequality and puts more money into the hands of consumers, who can spend it. The argument is that while a business owner might have to spend more on payroll under new wage legislation, they would also see a boost in revenues as customers find themselves enjoying bigger paydays.\n\nThe minimum wage debate is likely to continue as both sides present their arguments and evidence. The outcome remains uncertain, but the president's proposal has certainly added a new dimension to the ongoing discussion.",
    " Title: Relatives of Original Aunt Jemima Models Express Concern Over Brand's Rebranding\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relatives of two women who portrayed the iconic Aunt Jemima character in the 1920s and 1930s have expressed disapproval of Quaker Oats' decision to rebrand the product amid accusations that the image is a racist depiction, according to various news sources.\n\nLarnell Evans Sr., a great-grandson of Anna Short Harrington, who portrayed Aunt Jemima, told Patch, \"This is an injustice for me and my family. This is part of my history.\" Harrington, who was discovered at the New York State Fair in 1935, portrayed Aunt Jemima for 25 years.\n\nCritics argue that Aunt Jemima is based on a racial stereotype. Quaker Oats announced the removal of the image on June 17, stating that it was part of an effort \"to make progress toward racial equality\" (RELATED: Quaker Announces Name Change, Logo Removal from Aunt Jemima Brand).\n\nEvans expressed disappointment over the rebranding, stating, \"She worked 25 years doing it. She improved their product... what they're trying to do is ludicrous.\"\n\nThe family of Lillian Richard, who became an ambassador for the brand after being discovered by the company in Dallas, also shares similar concerns. Vera Harris, Richard's great niece, said, \"We just don't want my aunt's legacy\u2014what she did making an honest living at the time\u2014to be wiped away.\"\n\nHarris and her family have spearheaded multiple efforts to honor Richard, including putting signs leading to Hawkins, Texas that read \"Home of Lillian Richard'Aunt Jemima,' \" according to NBC. Harris and her family understand the reasoning behind Quaker Oats' decision but are proud of Richard's honest living and want to honor her legacy.\n\nBoth families are hurt that their relatives' histories are being erased. Evans told Patch, \"The racism they talk about, using images from slavery, that comes from the other side\u2014white people. This company profits off images of our slavery. And their answer is to erase my great-grandmother's history. A black female... It hurts.\"\n\nEvans and Harris believe that erasing their relatives' histories will erase part of African American history and hinder future progress. Harris told Fox 6, \"If we wipe out our history, we have nothing to strive for in the future. Our history will help us prosper in the future.\"",
    " Title: Conservative Group Launches Radio Ad Urging McConnell to Oppose Funding for Obamacare, Triggering Potential Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nA conservative political action committee, the Senate Conservatives Fund, has initiated a radio advertisement campaign challenging Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to oppose any funding for President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, even if it leads to a government shutdown. The ad will air starting Tuesday in Kentucky, where McConnell is currently vying for a sixth term.\n\nThe 60-second commercial questions McConnell's commitment to defunding the health care law, stating, \"Republicans in Congress can stop Obamacare by refusing to fund it, but Senator Mitch McConnell refuses to lead the fight.\" The ad also references a recent campaign controversy involving McConnell's campaign manager, Jesse Benton, who was heard on an audio recording saying he was \"holding my nose\" while working for the candidate.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint, is investing close to $200,000 in radio ads in six other states, targeting GOP senators such as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nThe issue of defunding the Affordable Care Act has created a divide within the Republican party, with House and Senate GOP leaders expressing concerns about the political implications of a government shutdown, while tea party conservatives remain determined to undermine the health care law. The federal fiscal year ends on September 30, and new appropriations are required to avoid a shutdown of various government offices and agencies.\n\nIn addition to the Senate Conservatives Fund, another conservative group, the Madison Project, launched a radio spot on Monday criticizing McConnell, labeling him a \"career Washington politician\" who claims to be a conservative. The Madison Project is supporting McConnell's primary rival, businessman Matt Bevin.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund has not officially endorsed in the Kentucky GOP primary, but in a July statement, executive director Matt Hoskins expressed openness to backing Bevin. Hoskins suggested that McConnell could lose the Senate race and jeopardize the GOP's chance at a Senate majority. The group stated it was \"waiting to see if the grassroots in Kentucky unite\" behind Bevin.",
    " Title: Tillerson Urges Russia to Cooperate on Syria, Suggests Joint Mechanisms for Stability\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Russia to do more to bring peace to Syria and suggested that Moscow and Washington could cooperate on establishing no-fly zones in the war-torn Arab country. The statement came just days before President Donald Trump is to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 gathering in Germany.\n\nTillerson's statement followed a report that he had told the U.N. chief that Syrian President Bashar Assad's fate was in Russia's hands. The U.S. Secretary of State also warned the Syrian regime against taking advantage of America's limited focus by moving into areas freed from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\n\"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-ground cease-fire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" Tillerson said. He added that such cooperation could lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria's political future.\n\nTillerson also emphasized that America's top priority in Syria remains defeating the Islamic State terrorist network. He called on all parties, including the Syrian government and its allies, Syrian opposition forces, and Coalition forces carrying out the battle to defeat ISIS, to avoid conflict with one another and adhere to agreed geographical boundaries for military de-confliction and protocols for de-escalation.\n\nThe Trump administration has grappled with a strategy on how to deal with Syria once the Islamic State is pushed out of its territory there. America's successful military campaign against the terrorist group, which involves partnering with local forces, has suddenly given new space to Assad's forces and those of Iran and Russia to operate, leading to clashes with the United States. In one case, the U.S. shot down a Syrian government aircraft.\n\nTrump's meeting with Putin is expected to cover a range of issues beyond Syria, including Moscow's designs on Ukraine. It is not yet clear whether Trump will raise another sensitive issue: U.S. intelligence agencies' suspicions that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win. The U.S. president has in the past downplayed those allegations.",
    " Title: Post-Debate Reflections: Clinton and Trump Take Different Tones After First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the highly anticipated first presidential debate of the 2016 election, both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump took different tones as they reflected on the previous night's event.\n\nClinton and her team, who appeared to be riding high, showcased signs of victory. The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. A smiling Clinton walked to the back of the plane to express her satisfaction with the debate, stating, \"One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Let's play two.' I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that.\"\n\nIn contrast, Trump did not seem to be having a good morning. Calling into Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" early Tuesday, Trump expressed multiple complaints about the debate. Trump's first target was the debate's moderator, NBC News' Lester Holt, whom he had praised just hours before. Trump criticized Holt for not asking Clinton about her emails, scandals, and the Benghazi incident.\n\nTrump also continued to express dissatisfaction with his microphone, suggesting that it may have been intentionally set up to malfunction. To add to his complaints, Trump made crude comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that Trump's disparaging treatment of her led to eating disorders and depression.\n\nThese remarks could prove detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. Clinton's campaign released a new video featuring Machado, in which she recounts Trump's derogatory comments. Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton.\n\nSpeaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, stating, \"What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter.\"\n\nRetired 68-year-old Marguerite Scott, a woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, was struck by Trump's apparent loss of composure during the debate. Scott also criticized the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado, stating, \"Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Death Toll from COVID-19 Surpasses 18,600 as Experts Urge Americans to Observe Easter Holidays at Home\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - As the United States death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 18,600, political leaders and health experts urged Americans celebrating Good Friday and the Easter weekend to avoid church gatherings and observe the holidays at home. The U.S. has by far the most confirmed cases of COVID-19, with at least 500,000 known infections and more than 18,600 deaths.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, and other health officials pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units as signs that social distancing measures are paying off. \"Now is no time to back off,\" Fauci told CNN on Friday. \"The virus will decide\" when the country can begin to reopen from state-at-home orders imposed in recent weeks across 42 states.\n\nThe Trump administration renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model this week lowered its U.S. mortality forecasts to 60,000 deaths by Aug. 4, from at least 100,000, assuming that social-distancing measures remain in place. However, the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services project the death toll could reach 200,000 if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days.\n\nPrisons and jails, along with nursing homes and other institutions with large populations confined in close quarters, have proven especially vulnerable to outbreaks, with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Illinois, New York, and Louisiana. On Friday, officials reported 68 residents and two staff members at a San Francisco homeless shelter had tested positive, marking one of the largest known clusters of coronavirus infections yet in such a facility anywhere in the country.\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- Trump orders U.S. government to help Italy in coronavirus fight\n- The outbreak in Italy seems at odds with promising data presented by California Governor Gavin Newsom showing that social distancing has worked so far to flatten the arc of infections in his state.\n- New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic with some 7,800 deaths to date, likewise has seen glimmers of hope this week.\n- After three days of record daily deaths, New York state's COVID-19 toll from April 9 stood at 777, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday.\n- New York's ICU admissions declined \"for the first time since we started this journey,\" he said.\n- In Michigan, more than 200 people died from COVID-19 in the last day. \"We are not out of the woods yet,\" Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.\n- At his daily White House briefing, President Donald Trump said he was receiving fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.\n\nAs more than 90% of the country remains under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast to congregants watching from home. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshipers.\n\n\"We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children's Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can't do any of that this year,\" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy lamented to reporters.\n\n\"I'm really missing the community aspect of being with everyone,\" said Rebecca Swindle, a 26-year-old mother of two in central Florida whose church began holding virtual services five weeks ago to help curb coronavirus transmission.\n\nSwindle said she planned to watch a livestream of Good Friday evening prayers - normally \"a huge gathering of worshiping God\" - and to promote her church's online Easter service on her Facebook profile.\n\nOne megachurch in South Carolina turned to the model of once-popular drive-in movies, presenting services filmed live and shown on a big screen with the audio broadcast over the radio to worshipers in their cars.\n\nA handful of holdout U.S. churches planned to go ahead with in-person Easter Sunday services, saying their rights to worship outweighed public health warnings.\n\n\"Satan and a virus will not stop us,\" said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday.\n\nFriday also ended another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues, and schools shuttered across the nation. In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive.\n\n\"This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,\" said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. \"It's continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.\"\n\nAt the other end of the food supply chain, a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, owned by meatpacking company JBS USA said it would spend more than $1 million for coronavirus testing kits to screen its workers after 36 employees became infected. Two employees have died of COVID-19, according to the union representing workers at the plant. The company said it was shutting down over the holiday weekend to \"further enhance previously announced deep cleaning efforts at the facility.\"\n\nNew York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported COVID-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population. African Americans comprise 70% of Louisiana's coronavirus deaths but only a third of its population, said Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.",

He told reporters that data from the trial showed a \"clear-cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.\"\n\nTrump has previously touted Gilead's remdesivir as a potential treatment for the virus, which has infected over 3.1 million people worldwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While multiple studies are testing the drug to determine its effectiveness in stopping the coronavirus from replicating, it is not yet a proven treatment.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump called the disclosed results from Fauci a \"very big thing\" and a \"building block\" in the fight against the virus. \"I want them to go as quickly as they can,\" he said, praising FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for his swift actions.\n\nFauci reported that the median time of recovery for patients taking the drug was 11 days, compared with 15 days in the placebo group. He noted that the mortality benefit of remdesivir \"has not yet reached statistical significance.\"\n\nThe results suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group, according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health released Wednesday.\n\n\"This will be the standard of care,\" Fauci added. \"When you know a drug works, you have to let people in the placebo group know so they can take it.\"\n\n\"What it has proven is a drug can block this virus,\" he concluded. The FDA's decision on the approval of remdesivir is still pending.",

The editorial board wrote, \"It's beyond his capacity in the upcoming 90-minute question-and-answer sessions to reverse or even substantially modify that conclusion.\"\n\nThe first formal debate between Trump and Clinton is scheduled for Monday night at Hofstra University in New York. The debate comes as Trump narrows the gap with Clinton in national polls and leads her in key battleground states. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Monday morning showed a virtual tie, with Clinton edging Trump among likely voters 44-43 percent.\n\nThe Trump campaign has dismissed the views of The New York Times' editorial board. In response to the newspaper's Clinton endorsement over the weekend, Trump spokesman Jason Miller issued a statement saying, \"The news that the ultra-liberal, elitist, out-of-touch New York Times Editorial Board endorsed an ultra-liberal, elitist, out-of-touch candidate in Hillary Clinton has to be some of the least surprising news ever. The New York Times' Editorial Board is the embodiment of the rigged system Donald Trump is running against.\"\n\nThe statement was titled, \"The Sun Also Rose In The East This Morning.\" The first presidential debate is expected to be a pivotal moment in the 2016 election, with both candidates aiming to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Refuses to Halt Texas Abortion Law, Divides Justices\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to halt the implementation of a contentious Texas abortion law, with four justices dissenting. The law requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.\n\nThe decision follows a federal appeals court's reinstatement of the law, which is considered one of the most restrictive in the country. Abortion-rights groups, who claim that more than a third of Texas clinics providing abortions have closed since the law's implementation, had asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling.\n\nIn his statement supporting the order, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, \"Reasonable minds can perhaps disagree about whether the Court of Appeals should have granted a stay in this case. But there is no doubt that the applicants have not carried their heavy burden of showing that doing so was a clear violation of accepted legal standards.\"\n\nFour justices - Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan - dissented. The original lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas, alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.\n\nState Senator Wendy Davis, who led a Democratic filibuster to block the bill's initial approval, criticized the decision, stating, \"Clinics will close and women's health will be hurt because of this law. This is an abuse of power by politicians in Austin.\"\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry, on the other hand, praised the decision, saying, \"This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions.\" Perry added, \"As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state.\"",

The meetings also served as a platform to showcase the party's efforts to reach out to new voters, particularly young people, minorities, and women.\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a conservative African-American businessman, was the keynote speaker for Friday's luncheon. Scott, who embodies the party's rebranding effort, emphasized the importance of embracing new voters and maximizing their potential.\n\nHowever, the three-day Republican National Committee (RNC) meetings saw some mixed messages regarding outreach to new voters. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, in a speech, stirred controversy by discussing women's issues, suggesting that the Democrats were insulting women by providing them with government-funded birth control.\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus reacted cautiously to Huckabee's comments, stating, \"I don't know what he was talking about... What I can tell you is that I think he was trying to make the comment that government cannot be involved in every part of everyone's life.\"\n\nLouisiana's Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere acknowledged progress in the party's rebranding efforts but denied that Republicans have a problem with women or minorities. He suggested that the party needs to articulate its positions better and show minorities that they can thrive within the Republican Party.\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, the party aims to shorten the presidential primary season, with the primary season likely beginning in February and wrapping up as early as May. RNC Chairman Priebus stated that the last primary cycle, which included numerous GOP debates, was damaging to the nominee and the party.\n\nThere was also discussion at this Republican gathering about the likely Democratic nominee, with Hillary Clinton often referred to as \"she who must not be named.\"\n\nThe article concludes with a neutral, factual, and informative tone, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of the Republican Party's 2016 presidential primary rules and outreach efforts as discussed at their winter meetings.",
    " Title: The Future of Schengen: A Look at the European Union's Borderless Travel Amidst Refugee Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of the European Union's (EU) inability to enforce a mandatory refugee quota, concerns have been raised about the future of Schengen, the continent's flagship achievement of borderless travel. However, experts suggest that the Schengen Agreement, which allows for seamless movement within the 26-nation zone, is likely to remain intact for the foreseeable future.\n\nGermany's decision to temporarily impose border checks on its frontier with Austria was prompted by the record influx of asylum seekers arriving through Munich's central train station. The move was also seen as a tactical measure to pressure resistant EU members to accept their responsibility in providing refuge to those fleeing war. However, this action has led to other countries, such as Austria, Slovakia, and the Netherlands, to consider imposing their own border controls.\n\nWith no robust EU plan in place for the record number of refugees entering the bloc, other countries are studying whether they need to impose emergency controls as well. This has sparked discussions about the potential \"death\" of Schengen, signed in 1985 and in operation for 20 years. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's chief of staff tweeted on Sunday, \"Schengen will be in danger if EU member states do not work together swiftly and with solidarity on managing the refugee crisis.\"\n\nHowever, there are several reasons why Schengen is likely to withstand the pressure. The controls being implemented today, though unprecedented in scale, were envisioned when the zone was formed. If members see \"a serious threat to public policy or international security,\" they can put up controls temporarily. These temporary measures are not likely to impact the majority of travelers, as borders are not actually closed down. Rather, there are spot checks at certain crossings, though this may imply a degree of racial profiling, as they are seeking to control those fleeing war or poverty in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAndr\u00e1s R\u00e1cz, senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, states, \"I don't think Germany would have collapsed under the pressure of asylum seekers. They are not overburdening Germany as a whole.\" Many do not see Schengen as the problem, but rather view it as a symptom and a scapegoat. The system seen in greater need of repair is the so-called \"Dublin regulation,\" a policy that mandates asylum seekers to register in the first EU country they enter.\n\nThe question of European jihadis, who can travel freely within the Schengen zone, has fueled concerns about the risks associated with borderless travel. However, in many cases, getting rid of Schengen does not solve the core problems. Terrorism is a threat to countries inside and outside the Schengen zone, including Britain. While passport checks are eliminated under Schengen, national police forces can still check travelers.\n\nRevoking Schengen would require setting up passport controls, staff, and equipment, a cost that most nations would not be willing to assume. Costs to businesses, with trucks waiting in lines at borders, would also be exorbitant. Nor would many people, accustomed to traveling abroad without passports or the hassles of passport checks, willingly let go of such perks.\n\nHeavy flows of asylum seekers are not going to dissipate. This summer has set records, and while winter will reduce the numbers temporarily, the migration trail will likely fill up again in the spring due to the intractable conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. James Davis, director of the Institute of Political Science at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, argues that Europe needs both a common policy on refugees and a plan to stop the flow of economic migrants. Otherwise, controls will continue to be imposed, and Europeans, despite themselves, might just get used to them.\n\n\"If we don't get a European common approach to these questions by end of next year, Schengen is dead,\" Davis concludes. The future of Schengen remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the EU faces a long-term problem that requires a comprehensive and collaborative solution.",

Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.) criticized the concept of religious liberty, stating it is often used as a \"pretext for discrimination.\" Maloney, who is the first openly gay congressman to represent New York state, made these comments during a softball interview celebrating the Supreme Court's recent decision to expand workplace civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nDuring the interview, Maloney took a swipe at Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, who sided with the liberals on the court in the landmark Bostock v. Clayton County case. Despite Gorsuch's support, Maloney expressed skepticism, stating, \"We know that Neil Gorsuch is a supporter of so-called religious liberty, which is a bogus term \u2014 it is actually some sort of pretext for discrimination hiding behind the guise of religion.\"\n\nMaloney's comments echoed similar remarks made during a congressional hearing earlier this year, where he criticized the Trump administration's use of religious liberty to allegedly \"assault\" the rights of LGBTQ Americans. During that hearing, Maloney argued that religious liberty has been \"distorted and twisted into a weapon to enable discrimination,\" particularly in reference to rules allowing faith-based adoption agencies to deny child placement into LGBTQ homes.\n\nAs a father of three children with his husband, Maloney has sponsored a bill that aims to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ families by adoption and foster care agencies. In the past, he has argued that allowing agencies to exclude LGBTQ couples under the guise of religious liberty is to \"sanction discrimination.\"\n\nThe full interview, where Maloney's comments can be heard, is available at the 4:30 mark of the video below.",

Harris, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg have raised campaign funds significantly faster than they spent it in the first quarter of 2019, according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission on Monday.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, who has seen a surge in the polls and raised an impressive $7 million, collected cash 10 times faster than his campaign spent it. He started the second quarter with $6 million in the bank. Lis Smith, Buttigieg's campaign spokeswoman, tweeted, \"That is a remarkably low burn rate and indicative of how we are running a 21st-century campaign, doing more with less.\"\n\nNone of the top-performing Democrats matched President Trump's $30 million haul in the first quarter. However, they demonstrated their potential to compete against the Trump campaign, which was pulling in $4 for every $1 it spent.\n\nSen. Harris seized on Trump's fund-raising prowess to encourage supporters to contribute to her campaign. After collecting $12 million in contributions, the Harris campaign reported spending $4.2 million on operating expenses. With additional cash transferred from her Senate campaign committee, Ms. Harris ended the quarter with $8.9 million in the bank.\n\nSen. Sanders, who remains the frontrunner in the Democrats' money race, raised money nearly four times faster than his campaign spent it. He collected $18 million and ended the quarter with a more than $15.6 million war chest.\n\nAaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, noted that high burn rates are common in first-quarter reports due to start-up costs, including the expense of setting up national fund-raising operations. He added that candidates with lower burn rates, such as Ms. Harris and Mr. Sanders, are likely to be efficient in their fundraising at this point.\n\nCandidates are heavily dependent on online fundraising through ActBlue, a portal that allows donors to funnel their contributions. Ms. Harris reported 14,000 itemized contributions through ActBlue, totaling $9.2 million. Mr. Sanders recorded $17.1 million across more than 26,600 donations facilitated by ActBlue.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised $6 million in the first three months of 2019 and spent it just as fast. Her campaign doled out about $5.2 million, according to the federal filing. She had $11 million in the bank thanks to $10 million transferred from her Senate campaign committee.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has struggled at 1 percent or less in the polls, also spent money as fast as her campaign could raise it. With just under $3 million in contributions, the Gillibrand campaign spent $2.4 million. Though her campaign reported no debts, the bulk of Ms. Gillibrand's funds\u2014$9.6 million\u2014were transferred from her Senate campaign.\n\nMillionaire and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney also spent as much as he raised. His campaign is buoyed by an $11 million of his own money. By comparison, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro collected contributions twice as fast as he spent the money but took in just $1.1 million.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee raised more than $2 million in the month since announcing his presidential run and spent less than half\u2014$843,000\u2014to launch his run. His seven-figure total and low burn rate provided a bright spot for Mr. Inslee, who is running on an agenda singularly focused on climate change and barely registers in the polls.\n\n\"This first-month fundraising shows strong grassroots momentum for Gov. Inslee's message of defeating climate change,\" said Inslee campaign manager Aisling Kerins.",
    " Title: \"Trump's Media Strategy: A Blend of Bombast, Amorality, and Self-Promotion\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heat of the 2016 Republican primary, Donald Trump, known for his bombastic style, amorality, and media savvy, has proven his ability to dominate coverage and dictate the narrative, securing the Republican nomination. His entire career, a TV man with a gift for self-promotion, has been a preparation for this moment, this campaign.\n\nTrump's candidacy, a calamity for many, is not only the result of the Republican Party's welcoming him into their big tent but also the media's failure to hold him accountable. The media, with a special obligation in a free society, has failed spectacularly this election.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Columbia journalism professor Todd Gitlin noted that Trump has \"cracked the campaign reporters' code.\" Gitlin writes, \"Trump regularly runs circles around interviewers because they pare their follow-up questions down to a minimum, or none at all. After 30-plus years in the media spotlight, he knows how to wait out an interviewer, offering noncommittal soundbites and incoherent rejoinders until he hears the phrase, 'let's move on.'\"\n\nExamples of this abound, with Trump evading questions he can't answer or when reporters suggest, however passively, that he's wrong or lied about the record. \"Trump is a master of darting from slogan to slogan,\" Gitlin writes. \"That's why interviewers must do their homework and be prepared to go at least 2-3 questions deep on any issue.\"\n\nHowever, it's difficult to dive deep when interviewers are forced to shoehorn serious questions in limited time between competing toothpaste commercials. Trump gets away with this because of the mutually beneficial relationship he has with the press. He knows people like Les Moonves, the CEO and executive chairman of CBS, are interested in selling penis pill ads, not informing the electorate.\n\nVoters, for their part, are happy to project whatever they want onto the empty vessel that is Trump. Meanwhile, the truth is an afterthought, and the whole sordid circus continues unimpeded. Gitlin urges journalists \"to honor the good name of their profession and take off the kid gloves.\" Sound advice, but I'm not holding my breath.",
    " Title: A Call for National Security: An Analysis of Donald Trump's Immigration Policy Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention, a heated debate on immigration policy has emerged, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposing a temporary halt in immigration from countries known to support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups. This article aims to provide an unbiased analysis of Trump's proposal, its implications, and the broader context of the ongoing global struggle against terrorism.\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nAs the nation grapples with the complexities of national security and immigration, Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention has sparked a significant debate on immigration policy. In his address, Trump emphasized the need for strong measures to protect the United States from the threat of radical Islam, citing the ongoing global terror crisis.\n\nTrump's proposal, in essence, calls for a temporary halt in immigration from countries that are known to support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups. This measure is not without precedent, as the U.S. has previously implemented similar restrictions during wartime.\n\nThe crux of Trump's argument lies in the difficulty of vetting large numbers of refugees and immigrants from war-torn regions like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The sheer volume of individuals seeking asylum, coupled with the complexity of their backgrounds, makes it challenging for U.S. immigration authorities to determine the true intentions of these individuals.\n\nThis proposal has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it infringes on the principles of freedom and openness that define the United States. However, supporters of Trump's plan argue that it is a pragmatic response to the current global security situation, particularly in light of the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe.\n\nIt is essential to understand the context in which this proposal is being made. The world is currently grappling with a surge in terrorist activities, with groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda actively seeking to destabilize the Judeo-Christian culture and way of life. The threat is not abstract; it is a reality that has claimed countless innocent lives across the globe.\n\nTrump's proposal is not a blanket ban on immigration but a call for increased vigilance and caution in the face of an unprecedented security challenge. It is a call to prioritize the safety and security of American citizens over the desire for open borders.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on immigration policy is a complex and nuanced one. It is crucial to approach this issue with a clear understanding of the challenges and threats facing the nation. Trump's proposal, while controversial, is a reflection of the realities of the current global security landscape. It is a call for pragmatism, caution, and a renewed commitment to the safety and security of the American people.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Julian Assange Extradition: A Closer Look at the US Case Against WikiLeaks Founder\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was extradited from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday. The extradition marks a significant step in the long-standing case the US has been pursuing against him, with the US seeking his extradition over the publication of classified military and diplomatic files provided by Chelsea Manning, the army whistleblower.\n\nThe indictment, which unveiled shocking US abuses and shed light on corrupt and repressive governments worldwide, has been a subject of intense debate. The material, published by various media outlets, including WikiLeaks, the New York Times, and others, was undeniably important. However, there was strong disagreement over Assange's decision to bulk-publish unredacted documents.\n\nTwo obstacles initially paused the US pursuit. The first was Ecuador's decision to grant Assange asylum, a decision that has since been rescinded following a change in government. The second was the Obama administration's conclusion that pursuing Assange for publishing the files would set a dangerous precedent, potentially imperiling press freedoms protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAs a candidate, Donald Trump declared his support for WikiLeaks when the organization published emails stolen by Russian state hackers from the Democratic National Committee. However, six months later, after WikiLeaks released information on the CIA's hacking operations, the service's then-director, Mike Pompeo, declared it a \"hostile intelligence service,\" and the US described arresting Assange as a priority.\n\nUS authorities are charging Assange on the grounds of conspiracy to access a computer, rather than for the publication of the material obtained. This is an important distinction. The high court last year ruled against the extradition of Lauri Love, accused of breaking into US government websites, in a judgment hailed as setting a precedent for trying hacking suspects in the UK. However, the circumstances were very different. The US may also add further charges to the sheet.\n\nIt would be naive to regard this charge as the sole cause of the extradition request, rather than the technical grounds for it. Assange is accused in this case of assisting in the cracking of a password, but many fear that the conspiracy charge could be more broadly applied, particularly by an administration so hostile to a free, independent press.\n\nAssange now faces up to a year in prison for skipping bail. He entered the Ecuadorian embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced allegations of rape and molestation (which he denies), citing fears that Stockholm would hand him to the US. It would be entirely appropriate for Swedish prosecutors to reopen their investigation, as the lawyer representing one of his accusers has requested.\n\nNone of this alters the dangers of agreeing to his extradition to the US. The case against Assange is complex and multifaceted, and it is crucial to consider the implications of his extradition on press freedoms and the future of investigative journalism.",
    " Title: Republican Donors and Strategists Grapple with Trump's Appeal and the Challenges of Countering His Influence\n\nIn an interview, political strategist Mr. McIntosh expressed concern about the appeal of Donald Trump among conservative Republican voters, stating, \"A wonkish explanation that trade is actually good for the country probably won't assuage them.\" This sentiment was echoed by several Republican donors and strategists who appear increasingly worried about the impact Trump has on the party and its activist base.\n\nAndy Sabin, a New York supporter of Jeb Bush, noted that discussions about Trump have been a recurring topic at summer fundraising events in the Hamptons. Sabin, who is also a donor to American Crossroads, the Republican Party's leading super PAC, described Trump as a divisive figure, \"He's been a topic, and he obviously disgusts a lot of people because he's been vile,\" he said. \"But he's also been able to bring out what people feel about their government.\"\n\nThe challenge of countering Trump's influence is daunting, with the cost of an anti-Trump campaign estimated to be as high as $20 million. Reshaping opinions about Trump, a candidate with universal name recognition and a talent for generating free media coverage, could require such a significant investment. A sustained campaign aimed at Fox News viewers could cost $2 million per week, according to one Republican consultant working for a rival candidate, while a more targeted effort, focused on Iowa caucus-goers later this fall, could require up to $10 million.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee of success. A group aligned with the Republican establishment risks engaging in a war with Trump, while a new group, such as a political nonprofit, could face scrutiny for accepting secret donations. Trump has also begun to preview such attacks, further complicating efforts to counter his influence. The Republican Party and its donors are now faced with the challenge of finding a strategy to address Trump's appeal while minimizing the potential damage to the party and its candidates.",
    " Title: Former DOJ Officials Call for Resignation of Attorney General Barr Over Stone Case Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of more than 1,100 former prosecutors and officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) have called for the resignation of Attorney General Bill Barr following his intervention in the case of Roger Stone, a longtime friend and adviser to President Donald Trump. In an open letter, the former DOJ employees expressed outrage at Barr's intervention after Trump tweeted his disapproval of the nine-year sentence recommended by prosecutors in the case where Stone had been convicted of seven felonies.\n\nThe letter, signed by former DOJ employees from both Democratic and Republican administrations, accused Barr of acting on Trump's \"personal bidding\" and causing damage to the Department of Justice's reputation for integrity and the rule of law. The former Justice Department employees argued that Barr's actions were counter to the established procedural norms of the DOJ.\n\nThe Department has a long-standing practice in which political appointees set broad policies that line prosecutors apply to individual cases. This practice exists to animate the constitutional principles regarding the even-handed application of the law, the former Justice employees wrote. They added that it is unheard of for the Department's top leaders to overrule line prosecutors, who are following established policies, in order to give preferential treatment to a close associate of the President, as Attorney General Barr did in the Stone case.\n\nThe officials offered their support for the four prosecutors who resigned from the case. Since they considered Barr's resignation unlikely, the signatories suggested alternative means of expressing dissent and resisting inappropriate influence from the Trump White House. They called on every DOJ employee to follow their heroic example and be prepared to report future abuses to the Inspector General, the Office of Professional Responsibility, and Congress. They also urged employees to refuse to carry out directives that are inconsistent with their oaths of office, to withdraw from cases that involve such directives or other misconduct, and, if necessary, to resign and report publicly\u2014in a manner consistent with professional ethics\u2014to the American people the reasons for their resignation.",
    " Title: Tea Party Vows to Remain Active in Politics Despite Election Setbacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent elections, tea party leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to the movement, stating they will not be scapegoated for the Republican Party's losses. They argue that it was the party establishment, not the tea party, that led to the Republican losses in the House and Senate and President Obama's re-election.\n\nAmy Kremer, leader of the Tea Party Express, asserted, \"As far as the tea party is concerned, we are still here. We may not be out on the streets with the colorful signs like 2010, but we are here, we are engaged, and we are going to continue to fight. We never thought this was a short-term process. It is going to take a long time to turn it around.\"\n\nJudson Phillips, head of Tea Party Nation, emphasized the need for the tea party to counteract Republicans who are trying to blame the movement for the poor election results. Phillips specifically criticized Karl Rove, stating, \"They went well out of their way to ignore us, marginalize us, and pretend we did not exist, and they gave us the most liberal nominee in the history of the Republican Party.\"\n\nKeli Carender, national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots, also expressed her belief that Republicans are trying to blame the tea party. Carender stated, \"We tried the last four years to go from the top and working with Congress. I think we have not been as successful as we like. It is an impermeable steel bubble. We are really, really realizing that in order to have an impact, it is going to have to come from the ground up\u2014from the cities, the counties, and the states.\"\n\nThe tea party made a significant impact in the 2010 midterm elections, knocking off veteran Republican lawmakers and sending a new class of fiscal conservatives to Capitol Hill. However, the election this year proved to be a mixed bag for tea party-supported candidates, with some high-profile losses in conservative states.\n\nThe tea party's future focus will be on local elections, with the movement aiming to reassert itself on both local and national levels as Congress begins negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff.\" The primary goal of the tea party in the coming weeks is to ensure that House Republicans do not surrender during these negotiations, with a focus on opposing new tax increases and cutting spending.",
    " Title: Post-Debate Analysis: Obama and Romney's Debate Performance and the Road Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the first presidential debate, both the Obama and Romney campaigns have expressed differing views on the performance of their respective candidates. David Axelrod, a senior advisor to President Obama, stated, \"Not surprisingly, what we learned is he'll say anything. That makes him effective in the short term but vulnerable in the long term.\" He added, \"He may win the Oscar for his performance last night, but he's not going to win the presidency.\"\n\nThe Romney team, feeling rejuvenated, responded, \"In full damage-control mode, President Obama today offered no defense of his record and no vision for the future,\" said Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman. \"Rather than a plan to fix our economy, President Obama simply offered more false attacks and renewed his call for job-killing tax hikes.\"\n\nThe Obama team, in an attempt to turn the tables on Mitt Romney, was hoping to salvage a debate performance widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike. Aides described President Obama as out of practice at debating and said he made a conscious decision not to bring up some of the campaign's favorite attack lines of recent months, a decision they left little doubt disappointed them.\n\nNow, they will have to make what Mr. Axelrod called \"adjustments\" in the president's approach for the next debate on Oct. 16. The \"take-away from this debate,\" he said, was that they \"can't allow someone to stand there and manhandle the truth.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Mitt Romney softened his rhetoric, promising that his reform of Medicare would not touch benefits for older Americans and praising elements of Mr. Obama's education policy. He also tried to paint the president as a protector of big banks because of the post-financial-crisis government bailout of the banking industry.\n\nCampaign officials said they wished Mr. Obama had called out Mr. Romney on assertions that they said were untrue, although they conceded that some of the weaknesses in the president's performance were simply part of his approach to debates, which is to shy away from highly personal confrontations. The base wants him \"to gut Romney,\" one adviser said, but swing voters hate that, and the president was trying to find a balance.\n\nDemocrats questioned why he did not bring up a range of issues they considered favorable to Mr. Obama, including women's rights, Mr. Romney's taxes, the Republican candidate's comments about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who consider themselves \"victims\" dependent on the government, and the record of his former firm, Bain Capital. Some Colorado Democrats leaving the debate seemed despondent at the president's performance and fretted that he had put their state back in play.\n\nFormer Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, a close ally of the campaign, said in an interview, \"The president did well in terms of substance but I think there were opportunities to hold Governor Romney accountable that may have been missed.\" He added, \"But you know, it's one debate. There are two more.\"\n\nOther Democrats picked up what they saw as Mr. Obama's missed opportunities, assailing Mr. Romney for misleading viewers about his tax plan and other issues. The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning organization, posted what it called \"27 myths\" told in 38 minutes.\n\nA new television ad produced by the Obama campaign for seven swing states showed Mr. Romney denying aspects of his tax plan. \"If we can't trust him here, how could we ever trust him here?\" the ad asks as a picture of the Oval Office comes on screen. \"He was just lying,\" Mr. Strickland said. \"He was fast and loose with the truth.\" The Romney camp countered with the various ways they asserted Mr. Obama misled about the issues during the debate.\n\nAppearing at his morning rally on Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed more energetic than he had the night before. Clad in khakis and a blue Windbreaker, he mocked Mr. Romney in a way he had not during his sober performance on Wednesday night. He singled out Mr. Romney's promise to cut funding for the Public Broadcasting System, including its signature children's character.\n\n\"Thank goodness someone is finally getting tough on Big Bird,\" he said. \"We didn't know Big Bird was driving the federal deficit.\"\n\nSomeone in the crowd shouted, \"Elmo,\" referring to another children's character. \"Elmo too?\" Mr. Obama replied with a laugh.\n\nWith 33 days left, the president now finds himself entering the final month of the campaign trying to get off the defensive and regain his footing. Whether it changes the fundamental dynamics of the campaign remains to be seen. Mr. Obama has outgunned Mr. Romney in advertising in critical states, and it is too early to know if the polls will change in a sustained way. The next big moment on the campaign schedule is next week's debate between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate.",
    " Title: High-Profile Politicians Flock to Las Vegas Amidst Rising Political Hub Status\n\nArticle:\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Known for its glitz, glamour, and the occasional political scandal, Las Vegas has proven to be a popular destination for high-profile politicians, despite its reputation as a city of debauchery. This is evident in the increasing number of candidates, political groups, and events making their way to the city, drawn by the combination of campaign cash, industry gatherings, and relaxation.\n\nAccording to a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission data, political committees and parties have spent over $330,000 this election cycle at top hotels and restaurants on and near The Strip. Notable out-of-state spenders include Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Aaron Schock of Illinois, and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nPoliticians, political committees, and parties often risk the taboo associated with visits to the U.S. capital of debauchery, but sometimes prefer to keep a low profile. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican in a tight reelection race against Jimmy Carter's grandson, recently visited the city for a 48-hour trip, including a closed-door speech to a group of GOP lawyers and a secret meeting with billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.\n\nDeal reportedly met with Adelson in his Venetian Resort Hotel Casino office suite on Sunday afternoon, but he initially denied any plans to meet with the billionaire. However, neither Deal's campaign nor Adelson's spokesman have confirmed the meeting.\n\nSimilarly, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi avoided media scrutiny during a closed-door high-dollar fundraiser for Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford and congressional candidate Erin Bilbray at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant Spago in the Caesars Palace complex.\n\nIn contrast, Pelosi's primary opponent, Cresent Hardy, held a fundraiser at a Sparks, Nevada, watering hole called the Coney Island Bar, a venue popular among blue-collar workers.\n\nBefore the fundraiser, Pelosi gave a speech at the United Steelworkers convention, accusing Republicans of using unlimited \"dark money\" to try to buy the election and \"stall the middle class.\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic Rep. Mike Michaud, who is running for governor in Maine, also spoke to the 2,500 steelworkers who gathered for the convention at the MGM Grand.\n\nIn three weeks, Reid is hosting his seventh annual Clean Energy Summit, where former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will deliver the keynote. Jon Huntsman, John Podesta, and Tom Vilsack are also set to speak. Reid has leveraged his political influence to make the event, and his home state more generally, a major draw for Democrats. Former President Bill Clinton, who has delivered speeches to numerous Vegas gatherings in recent years, keynoted Reid's summit in 2012. This year's edition is being held at the Mandalay Bay, where Hillary Clinton's last appearance, an April speech to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, was interrupted by a shoe thrown from the audience.\n\nClinton is also scheduled to speak at the University of Nevada Las Vegas in October, and there are rumors of her headlining a fall fundraiser for the state party. The city's status as a political hub continues to rise, despite its withdrawal from consideration to host the 2016 GOP convention under pressure from social conservatives.",
    " Title: NRA Launches Ad Campaign to Oppose Biden's Gun Control Proposals as Obama Administration Pushes for Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to counter Vice President Joe Biden's efforts to garner support for his gun control proposals, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has launched a new ad campaign across five key states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, and West Virginia. The ad, titled \"Will Obama's gun control proposals work? His own experts say 'No,'\" questions the effectiveness of certain gun control measures, such as restricting large capacity magazines, universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and gun buyback programs.\n\nThe ad campaign is aimed at states that are home to several Democratic senators facing tough re-election battles, including Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina. The NRA is also targeting West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller is retiring, and Maine, where moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for re-election next year.\n\nThe NRA is investing approximately $350,000 in this campaign, which includes local newspaper ads, regional ads, and online commercials. The ads encourage readers to call their senators and oppose Obama's gun control proposals.\n\nThe NRA's ads reference a January internal Justice Department memo, titled \"Summary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies,\" which examines the effectiveness of various gun control measures. The memo, written by the deputy director of the National Institute of Justice, suggests that reducing the availability of large capacity magazines could potentially decrease the total number of homicides, but questions the effectiveness of the 1994 assault weapons ban and a new ban's need for a massive reduction in supply.\n\nThe Obama administration and its supporters argue that the NRA's ad is a misrepresentation of the president's proposals to reduce gun violence. An administration official stated that the ad is based on an incomplete review of gun violence research and does not represent the position of the Department of Justice or the administration. The official also emphasized that the president strongly believes in the Second Amendment and has never supported gun confiscation or a national gun registry.\n\nThe Obama administration and its allies are also working to build public support for the gun control measures and exert leverage. Vice President Biden is scheduled to appear at a gun violence conference in Danbury on Thursday, and he recently held a Facebook town hall with Parents Magazine. The advocacy group Organizing for Action, formed by President Barack Obama's former campaign aides, is urging supporters to demand votes in Congress on the measures and to share their personal stories about gun violence and how to reduce it.\n\nThe NRA has been successful in the past in thwarting gun control legislation by building support at the grassroots level, and the group is focusing much of its efforts in that area currently. The NRA has seen its membership rise to record levels as the gun control debate has intensified following the Newtown school massacre in December. The NRA is also increasing its online ad presence, tripling the buy of a web video run on various news sites. The NRA is airing online ads in 15 states, including Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Many of these states will see competitive Senate races next year.\n\nThe Hill newspaper first reported the new print ad campaign.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Presses Russia for Snowden's Return as Bilateral Summit Canceled\n\nThe Obama administration has reiterated its call for Russia to return fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, despite the cancellation of a planned bilateral summit between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The decision to cancel the meeting, which was initially scheduled for early September, was made in response to deteriorating relations between the two nations.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated on Thursday that the Snowden case is not the primary focus of U.S.-Russia relations, but it remains a priority for the U.S. to have Snowden returned to face criminal charges for revealing classified surveillance programs.\n\nRussia granted Snowden asylum for one year last week, disregarding a personal plea from President Obama. In response, the White House announced the cancellation of the bilateral summit. The developments have sparked criticism that the Obama administration's foreign policy \"reset\" with Russia has collapsed, with some claiming that President Obama was naive to believe President Putin would cooperate on various issues.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton suggested that the U.S. should adopt a firmer stance towards President Putin, describing the cancellation of the summit as \"Obama fluttering his eyelids.\" He argued that the lack of a bilateral meeting with President Obama would cause President Putin distress but would not significantly impact Russian interests.\n\nMr. Carney clarified that the Snowden case was one of several factors contributing to the decision to cancel the meeting. The White House also cited a lack of progress on issues such as Russia's support of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria and negotiations over missile-defense systems in Europe.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F. Kerry will meet with their Russian counterparts on Friday in Washington. Mr. Carney emphasized that the U.S. would continue to engage with Russia, acknowledging it as an important relationship. However, he stated that the timing was not appropriate for a summit.\n\nMr. Carney also addressed questions about a potential U.S. boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in response to a new Russian law that bans \"homosexual propaganda.\" He confirmed that President Obama \"absolutely opposes\" laws that discriminate against individuals for any reason.\n\nDuring a conversation with \"Tonight Show\" host Jay Leno, President Obama expressed his opposition to countries that discriminate against LGBT individuals. He stated, \"I have no patience for countries that try to treat gay or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them.\"\n\nThe ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been a constant challenge, according to Mr. Carney, emphasizing that the U.S. has disagreements with Russia, even during the tenure of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Shift in Stance on Medicare-for-All: A Look Back and Forward\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent speech, former President Barack Obama, known for his criticism of single-payer healthcare during his tenure, has expressed support for the concept, particularly the Medicare-for-All proposal. The former Commander in Chief praised the progressive ideas of the Democratic Party, including Medicare-for-All, in a well-publicized speech.\n\nObama's endorsement of Medicare-for-All, also known as \"single-payer,\" is not a new concept but a long-standing Democratic priority that has yet to be fully implemented. This shift in Obama's stance on the issue highlights two key points relevant to the current Medicare-for-All debate.\n\nFirstly, the Medicare-for-All proposal is not a bright, new idea gaining traction but an age-old Democratic priority that has faced challenges in implementation due to its complexity and potential disruptive effects on the existing healthcare system. Obama's support for single-payer healthcare has fluctuated throughout his political career, with examples of him endorsing the idea as a state senator in Illinois in 2003, only to sour on it during his run for U.S. Senate a year later.\n\nSecondly, the expansion of government's role in healthcare will not necessarily satisfy the demand for more government intervention. Instead, it may escalate the level of government intervention that progressives deem necessary and that conservatives may eventually accept as acceptable.\n\nThe feasibility of implementing Medicare-for-All can also be seen at the state level. In Vermont, a Democratic governor abandoned a single-payer plan after realizing that funding it would require significant increases in income and business taxes.\n\nThe slow and seemingly inevitable government involvement in the healthcare market does not eliminate the practical problems Democrats will face in implementing Medicare-for-All. However, if history is any guide, they will likely have the political capital necessary to attempt its implementation.\n\nThis shift in Obama's stance on Medicare-for-All comes less than two years after he left office, and it is worth noting that the president who gave the Affordable Care Act its name is now advocating for a more extensive government role in healthcare. Conservatives, who initially opposed the Affordable Care Act, have since made their peace with it, opting to preserve some of its key features rather than repealing it outright. The ongoing debate about Medicare-for-All will undoubtedly continue to shape the political landscape in the United States.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Granted More Time by Saudi Arabia to Investigate Disappearance of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift diplomatic maneuver, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been granted a few more days by the Saudi Arabian government to investigate the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The high-level discussions, which took place during Pompeo's emergency trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, have been aimed at shedding light on the mysterious case that has put pressure on the Trump administration.\n\nPompeo, after meeting with top government officials in both countries, briefed President Donald Trump on Thursday, stating that the U.S. takes the matter \"very seriously\" and that the Saudis have assured him they will conduct a \"complete and thorough investigation.\" However, Pompeo did not confirm whether he believes Khashoggi is dead.\n\nThe journalist, a Saudi dissident who obtained U.S. residency last year due to safety concerns, vanished over two weeks ago after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials claim there are gruesome audio and video recordings of Khashoggi being beheaded and dismembered within minutes of entering the compound. The Saudi government has denied any involvement in the journalist's disappearance.\n\nPompeo's visit to the Saudi and Turkish capitals was aimed at seeking answers in the case that has sparked international outrage. Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. has asked Ankara for copies of any evidence of Khashoggi's killing, should it exist.\n\nIn the midst of the diplomatic crisis, Saudi Arabia transferred $100 million to the State Department, a long-promised contribution to help stabilize parts of Syria that have been liberated from the Islamic State. The donation was made as Pompeo landed in Riyadh to meet with Saudi officials.\n\nThe Saudis made the $100 million pledge in August, and the funds were finalized during Pompeo's visit, according to Dan McGurk, the president's special envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.\n\nTrump has suggested that Khashoggi may have been killed by \"rogue killers,\" while pro-government Turkish newspapers have published images of a man believed to be a member of Saudi Arabia's crown prince's entourage entering the Istanbul consulate shortly before Khashoggi disappeared.\n\nPompeo's visit to Turkey and Saudi Arabia comes as the international community calls for answers regarding Khashoggi's disappearance. The Washington Post published the last column written by Khashoggi, which focused on the need for free expression in the Middle East, just days before his disappearance. In the piece, Khashoggi lamented the state of misinformation in the Arab world and the general lack of seriousness regarding freedom of the press.",
    " Title: Republican Senator Ron Johnson Criticizes Obama's Iraq Withdrawal Strategy, Urges More U.S. Aid for Yazidis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV's \"America's Forum,\" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson criticized former President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq without leaving a stabilizing force behind, stating it as an \"incredibly stupid and historic blunder\" that led to the rise of ISIS.\n\nJohnson, a Wisconsin senator, argued that Obama's strategy was based on \"hope and wishful thinking,\" and that such approaches are not effective in military tactics. He made these comments during a discussion on the ongoing humanitarian crisis facing the Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking people whose faith is linked to Zoroastrianism.\n\nISIS considers Yazidis to be devil worshipers due to their belief in seven angels, one named Shaitan, the Quran's name for Satan. According to The New York Times, between 50,000 and 100,000 Yazidis are currently stranded atop Mount Sinjar, fleeing ISIS and facing the threat of death or conversion to Islam.\n\nJohnson expressed concern over the plight of the Yazidis and urged the U.S. to provide more support, both in terms of security and humanitarian assistance. He emphasized the need to support Jordan and ensure the security of Baghdad, stating that the historic blunder of not leaving a stabilizing force behind has put America's national security at greater risk.\n\nThe senator also called for the U.S. to take a more active role in combating ISIS, stating that the group is \"going to commit genocide if they're allowed to continue\" and that they will bring the fight to America. He urged Americans to understand the gravity of the situation, citing the image of an ISIS fighter with a 7-year-old bride as an example of the group's evil intentions.\n\nJohnson concluded by stating that, while nobody wants war, the U.S. cannot ignore the ongoing war on terror. He criticized the Obama administration for being \"way too detached\" from the situation, emphasizing the need for moral clarity and increased U.S. involvement in the region.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Remain Silent on Libya Policy and U.S. Ambassador's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final presidential debate this week provided a platform for Mitt Romney to scrutinize President Obama's foreign policy, particularly in regards to the inconsistencies and lack of clarity in the administration's Libyan intervention. However, both candidates chose to avoid discussing the matter, leaving many questions unanswered regarding the American deaths in Libya.\n\nThe silence from both candidates on this critical issue raises concerns about the administration's accountability and the rule of law. The U.S. military intervention in Libya last year, aimed at removing Col. Qaddafi from power, has been a topic of debate due to the subsequent chaos and the role of Al Qaeda in the region.\n\nPresident Obama has been criticized for his handling of the Libyan intervention, particularly for his claim that he did not require Congressional authorization for the bombing, while seeking approvals from NATO and the Arab League instead. This assertion has been proven false, as American fighter planes and intelligence agents were involved in the operation.\n\nThe U.S. intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of much of the country's infrastructure, including government buildings, police stations, roads, bridges, and the release of prisoners who were previously incarcerated by Qaddafi. This has led to the rise of militias, some of which were involved in the murder of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and his colleagues in September.\n\nThe Obama administration, aware of the Al Qaeda role in the attacks and the unconstitutional nature of the Libyan intervention, sent U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to deliver misleading information to the American public. Rice claimed that the attacks were a result of a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Islamic video, rather than a planned terrorist attack.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that the building where the U.S. personnel were killed was a CIA facility, and that Ambassador Stevens may have been a CIA agent. This raises questions about the role of U.S. intelligence agents in Libya and the protection provided to them.\n\nThe silence from both presidential candidates on this matter is concerning, as it prevents a thorough discussion of the U.S.'s role in foreign conflicts and the protection of American personnel. The public deserves transparency and accountability, especially in matters as grave as the death of U.S. ambassadors and the potential involvement of U.S. intelligence agents in foreign conflicts.",
    " Title: Tension Erupts in Bernie Sanders' Campaign Over Minimum Wage Dispute Among Staff\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure in the fight for labor rights and a proponent of a $15 minimum wage, is facing internal strife within his own campaign over pay disputes among his staff. This development threatens to undermine Sanders' political message and his ability to credibly advocate for workers across the nation currently engaged in their own wage negotiations.\n\nThe discord, initially reported by The Washington Post, reveals that some campaign field staff are frustrated with their base pay, which, in certain instances, does not meet the $15-an-hour minimum wage that Sanders has long advocated for as a legislator and candidate. As the campaign gears up, field staff often work 10-hour, 6-day weeks, resulting in a lower average hourly compensation.\n\nIn response to the report, Sanders defended his campaign's salaries, stating his pride in being the first presidential campaign to unionize workers. He emphasized that the campaign has a historic contract agreement that provides unprecedented protections and benefits. Sanders expressed his intention to address concerns through the bargaining process.\n\nHowever, Sanders expressed frustration in an interview with the Des Moines Register, stating that staffers airing their complaints publicly was not acceptable. He added that it was improper for individuals to damage the integrity of the labor negotiations before they were concluded.\n\nAccording to a source, campaign officials were made aware of the Washington Post's story during negotiations with union representatives. In a statement to CNN, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir revealed that the campaign offered a pay boost to guarantee a $15-an-hour salary for a 60-hour work week. This proposal, according to Shakir, was rejected by the union membership.\n\nShakir stated that the campaign would be limiting the work week for field staff to 40 hours a week. Jonathan Williams, a spokesperson for the UFCW Local 400, declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations but confirmed that the union would continue working with the campaign to address ongoing concerns.\n\nThe leaked details from the negotiations and internal messaging within the campaign emerged at an awkward time for Sanders, who had recently praised the House Democrats for passing the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, which aims to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThe ongoing negotiations between the Sanders campaign and the union representing his field staff, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400, are still active. The ratified collective bargaining agreement, agreed to in early May, set a base pay rate for field staff at $36,000 a year, which works out to under $15 an hour based on a 60-hour work week. However, the CBA also provides full health insurance without a premium, mental health benefits, parental leave options, a gas card for use while on the job, and other benefits not traditionally available to low-level campaign staff.\n\nThe CBA also includes a provision for \"Labor Committees,\" which allows for rank-and-file members to serve as part of a democratic process, allowing them to raise concerns about various issues, including pay, housing options, workplace environment, and benefits.\n\nThe unionization of political campaigns has been a challenging and unusual process for many years, but Sanders has been supportive of the effort and the campaign voluntarily recognized staffers' bargaining unit. Sanders tweeted in March, \"We can not just support unions with words, we must back it up with actions. On this campaign and when we are in the White House, we are going to make it easier for people to join unions, not harder.\"\n\nAs the negotiations continue, the internal strife within Sanders' campaign serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by workers in their pursuit of fair wages and better working conditions, even within the labor movement itself.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Criticizes Bill O'Reilly, Calls for Media Unity in Upcoming Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery interview on Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Tuesday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin took aim at her colleague Bill O'Reilly, criticizing him for not taking her potential presidential bid seriously and labeling him as part of the \"quasi- or assumed conservative\" elements in the media.\n\nDuring the interview, Palin dismissed the negative reaction to her speech at the King's summit over the weekend, and launched a familiar attack on the mainstream media, which she predicted would be a formidable force in the 2016 elections.\n\n\"Knowing what the media is going to do throughout 2016 \u2014 and my prediction, Hillary will be running and she will be, you know, the knighted candidate on the left and with the media \u2014 knowing what the media is going to do, it\u2019s going to take more than a village to beat Hillary,\" Palin told host Sean Hannity.\n\nPalin, who served half her single term as Alaska governor, flopped as Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential running mate, and has spent much of her post-political career backing unsuccessful Tea Party primary challengers, then outlined what a GOP victory next year would require.\n\n\"There needs to be unity, understanding,\" she said. \"Conservatives have that strike against us right off the bat, that being the media. Even there on Fox, you know, kind of a quasi- or assumed conservative outlet... and soon we have all day listening to the tease of Bill O\u2019 Reilly\u2019s,\" she added.\n\n\"He\u2019s talking about the guests on his show tonight, the commentary on his show, and that would be, \u2018All these GOP contenders thinking about running for president, like Donald Trump, Sarah Palin,\u2019 and he named some others \u2014 and he said, \u2018Oh, what a reality show that would be, yuck yuck,'\" Palin said. \"Well, the left doesn\u2019t do that, okay? They take this serious. Because this is war. And hopefully the media \u2014 even the quasi-right side of the media \u2014 won\u2019t be looking at this as some kind of reality show, a joke.\"\n\nPalin, who hosts shows on TLC and the Sportsman Channel, made it clear that she is not a reality show candidate.",
    " Title: Georgia's Sixth Congressional District Special Election: John Lewis Urges Voter Turnout as Ossoff and Handel Prepare for Runoff\n\nArticle:\n\nMARIETTA, Georgia \u2014 Civil rights icon and U.S. Representative John Lewis (D-GA) rallied volunteers for Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff at a campaign event on Saturday, emphasizing the importance of voting in the upcoming runoff election.\n\n\"The vote is precious and sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have,\" Lewis said. \"There are some in this country who still seek to deny some of us our right to vote. We can fight back by exercising that right.\"\n\nThe event, a get-out-the-vote rally, featured a festive atmosphere with pickup football, pulled-pork sandwiches, and a woman dancing in an inflatable dinosaur costume. However, Lewis' somber message cut through the festivities, underscoring the significance of the upcoming election.\n\nThe race between Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, Georgia's former secretary of state, is the most expensive House race in history and one of the most highly anticipated special elections of the year. The election will take place on Tuesday, with voters in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District choosing between the two candidates.\n\nPolling over the past three weeks suggests Ossoff has a narrow but potentially shrinking lead over Handel. Four out of five polls released in June show Ossoff with a lead between 7 points and 1 point, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average. However, one poll showed the race in a dead heat, and a poll at the beginning of May showed Handel leading by 2 points.\n\nMoreover, Ossoff's lead appears to have diminished slightly. While a poll released on June 8 had Ossoff up by 7 points, the most recent poll we have\u2014from Fox 5 Atlanta\u2014shows the Democrat's lead being cut to a single point.\n\nOssoff came in first in the first round of voting this April in Georgia's unusual \"jungle primary\" system, which featured more than a dozen other candidates. However, he didn't clear 50 percent of the vote in that race, setting up Tuesday's runoff election, in which Republicans will have consolidated behind Handel.\n\nSigns point to massive turnout in the race. More than half of the district's voters have been contacted in person by Ossoff's campaign, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The New York Times' Nate Cohn says that 40,000 people who didn't vote in the runoff this March have already cast a ballot this time around.\n\n\"It will all come down to turnout,\" Ossoff told his supporters at his rally. \"Let's make sure we get out there and vote.\"",
    " Title: White House Downgrades Jared Kushner's Security Clearance to Secret Level, Limiting Access to Sensitive Information\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that affects numerous high-level White House aides, Presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has had his security clearance downgraded to the Secret level. This decision, announced in a memo sent on Friday, will restrict Kushner's access to many of the sensitive documents he previously had unrestricted access to.\n\nThe memo, which was not signed by Chief of Staff John Kelly, was sent to all White House aides who were working on the highest-level interim clearances, known as Top Secret/SCI-level. Three individuals with knowledge of the situation confirmed this development. The SCI acronym stands for sensitive compartmented information, a category of information that comes from sensitive intelligence sources and must be kept confidential.\n\nThe memo's release comes in the wake of the scandal involving former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, which revealed that dozens of White House aides had yet to receive permanent clearances but still had access to some of the country's deepest secrets.\n\nPresident Trump has the ability to grant Kushner a permanent clearance, but on Friday, the same day the memo was sent, Trump stated that he would leave the decision to his Chief of Staff. \"I will let General Kelly make that decision,\" Trump told reporters. \"I have no doubt he'll make the right decision.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the memo. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to comment on Kushner's clearance status during a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nKushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, issued a statement saying, \"Mr. Kushner has done more than what is expected of him in this process. The changes will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president.\"\n\nFriday's decision marks the first change to the clearance process implemented in response to the Porter scandal that directly affects Kushner, who serves as a senior adviser to Trump and had access to the president's daily brief, the most highly classified document that Trump sees.\n\nBradley Moss, a lawyer who specializes in national security law and clearances, explained that Kushner and others will be debriefed by White House security officials, with the debriefing scheduled to take place on Thursday. \"They're going to give him a list, 'Here's what you've been debriefed from, you've been debriefed from this program and that compartment, you no longer have any access to it, and any breach of that would be a serious security violation and a possible criminal issue,'\" Moss said.\n\nChief of Staff John Kelly took the rare step last week of issuing a public statement that Kushner would be able to continue his work in the White House unfettered. However, it remains unclear whether Kushner will need access to top-secret information to continue performing his duties, and whether Kelly is prepared to enact a policy that could be perceived as a jab at the president's son-in-law.\n\nThe decision to downgrade White House staffers still working on interim clearances indicates that Kelly is prepared to impose the same sort of discipline on the White House clearance process that he has tried to impose on the West Wing staff more broadly. \"The American people deserve a White House staff that meets the highest standards and that has been carefully vetted\u2014especially those who work closely with the president or handle sensitive national security information,\" Kelly said in a memo circulated on Feb. 16.\n\nEarlier this month, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats stated in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that people with temporary security clearances should have limited access to sensitive classified information. Coats did not mention any specific individuals. \"Sometimes it is necessary to have some type of preliminary clearance in order to fill a slot, but... access has to be limited in terms of the kinds of information they can be in a position to receive or not receive,\" Coats said. \"It needs to be reformed.\"\n\nKushner has seen his once-expansive West Wing role steadily curtailed since Kelly's arrival last July. The new Chief immediately required Kushner and his wife, first daughter Ivanka Trump, to report through him rather than directly to the president. The pair have also seen their circle of trusted allies shrink in recent weeks. Reed Cordish, who joined the White House early on as part of Kushner's Office of American Innovation, left the White House earlier this month. Communications staffer Josh Raffel, who handles requests involving Kushner and Ivanka Trump, also plans to leave in the next two months, according to two people familiar with his decision. Raffel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The news of his departure was first reported by Axios.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Fails to Offer Policy Solutions for Public Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention, themed \"Make America Safe Again,\" failed to present any concrete policy ideas for enhancing public safety during its first night. The focus was on rhetoric rather than actionable strategies to combat crime and terrorism.\n\nWhile it is essential to acknowledge that America has generally become safer over the past few decades, there is still room for improvement in ensuring the nation's security. However, the lack of constructive dialogue from political figures leaves citizens concerned about the country's safety.\n\nTo make America safer, politicians must take tangible steps to address the issue. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has yet to demonstrate a clear understanding of how to achieve this goal. His first two speakers were C-list celebrities discussing the challenges of expressing open racism in today's society rather than offering solutions to improve public safety.\n\nThe rates of murder and violent crime in the United States began to decline in 1991 and continued to fall through 2014. There is some indication that crime may have risen in 2015, which, if true, would be a cause for concern.\n\nDespite the overall positive trends, the United States remains an outlier among wealthy countries in terms of its level of lethal violence. It is crucial to address this issue and aspire to the level of physical security enjoyed by residents of countries like Belgium, Greece, or Canada.\n\nSeveral policy ideas have been proposed to reduce crime, such as investing in preventative policing, public health measures, and reducing the number of concealable handguns in circulation. The trade-off between public safety and individual liberty is a complex issue, but it is clear that reducing the number of handguns would lead to fewer murders, albeit with an increase in non-fatal stabbing.\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Baton Rouge police officers, Donald Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, reportedly views this as part of a \"pattern of lawlessness\" in American cities that will bolster Trump's law and order campaign. Manafort has cited Richard Nixon's 1968 RNC acceptance speech as an inspiration for Trump's campaign.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the decrease in crime over the course of the 1960s was a result of a backlash against liberalism, and Richard Nixon's \"law and order\" campaign was successful in 1968. The increased focus on law enforcement during the Nixon-Reagan era did not significantly reduce the crime rate.\n\nIf Trump becomes president, his interest in criminal justice policy will likely remain focused on affective toughness, with little concern for policy issues. This approach may lead to a president who is confident that the worse things get, the better off he will be.\n\nIn conclusion, the Republican National Convention failed to offer any meaningful policy solutions for making America safer. It is crucial for political figures to present actionable strategies to address crime and terrorism, rather than relying on rhetoric and affective toughness.",
    " Title: \"Paul Ryan's Sagging Popularity: A Look at the Speaker's Struggling Approval Ratings\"\n\nArticle:\n\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan is facing a decline in his national image as he presides over a Congress that is struggling to pass legislation and is unpopular among voters. As the House returns from recess this week with a lengthy to-do list, the Wisconsin Republican is experiencing the worst polling numbers of his career.\n\nGallup's polling shows a shift from positive to negative ratings for the first time, while Pew's poll indicates a 29% approval rating and 54% disapproval. Quinnipiac's survey reveals that 28% of voters view Ryan favorably, while 52% view him unfavorably. These national polls were conducted following the House GOP's failure to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe speaker's declining popularity reflects broader forces at work in Donald Trump's presidency. Ryan is now less popular among GOP voters than Trump, but his standing among Democrats and independents has also suffered.\n\n\"He's becoming a more traditional partisan figure, and in today's polarized environment, it's hard to maintain high positives that way,\" said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup poll.\n\nPolls by Gallup and Quinnipiac suggest that most of Ryan's erosion has occurred outside his own party, among independents and Democrats. In the latest Gallup survey, the speaker's favorability among Democrats plunged from 39% last November to 14% this month. In a Quinnipiac poll taken March 30 to April 3, 76% of Democratic voters viewed Ryan unfavorably, up from 42% at the outset of his speakership in the fall of 2015. Over that same span, Ryan's standing with independents has shifted from positive to negative.\n\nIn his home state of Wisconsin, Ryan's standing actually improved this year with Republicans while declining with liberals, Democrats, independents, and moderates, based on a March poll by the Marquette University Law School.\n\nIt's not entirely clear how much the saga of the health care bill has fueled Ryan's rising negatives nationally. The bill itself was unpopular, and the party's failure to come together was an embarrassment to the speaker. Ryan's numbers were declining before the legislation failed\u2014and have continued to worsen since.\n\n\"He's the symbol of Congress,\" said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac Poll. \"Almost every time pollsters ask voters whether they have a favorable opinion of the president or Congress, Congress is a good deal worse than the president.\"\n\nCongress has an average job approval nationally of less than 20%. The recent polling points to a myriad of political challenges for Ryan. His leadership of a GOP-controlled House has helped drive his numbers down among Democrats. Congressional inaction and division have arguably hurt his numbers among independents.\n\nA failure to pass conservative bills on taxes and health care would undoubtedly damage his standing among Republican voters, which has already dipped a bit in some polls. Ryan is now less popular among voters overall than Trump, a reversal of the pattern of most of last year. And his national numbers are roughly as poor as those of other congressional leaders, including House Democratic Leader and former speaker Nancy Pelosi. That's another change from 2016.\n\nIn an interview with the Journal Sentinel on April 5, Ryan said he was \"unconcerned about popularity and polling.\"\n\n\"Leaders change polls, leaders don't follow polls. And we need to act like leaders, because we are leading now,\" Ryan said.\n\nRyan's decline matches one very familiar pattern. Modern House speakers often begin with positive ratings, but they rarely sustain them. Democrat Pelosi and Republicans John Boehner and Newt Gingrich each skidded into negative territory within their first year and largely remained there. A review of several years of polling by Gallup and Quinnipiac suggests that Ryan is yet to match the lowest lows that those three reached during their speakerships. But for the moment, he is headed in the same direction.",
    " Title: Obama Lifts U.S. Arms Embargo on Vietnam, Aims to Strengthen Ties and Boost Trade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move aimed at normalizing relations and boosting trade, President Barack Obama announced the full removal of the decades-long U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam on Monday. The decision, made in collaboration with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, is intended to eliminate a \"lingering vestige of the Cold War\" and foster deeper security cooperation.\n\nThe embargo, initially imposed in 1984, was partially lifted in 2014. However, Vietnam has been pushing for full access as it navigates China's land reclamation and military construction in nearby seas. The U.S. president stated that every U.S. arms sale will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis moving forward.\n\nWhile the move has been criticized for potentially diminishing U.S. leverage to press for human rights improvements in the one-party state, Vietnam currently holds about 100 political prisoners, and there have been more detentions this year. Phil Robertson, with Human Rights Watch, expressed concern, stating, \"In one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam -- and (has) basically gotten nothing for it.\"\n\nChina, which remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and European Union following the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, outwardly praised the move. China's Foreign Ministry expressed hope that \"normal and friendly\" relations between the U.S. and Vietnam would contribute to regional stability.\n\nObama and Quang also addressed maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The U.S. does not take sides on the territorial disputes but supports a diplomatic resolution based on \"international norms.\"\n\nLifting the arms embargo is expected to serve as a psychological boost for Vietnam's leaders as they counter an increasingly aggressive China. However, there may not be a significant increase in arms sales.\n\nObama was greeted by Quang at the Presidential Palace, where Obama congratulated Vietnam for making \"extraordinary progress.\" Quang praised the expansion in security and trade ties between \"former enemies turned friends\" and called for more U.S. investment in Vietnam.\n\nThe president also emphasized the need for stronger commercial and economic ties, including the approval of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which is currently stalled in Congress and facing opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates. The deal, which includes Vietnam, would eliminate trade barriers and encourage investment between the countries that signed it.\n\nCritics worry it would lead to job losses due to low-wage competition from countries such as Vietnam. Obama and Quang also attended a signing ceremony for a series of new commercial deals between U.S. and Vietnamese companies valued at over $16 billion. The deals included U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney's plans to sell 135 advanced engines to Vietnamese air carrier Vietjet, and Boeing's plans to sell 100 aircraft to the airline.\n\nObama is the third sitting president to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Four decades after the fall of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation, Obama is eager to upgrade relations with an emerging power whose rapidly expanding middle class presents a promising market for U.S. goods and a counterbalance to China's growing strength. The U.S. is eager to boost trade with a fast-growing middle class in Vietnam that is expected to double by 2020. This would involve lowering auto, food, and machine tariffs to increase U.S. product access in Vietnam.",
    " Title: Impact of Potential Government Shutdown on Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are bracing for significant disruptions. According to department officials, approximately 80 percent of FEMA's staff would be furloughed, with those called back in an emergency described as \"not optimal.\"\n\nThe shutdown would impede the operation of FEMA's E-Verify program, a system that enables employers to verify the legal status of newly hired workers. Most employees at law enforcement training centers would also be placed on leave.\n\nChip Fulghum, an acting deputy under secretary for management and the chief financial officer at DHS, expressed concerns about the impact of a shutdown, stating, \"Bills piled up, contractors were sent home, vendor invoices didn't get paid, hiring stopped, and pending contracts didn't go through.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding a potential shutdown, including its duration, can also have detrimental effects. Noah Kroloff, a former chief of staff at the department who is now a partner at a security consulting and business advisory firm, noted, \"Shutdowns are very taxing in general on the agency, because all the staff that's considered nonessential isn't necessarily there for the purpose of supporting the essential staff, and that has a really disproportionate impact on the essential staff just doing their day-to-day operations.\"\n\nHowever, Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the department responsible for implementing President Obama's executive actions, would largely remain unaffected due to its funding through application fees. Following a recent ruling by a Federal District Court in Texas, the Obama administration has indefinitely postponed the president's executive actions on immigration to comply with the court's decision, which it is now appealing.",
    " Title: White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon Exits, Marking Significant Shift in Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon has announced his departure from the Trump Administration, marking another significant change in the West Wing that has been marred by infighting and leaks. This move comes under the watch of new Chief of Staff John Kelly, who is reportedly given broad authority to streamline the White House staff.\n\nIn a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Bannon's departure, expressing gratitude for his service and wishing him well. President Trump, who has already dismissed two other key aides this year, had been under pressure from high-level Republican donors and activists to retain Bannon.\n\nBannon, the former head of Breitbart News, was instrumental in translating Trump's campaign message into policy and was seen as a strong advocate for the president's populist agenda. His departure is considered a significant change, given his close association with Trump's election victory.\n\nThe decision to part ways with Bannon came as a surprise to his allies within and outside the White House, who believed Trump would stand by his loyal strategist. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows had reportedly urged Trump not to fire Bannon, arguing that he was beneficial to conservatives' agenda.\n\nBannon's departure may have been influenced by his strained relationships with several senior aides, including Jared Kushner, Gary Cohn, and H.R. McMaster. Their disagreements often spilled into the press, contributing to the internal tensions within the White House.\n\nBannon's departure could potentially provoke a backlash among Trump's core supporters, who view him as a conduit to the president's base. His absence could also signal a shift in the administration's approach to issues, particularly those related to race and nationalism, given Bannon's prominent role in stoking cultural debates.\n\nWith the departure of Bannon, the White House staff is undergoing a significant reshuffle, with John Kelly at the helm, aiming to maintain a tight-knit and drama-free environment. The future direction of the Trump Administration remains to be seen, as this latest development marks a significant turning point in the White House's inner workings.",
    " Title: Bill Maher Criticizes Democratic Party for Fox News Debate Snub\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery critique during his Friday night show, HBO host Bill Maher lambasted the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) decision to exclude Fox News from hosting a 2020 presidential debate. DNC Chairman Tom Perez had stated that Fox News was not capable of hosting a fair and neutral debate for the candidates.\n\nMaher questioned the Democrats' decision, stating, \"Last week, the Democrats made a terrible decision when they announced that they had turned down Fox News's offer to host one of their 2020 primary debates, saying that Fox was nothing more than propaganda.\"\n\nMaher compared the Democrats' decision to a sports team refusing to play an away game, stating, \"You want to be in the big leagues, but you refuse to ever play an away game? You don\u2019t like the questions that Fox News might ask, so you\u2019re deciding not to take any questions at all? How very Trump of you.\"\n\nMaher argued that Republicans are not afraid to appear on his show, despite knowing that the audience is largely against them. He suggested that the Democrats should view such appearances as an opportunity to present their side of the story.\n\nFox News's Ed Henry and co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy applauded Maher for his comments, with Henry responding, \"How much truth he\u2019s speaking to his own party about the resistance movement being a bunch of wimps\u2014not actually getting in and fighting on ideas, for example, just taking cheap shots.\"\n\nCampos-Duffy added, \"It's not just on [Maher's] show that Republicans are willing to go on. Most of the media is very liberal, and conservative Republican members of Congress are very accustomed to going on to CNN and MSNBC and ABC and taking tough questions.\"\n\nMaher's comments echoed the sentiment that if the Democrats claim to be the \"resistance,\" they should be fearless and willing to answer tough questions. He argued that if the candidates are too afraid to answer questions they don't like while running for president, they won't be able to handle the weight of answering tough questions while in office.\n\nConservatives, according to Maher, are forced to continually engage with liberal news anchors and reporters because the majority of news outlets are liberal. If conservatives refused to talk to liberal outlets, they would be labeled as \"cowards\" who are hiding from tough questions.\n\nMaher's criticism of the Democrats' decision to exclude Fox News from the debate highlights a growing divide between the party and conservative media outlets, and raises questions about the Democrats' willingness to engage with a diverse range of viewpoints.",
    " Title: CDC Assures Public: Ebola Transmission on Flights Unlikely; Dallas Patient's Case Under Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a man is being treated for Ebola in a Dallas hospital after showing symptoms several days following his arrival from Liberia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that Ebola can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actively sick with the virus, and not through airborne transmission or before symptoms appear.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden stated that all passengers boarding from Ebola hotspots are screened for fever, and if they have a fever, they are not allowed to fly unless Ebola is ruled out. Stephan Monroe of the CDC further clarified that it is \"very unlikely\" for Ebola victims to spread the disease to fellow passengers.\n\nThe unidentified patient, who is being treated at a Dallas hospital, did not show symptoms until several days after he arrived in the United States. Officials are tight-lipped about how he contracted the virus or his treatment, citing privacy concerns.\n\nThe patient's fellow passengers are not thought to be at risk due to the nature of Ebola transmission. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) stated that it is highly unlikely for someone suffering Ebola's ghastly symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, fever, and unexplained bleeding, to feel well enough to travel.\n\nThe United States is not planning on banning flights coming from the hot zones in West Africa, but once flights land at a U.S. airport from one of those countries, passengers are screened again. If an individual is detected exhibiting symptoms, they can be quarantined and promptly evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nThe CDC is also working with airport officials in the affected countries and in Nigeria to screen passengers for fever before they board flights to the United States. The CDC team is currently investigating the people who came in contact with the man in Texas, and they will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop symptoms. If they do, they will be isolated.\n\nAlthough there is no vaccine and no cure for Ebola, the one real advantage we have with Ebola is that doctors know how to control it. The U.S. has the luxury of better health care compared to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, and the country has facilities that can \"do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the African countries that we are talking about,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe CDC and health officials are working diligently to contain the spread of Ebola in the United States and reassure the public that the risk of transmission is low. The CDC has issued warnings to avoid nonessential travel to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the countries hit the hardest by the outbreak. The public is encouraged to stay informed and follow the CDC's guidelines for travel and personal protection.",
    " Title: Trade Deficits and Surpluses: A Misunderstood Economic Concept\n\nArticle:\n\nThe term 'trade deficit' has been a subject of much debate and confusion, often misconstrued as a sign of economic trouble. However, this is not always the case, as a trade deficit is not a debt that has to be paid, but rather a bookkeeping entry. A trade deficit is simply a situation where a country imports more goods and services than it exports.\n\nContrary to popular belief, trade deficits are not primarily caused by tariffs or other protectionist policies. In fact, the United States and the European Union, on average, have almost identical tariff rates, with the U.S. at 1.7% and the EU at 2.0%, according to World Bank data. The U.S.-EU average tariffs have been significantly reduced since the early 1990s.\n\nChina, a country often associated with trade deficits, has reduced its average tariff by nearly 90% since the 1990s, from 32.2% to 3.5%. This period has seen China's economy thrive, debunking the notion that high tariffs are detrimental to economic growth.\n\nTrade deficits are not driven mainly by consumer behavior either. While it is true that many Americans prefer German cars and French wines, trade deficits are primarily the result of macroeconomic factors such as tax policies, savings rates, the strength of a country's currency, and its attractiveness to investors.\n\nTrade deficits are not a sign of economic trouble, and trade surpluses are not necessarily a sign of economic health. For instance, the last time the U.S. ran a trade surplus with the world was 1975, a time when the U.S. economy was in a shambles. Conversely, Britain ran a trade deficit from Waterloo to the Great War, a century marking the height of its power.\n\nWhen a country, like Germany, runs a trade surplus with another, it means it has excess funds. These funds can be used to buy dollar-denominated assets, invest in the surplus country, or even invest in the country with the deficit, as the Germans have done with their automobile factories in the U.S. This investment not only creates jobs but also contributes to the surplus country's economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding trade deficits and surpluses requires a nuanced approach, taking into account macroeconomic factors, consumer behavior, and the role of investments. Policies aimed at addressing trade deficits should be based on a comprehensive understanding of these factors to ensure they contribute positively to the economy.",
    " Title: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Temporary Restraining Order on Trump's Travel Ban, Emphasizes Due Process Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has refused to overturn the temporary restraining order (TRO) against President Trump's travel ban. The court's decision, which has received relatively little attention in media coverage, emphasizes an argument that has not been widely discussed: the due process rights of individuals affected by the executive order.\n\nWashington and Minnesota, the states that brought the lawsuit resulting in the TRO, argue that many of the people covered by the ban have a right to due process that the government has not respected. The 9th Circuit believes the states have a good chance of proving this claim, stating that \"the Government has not demonstrated that the States lack viable claims based on the due process rights of persons who will suffer injuries to protected interests due to the Executive Order.\"\n\nThe travel ban, which temporarily suspends the admission of refugees for 120 days and imposes a 90-day ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, has sparked much debate. The states' argument that the order impermissibly discriminates against Muslims is one such point of contention. The 9th Circuit, however, devotes more attention to the due process argument.\n\nThe court notes that the ability to re-enter the country after traveling abroad, or to travel in anticipation of that ability, is a \"liberty interest\" protected by the Fifth Amendment. However, the court states that the executive order does not provide what due process requires, such as notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel.\n\nThe court also questions the Trump administration's assertion that the order never applied to lawful permanent residents. The administration initially stated that the ban applied to lawful permanent residents, then issued a blanket waiver stating their entry is \"in the national interest.\" The administration's latest position, laid out in a February 1 memo from White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II, is that the order never applied to lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe 9th Circuit rejected this assurance, stating that McGahn's authority to revise the president's order or require government officials to adhere to his interpretation is questionable. The court also noted that in light of the government's shifting interpretations of the order, it cannot guarantee that the current interpretation will persist.\n\nThe court also highlights that green-card holders are not the only individuals affected by the order with potential due process claims. These claims also extend to non-immigrant visa holders who have been in the United States but temporarily departed or wish to temporarily depart, and applicants who have a relationship with a U.S. resident or institution that might have rights of its own to assert.\n\nThe court states that the government has not provided an affirmative argument showing that the states' procedural due process claims fail for these categories of aliens. For example, the government has failed to establish that lawful permanent residents have no due process rights when seeking to re-enter the United States.\n\nAssuming some people affected by the order have a right to due process, it is not clear what it would entail. The only potential relief provided by the order comes from discretionary, case-by-case waivers \"in the national interest.\" The court suggests that due process would at least require \"notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel,\" and presumably, the hearing would do more than verify that the individual comes from one of the banned countries.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the appeals court, if it was not prepared to block the TRO entirely, to narrow its scope to cover only \"previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\" The court notes that this category would include many of the people with potential due process claims, but not all of them, since it omits \"aliens who are in the United States unlawfully,\" who \"have due process rights as well,\" and \"citizens who have an interest in specific non-citizens' ability to travel to the United States.\"\n\nRather than seek a narrower TRO, Trump could rewrite his order to focus on unvetted foreign nationals who have never visited the U.S., which would address most of the due process concerns while bolstering the credibility of his claim that he is trying to protect Americans from terrorists. \"Even if the TRO might be overbroad in some respects,\" the court says, \"it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order. The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions.\"",
    " Title: The Resurgence of Childish Behavior in American Politics: A Look at the Liberal Elite's Response to Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the 2016 presidential election marked a significant shift in the dynamics of discourse and behavior. One of the recurring themes in the media's criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump was his supposed lack of \"temperament\" and \"maturity.\" This charge, often leveled by some of the most contentious journalists, is a testament to the irony inherent in liberal criticism, as they often demand \"civility\" from their opponents while exhibiting a wide array of uncivil behaviors themselves.\n\nThe liberal approach to civility is not rooted in any principle independent of human will but rather in political opportunism. When in power, they advocate for decorum to maintain control, but when out of power, they discard these principles in pursuit of regaining power. The \"ends\" become the justification for the means, and any opposition to their uncivil behavior is met with accusations of failing to see the \"higher\" good at stake.\n\nSince Trump's victory, instances of uncivil behavior have proliferated, particularly among upper-class liberals. Central Park plays hosting simulated Trump assassinations, Kathy Griffin's mock-beheading of Trump, and calls for Trump's son to be placed in a \"cage with pedophiles\" are just a few examples. Liberal activists have also been seen cheering attempts to disrupt Ivanka Trump's travel and congratulating restaurants for refusing service to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, with some even suggesting poisoning her.\n\nIn the Bush years, liberals resorted to throwing cakes at reviled conservatives. Now, they eject conservatives from restaurants before dessert, while simultaneously demanding that Christians create cakes for gay weddings. The hypocrisy is palpable, with supposedly \"serious\" liberal publications joining in the fray.\n\nRecently, a piece in Politico detailed the troubling lack of neatness and inclusiveness of Trump aide Stephen Miller during his third-grade year in Santa Monica. The author, John F. Muller, a former lecturer at Harvard Law School, recounted Miller's alleged obsession with tape and glue, as well as his meticulous demarcation of his desk space. The author interpreted Miller's behavior as a manifestation of a narcissistic wall-building instinct, a precursor to his current political stance on immigration.\n\nThis incident, among others, underscores the childishness that persists within the liberal elite, a childishness that resurfaces once they are stripped of power. They have transitioned from raging against Trump's lack of \"temperament\" to throwing a temper tantrum worthy of a third-grader. As the political landscape continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how this childishness will manifest in the future.",
    " Title: \"Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden: A Test of the 'Believe All Women' Movement\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing discourse surrounding sexual misconduct allegations, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, has consistently advocated for the \"believe all women\" approach. However, this stance is now being put to the test as he faces a serious sexual assault allegation from a former staffer, Tara Reade.\n\nDuring an interview with journalist Katie Halper, Reade, a self-proclaimed \"California-based victim rights advocate and activist,\" alleged that Biden assaulted her in 1993, while she was working for him in the early 1990s. According to Reade, Biden kissed her without her consent, pushed her against a wall, reached under her skirt, and digitally penetrated her.\n\nReade had previously complained about sexual harassment in Biden's office, but this is the first time she has shared such a serious allegation. She said she once tried to discuss the incident with a supervisor, but was shut down before she could tell her story in its entirety. Reade also claimed to have filled out an official form detailing the assault, but is unsure of its current whereabouts.\n\nThe mainstream media has given Reade's story limited attention, with major outlets like The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN yet to cover the story. However, the anti-Biden left has seized the opportunity, with #IBelieveTaraReade trending on Twitter. Critics, such as Nathan Robinson, editor of the leftist publication Current Affairs, have called out MSNBC and CNN for failing to cover the story.\n\nThe timing of the allegation, so close to the primary elections, has led to speculation and debate among supporters of both Biden and his rivals. While some see it as a last-minute attempt to derail Biden's campaign, others view it as a long-overdue revelation that deserves attention, given the \"believe all women\" stance Biden has taken.\n\nThe Reade allegation, if substantiated, could potentially impact Biden's campaign, but it remains to be seen how the mainstream media and the Democratic primary voters will respond. The response will provide insight into the true meaning of the \"believe all women\" movement and whether it applies to allegations made decades ago, as in the case of Reade, or only to more recent accusations.",
    " Title: Obama's Struggle with Government Inefficiency: A Look at the VA Scandal and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early days of his presidency, President Barack Obama expressed a vision for a \"smarter and better\" government, promising to deliver on key issues such as health care reform. However, recent events, including the VA scandal and the troubled rollout of the health care website, have led to a series of bureaucratic messes that have cast a shadow over the Obama administration's ability to manage the government effectively.\n\nCNN's Gloria Borger compares President Obama's current situation to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice Through the Looking Glass,\" suggesting that the President is \"staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency.\" The VA scandal, in particular, highlights the problem, as it raises questions about the administration's ability to manage a critical government agency and fulfill its commitment to veterans.\n\nThe President's approach to managing the government seems to have two extremes: issues that are micromanaged, such as foreign policy, and issues that are delegated, such as VA management. What appears to be missing is a middle ground: continual monitoring and early warning systems that avoid presidential blindsiding. This is the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done.\n\nThe VA scandal is not an isolated incident. The disastrous health care website rollout, the IRS controversy, and the question of NSA surveillance all raise questions about the role of government and the President's ability to manage it effectively. These are not trivial matters, as health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration, and a botched rollout has tarnished its reputation. The VA scandal, with its allegations of staffers fudging numbers and potential criminal charges, further underscores the need for effective management.\n\nThe President's governing style seems to be a challenge when it comes to managing people with mixed motives, such as Congress. Obama is known for his ability to lead a hierarchical organization with a single goal, but managing or negotiating with people with differing viewpoints is not a strong point.\n\nBorger suggests that the President needs to take control of the bureaucracy and make government work for the American people, as he had promised. The government apparatus to do the nation's business in a competent way is there, but it needs to be used and managed effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the VA scandal and other bureaucratic messes have raised questions about the Obama administration's ability to manage the government effectively. The President's governing style seems to be a challenge when it comes to managing people with mixed motives, and the current situation has led some to question whether the President still feels government can work for the American people.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Makes First Post-2008 Presidential Campaign Visit to Iowa, Sparks 2016 Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political move, former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first visit to Iowa since her 2008 presidential campaign on Sunday, attending the 37th annual steak fry hosted by retiring Senator Tom Harkin. The visit, which took place in Indianola, has sparked renewed speculation about Clinton's political future.\n\nClinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, joined Harkin to celebrate the Iowa lawmaker's 40-year political career. Throughout the event, Clinton engaged with supporters, signed autographs, and even flipped steaks, while avoiding questions about a potential 2016 presidential bid.\n\nWhen asked about her plans, Clinton playfully hinted at her future endeavors, stating, \"I am thinking about it, but for today that is not why I am here.\" This comment was met with disappointed \"aahs\" from the crowd, as Clinton emphasized, \"I am here for the steak.\"\n\nClinton praised Harkin's political career and urged the 5,000 activists in attendance to honor Harkin's legacy by working hard for Democrats in the November election, including Harkin's protege, U.S. Rep. Bruce L. Braley, who is running for Harkin's seat against state Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican.\n\nClinton emphasized the importance of the upcoming Iowa election, stating, \"In 50 days, every Iowa voter needs to know that from the president on down to local officials, we Democrats are for raising the minimum wage, for equal pay for equal work, for making college and technical training affordable, for growing the economy to benefit everyone \u2014 and our opponents are not.\"\n\nThe race in Iowa is one of several crucial contests that could determine whether Democrats maintain control of the Senate during the final two years of the Obama administration. Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to flip control of the upper chamber.\n\nAccording to a CNN/ORC poll released Friday, Mr. Braley has a slight 49 percent to 48 percent lead over Mrs. Ernst among likely voters. The survey also found that 53 percent of registered Democrats said they would support Clinton in the Iowa caucuses, which traditionally kick off the nomination race.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Iowa on Wednesday, and other potential Democratic candidates, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, also received significant support in the poll.\n\nSenator Sanders, who was in Iowa over the weekend and is openly considering a bid, stated on ABC's \"This Week\" that Americans do not want a \"crowning\" of a presidential nominee but rather a \"debate about the important issues facing American families.\"\n\nBefore the steak fry, the Clintons attended a private reception for Harkin's To Organize a Majority PAC at Principal Park, the home of Des Moines' minor league baseball team. When asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" whether he would support Clinton for president, Harkin was noncommittal, stating they are \"very close friends\" and that Clinton has inspired women across the globe.\n\nIn 2008, Clinton placed a disappointing third behind then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee. In her memoir \"Hard Choices,\" Clinton described the Iowa result as \"excruciating.\" At the steak fry on Sunday, Harkin suggested Clinton could rebound from the experience, calling the Clintons the \"comeback couple.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Declares ISIS Committing Genocide Against Christians in Iraq and Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria. This determination, set to be announced on Thursday, follows a unanimous vote by the U.S. House of Representatives last week declaring the actions of ISIS against Christians a genocide.\n\nKerry's finding is in line with the conclusions of various governments, legislative bodies, non-governmental organizations, and world leaders, who have also been calling for the official declaration. The available evidence demonstrates that ISIS' actions rise to the level of genocide, according to legal organizations representing persecuted Christians in the Middle East.\n\nThe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed by the U.S. and 147 other nations, declares genocide a crime under international law. The treaty states that countries need to work together \"to liberate mankind from this odious scourge.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Kerry's finding does not obligate the United States to take additional action against ISIS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members. The U.S. will work to provide evidence of the atrocities committed by ISIS.\n\nThe declaration comes as ISIS has subjected Assyrian and other Iraqi and Syrian Christians living in areas under its control to genocidal conditions. ISIS purportedly offers the Assyrian Christians three options: convert to Islam, assume dhimmi status and pay an associated jizya tax, or leave the territory. In reality, there is no choice, and those who refuse or are otherwise unable to comply are executed, or in many instances, the option of paying the jizya tax is not made available.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus also submitted a nearly 300-page report to Kerry and the State Department last week, laying out a detailed case for the genocide declaration. The report states, \"ISIS is committing genocide \u2014 the 'crime of crimes' \u2014 against Christians and other religious groups in Syria, Iraq, and Libya.\"\n\nThe decline in the number of Christians living in Iraq and Syria over the past decade is stark. In 2003, there were nearly two million Christians living in the region. Today, there are just 250,000. The U.S. will continue to work with its allies to address this issue and hold ISIS accountable for its actions.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Impose Reciprocal Personnel Caps on State-Run Media Organizations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that may escalate tensions between the United States and China, the Trump administration has imposed a cap on the number of Chinese citizens permitted to work for China's major state-run media companies in the U.S. This decision comes weeks after China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, a move that sparked fury from White House officials.\n\nThe State Department cap will cut the number of Chinese nationals working for the state-run media companies in the United States to 100 employees, down from 160. The move marks the first time since the era of Mao Zedong that China has expelled multiple journalists from one international news organization simultaneously, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe cap extends to five Chinese media entities: Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corporation, and Hai Tian Development USA. Last month, the Chinese outlets were designated as foreign missions by the White House, meaning that none of the outlets will be regarded as an independent news organization in the country.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the cap in a tweet on Monday, stating, \"Today, we announced a personnel cap on Chinese government-controlled media organizations in the United States. We urge Beijing to respect freedom of expression and will continue to seek reciprocity across the bilateral relationship.\"\n\nPompeo further explained, \"Our goal is reciprocity. As we have done in other areas of the U.S.-China relationship, we seek to establish a long-overdue level playing field. It is our hope that this action will spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China.\"\n\nThe move comes as the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues to spread globally, adding another layer of complexity to the already strained relationship between the two nations. China seemed unhappy with the move, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson who questioned the validity of the White House's goal of \"reciprocity.\"\n\n\"Now the US kicked off the game, let's play,\" she wrote on Twitter early Tuesday. The exact impact of this decision on the U.S.-China relationship remains to be seen, but it is clear that both nations are taking steps to assert their respective positions in the global arena.",
    " Title: Facebook Restores Senator Warren's Ads After Removal Over Big Tech Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, Facebook has reinstated several ads placed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, following their removal earlier this week. The social media giant initially pulled four of Warren's ads due to a violation of its policy against the misuse of Facebook's logo.\n\nWarren, on March 8, unveiled a plan to curtail growing monopolies owned by tech giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. She argues that these companies stifle innovation and harm small businesses.\n\nFacebook, in a statement to media outlets, confirmed that it had pulled four of Warren's ads on Monday due to the use of the letter \"f\" in a video that appeared in the ads, which the company deemed a misuse of its logo. However, the ads were reinstated shortly thereafter, with Facebook stating, \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.\"\n\nThe majority of Warren's ads, nine others placed on Facebook, were not affected by the removal. In response to the initial removal, Warren tweeted, \"Curious why I think Facebook has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether Facebook has too much power.\"\n\nWarren's plan, titled \"Here's How We Can Break Up Big Tech,\" includes reining in Amazon, Google, and Facebook by supporting regulators in breaking up \"anti-competitive\" mergers such as Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.\n\nThis incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the power and influence of tech giants in today's digital age. Warren's plan, if implemented, could significantly reshape the tech industry and the way these companies operate.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda Claims Responsibility for Charlie Hebdo Attacks, Yemen-Based Commander Takes Credit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling development, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week. The claim was made in an 11-minute Internet video posted Wednesday by Nasr al-Ansi, a top commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).\n\nIn the video, al-Ansi, who is also known as the \"prince of Al Qaeda,\" stated that the massacre was in \"vengeance for the prophet.\" He also warned France of more \"tragedies and terror,\" and claimed that Yemen's Al Qaeda branch \"chose the target, laid out the plan, and financed the operation,\" though he provided no evidence to support the claim.\n\nIt was previously reported that one of the brothers who carried out the attack, Sa\u00efd Kouachi, had received training in Yemen. The revelation comes just a few short months after President Obama touted anti-terrorism operations in Yemen and Somalia as a success and upheld them as examples of how the United States would fight ISIS.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly argued that Al Qaeda is \"on the run\" and that its core leaders have been \"decimated.\" However, the latest developments in Yemen may challenge this narrative. In a speech at the White House on September 10, 2014, Obama stated that the counterterrorism campaign against ISIS would be waged through a \"steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground.\"\n\nRaw video footage shows the Kouachi brothers yelling about vengeance for the prophet Mohammed just after they murdered Charlie Hebdo editors and left the scene. The White House has been criticized for avoiding using the term \"Islamic terror\" to describe the attack.\n\nThe public is invited to share their opinions on how the White House should respond to ISIS through a poll on the news outlet's website.",
    " Title: The First Amendment and Flag Burning: A Constitutional Perspective on President-elect Trump's Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, a contentious issue has resurfaced: the constitutionality of flag burning. Nearly all elected officials, from the president down to local city councilors, have expressed a desire to criminalize flag desecration. However, the U.S. Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, forbids such action due to the protection of freedom of expression.\n\nThe late Justice William J. Brennan once stated that while he would not condone flag burning, he would not advocate for its criminalization. This sentiment is shared by many, including the author, who believes that while flag burners may be despised, their actions should not be criminalized.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of expression. Furthermore, the court has also ruled that citizenship cannot be revoked based on a criminal conviction, including for flag burning. President-elect Trump's proposal to take away the citizenship of flag burners is, therefore, unconstitutional.\n\nAs president, Trump may have the power to change the constitutional status of flag burning by appointing justices who agree with the minority in the most recent 5-4 flag burning decision. However, such a change could have serious consequences, as it would open a slippery slope for denying other basic freedoms of expression.\n\nCandidate Trump has advocated for changing the libel laws to make it easier to sue his critics. However, any such change may boomerang against Trump himself, who has been known to use defamation as a political weapon. Being president does not immunize the incumbent from being sued for mouthing off against opponents.\n\nThe First Amendment has served the U.S. well for over two centuries, protecting extremists on both the right and left. The author urges President-elect Trump to withdraw his stance on flag burning, develop a thicker skin for criticism, and stop tinkering with the freedom of expression.\n\nThe First Amendment is a principle that liberals and conservatives alike can and should support. Historically, it has always been opposed by extremists on both the right and the left, who have no patience for dissenting points of view. The author concludes by urging Trump to respect the First Amendment and the principles it embodies.",
    " Title: Twitter's Stand Against Government Demand for User Identity Reinforces First Amendment Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) division requested Twitter to reveal the identity of a user who has been critical of the Trump administration. However, the agency quickly retracted the demand, acknowledging it had no authority to issue such a request. This incident has sparked concerns among critics of the Trump administration, reinforcing fears of neo-fascist tendencies.\n\nTwitter's primary objection, the company stated, is that allowing the government to unmask Twitter critics violates the Constitution's First Amendment right to free speech. The company argued that this right is particularly important when discussing political speech. In a court filing, Twitter said, \"First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.\"\n\nTwitter expressed concern that the demand \"may reflect the very sort of official retaliation that can result from speech that criticizes government officials and agencies.\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) labeled the CBP demand a \"witch hunt.\" In a letter to CPB, he expressed \"grave alarm\" over an apparent attempt to \"squelch the exercise of First Amendment rights to comment on U.S. policy, and to make those comments anonymously.\"\n\nEsha Bhandari, a staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that the case was \"about the broader right to speak anonymously on the internet.\" She told The Washington Post, \"Speaking anonymously about issues of the day is a longstanding American tradition, dating back to when the framers of the Constitution wrote under pseudonyms. The anonymity that the First Amendment guarantees is often most essential when people criticize the government, and this free speech right is as important today as ever.\"\n\nAlex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, praised Twitter's rebuff of the CBP demand, stating, \"The choices they made to stand up for their users set important precedents for other companies now and into the future.\"\n\nThe debate over anonymous speech online is not new, and it often intersects with the issue of \"dark money\" in political campaigns. Dark money consists of donations to politically oriented nonprofit groups that can use the money for independent expenditures urging the public to vote for or against a political candidate. Dark-money expenditures have increased in recent years, but they still represent only a tiny fraction of total campaign spending.\n\nDespite the relatively small amount of dark money in political campaigns, the term \"dark money\" has a negative connotation, evoking images of nefarious activities. As a result, calls for disclosure have arisen, with legislation being introduced in Congress and in more than half the states that would require incorporated nonprofits to disclose their donors.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, for instance, is proud to have sponsored legislation that \"would require all entities that engage in election-related activity to report their significant donors.\" The Sunlight Foundation, which supports the DISCLOSE Act, argues that it would require \"secretive nonprofits\" to reveal the names of significant donors, unless those donors specify that their money cannot be used for political purposes.\n\nHowever, the ACLU has criticized dark-money disclosure laws, particularly those like the one in New York, as overly broad measures that \"could chill constitutionally protected speech.\" Campaign-finance reformers often claim their concern is with money, not political speech. However, it is impossible to separate the two. When a group like NARAL Pro-Choice America blasts a Republican for his stance on abortion rights, it spends money to do so. The money is not speech, but it makes the speech possible, and limiting the expenditure would limit the speech as well.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United, which allowed a non-profit corporation to publish criticism of a politician in the weeks leading up to an election, highlights this issue. Twitter is a for-profit corporation that recently published criticism of a politician by the name of Donald Trump. Let's hope those who were horrified by the administration's demand that the user be unmasked think long and hard about whether they want the government unmasking other critics, too.",
    " Title: George H.W. Bush's Faith and Spirituality: A Personal Journey\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, was known for his quiet faith, a private aspect of his life that he acknowledged as crucial for anyone leading the nation. In a 1992 interview with Pat Robertson, Bush expressed his belief that an atheist could not be president, emphasizing the importance of faith in guiding a leader.\n\nDuring the interview, Bush spoke about his regular prayers, sharing that he and his wife, Barbara, would pray at meals and before bed. He agreed with Robertson about the need for faith in the Oval Office, stating, \"The more I was there, the more I understood what Lincoln meant, the more I understood the need to have some lift, some strength greater than yourself.\"\n\nIn 1990, before ordering the start of Operation Desert Shield in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush found solace in prayer. He noted the gravity of the decision, stating, \"The decision rests only with the president for that\u2014only the president\u2014and there was certainly time and need for prayer on that.\"\n\nIn 2007, during a dedication ceremony for the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bush spoke about his spirituality, stating, \"I've always viewed my faith as a personal matter, an intensely personal matter... There's nothing self-conscious, however, about my relationship with Jesus Christ.\"\n\nBush's casket currently lies in the Capitol rotunda, allowing the public to pay their respects. On Wednesday, President Trump and the first lady will attend an invitation-only state funeral for Bush at the National Cathedral. Afterwards, the casket will be flown back to Houston for a service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Thursday, followed by a private ceremony and burial at the Bush presidential library on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station. Bush will be buried alongside his wife Barbara, who died in April, and their daughter Robin Bush, who died of leukemia in 1953 at age 3.",
    " Title: Romney Hesitates to Comment on Obama's Decision to Halt Deportation of Young Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declined to comment on whether he would maintain President Obama's decision to halt the deportation of young adult illegal immigrants. The move, announced last week, has sparked controversy and debate, with some Republicans in Congress vowing to challenge the decision in court.\n\nThe White House, which had previously maintained that it lacked the authority to halt deportations, now claims it is on solid legal ground. White House political strategist David Plouffe stated on ABC's \"This Week\" program that the move is in line with the progression the Obama administration has made over the past three years to expand its claims of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that illegal immigrants under the age of 30 who were brought to the country before the age of 16, have been in the U.S. for at least five years, and have completed high school, earned an equivalency diploma, or joined the U.S. military would no longer be deported. The move does not grant the illegal immigrants permanent legal status but does end their risk of deportation and may provide them with legal work rights.\n\nAfter taking a hard-line stance on immigration during the primary, Romney said he would pursue a broader immigration solution but refused to say whether he would maintain the non-deportation policy in the meantime. Romney also accused Obama of politicizing the issue, stating that if he truly wanted to address the issue, he would have done so earlier in his presidency.\n\nThe administration's decision has been met with praise from immigrant-rights groups, who have long advocated for such a policy. However, some Republicans have criticized the move as an overreach of executive power, and a court challenge is a possibility. The administration maintains that it is not enacting the Dream Act, as it cannot grant full legal status, but rather is exercising prosecutorial discretion in a strong and sensible manner.\n\nThe Dream Act, which would grant a path to citizenship to most illegal immigrants under 30, has failed several times in Congress. However, Democrats have reintroduced a version, and several Republicans are working on their own legislation. Some Republicans, such as Rep. David Rivera and Sen. Marco Rubio, are also working on their own versions of the Dream Act.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Strategic Approach to Immigration Reform: A Comprehensive Review\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move to address the contentious issue of immigration reform, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has been actively engaging with grass-roots Republican voters and conservative media outlets. This approach, initiated after the 2012 presidential election's rejection of Mitt Romney by Hispanic voters, aims to redefine the immigration narrative from a conservative perspective.\n\nPhil Musser, a Republican consultant and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, commends Rubio's efforts, stating, \"The argument is that it's not conservative policy to have 11 million illegal immigrants in this country.\" Rubio's strategy involves open dialogue and a clear articulation of his immigration principles, earning praise from conservative icons such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.\n\nRubio and his team have learned from the mistakes of the 2007 immigration overhaul attempt. They emphasize the importance of meeting strict goals for border security before any path to citizenship can be established for illegal immigrants. The focus is also on refining the current system, with an emphasis on increased enforcement and a workable plan for future legal immigrants, to prevent another wave of illegal immigration.\n\nMel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida who was part of the 2007 immigration overhaul attempt, praises Rubio's leadership and communication skills. He believes that Rubio's emphasis on strong border security and enforcement is resonating with both parties, and that this is a significant factor in the Democrats' growing understanding of the conservative stance on immigration.\n\nIn an effort to prevent the secrecy and rushed process that contributed to the 2007 bill's downfall, Rubio has called for a full committee review. He has also been active behind the scenes, regularly reaching out to conservative media outlets, grass-roots supporters, and House Republicans.\n\nIn January, Rubio brought Enrique Gonzalez, a well-known immigration lawyer based in Miami, onto his staff full-time, and has assigned a legislative assistant to work nearly exclusively on immigration issues. Rubio's commitment to the issue is evident, as Rush Limbaugh himself attested on his show, \"He's insistent this thing not be ramrodded through, that there be hearings.\"\n\nRubio's approach to immigration reform, characterized by transparency, strategic communication, and a focus on border security, could potentially decalcify a process that has been stagnant for a significant period. The future of immigration reform remains uncertain, but Rubio's efforts are undeniably shaping the discourse and strategy in a bid to find a bipartisan solution.",
    " Title: FBI Completes Supplemental Background Check on Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh; Report to be Delivered to Senate Wednesday Evening\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the FBI has reportedly concluded its supplemental background check into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and the Senate is expected to receive the results Wednesday evening, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The report, which is planned to be kept secret, is expected to center around allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he was young.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Wednesday evening, McConnell stated, \"This evening, the Senate will receive the results of the FBI\u2019s supplemental background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.\" He further added, \"This is now the seventh time the FBI has looked into Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s background. And this information comes on top of what has already been one of the most thorough and most exhaustive Senate reviews of any Supreme Court nominee in the entire history of our country.\"\n\nThe report, which is to be transmitted to the Senate tonight, is expected to be a deciding factor for three Republican senators who hold swing votes on Kavanaugh's appointment since conservatives hold a thin 51-49 majority in the Senate. The report's contents could potentially influence these senators' decisions regarding Kavanaugh's appointment.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, who alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens, was not contacted or interviewed by the FBI during its investigation as of late Wednesday. Nor was another woman, Julie Swetnick, who was the third to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Ford's lawyers released a statement late Wednesday night, condemning the investigation being done without Ford's participation.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI's investigation would not be deemed credible without testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh amid reports they might not be interviewed. \"Last week\u2019s hearing is no substitute for FBI interviews, especially when you consider the tenor of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony,\" Feinstein said in a statement. \"We have asked repeatedly for the White House to provide us with the scope of the investigation and what restrictions they placed on the FBI. The White House continues to refuse to answer. It\u2019s completely unacceptable to hide this information from the Senate and the public.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for a slowdown in the process, suggesting senators should have a day to study the FBI report before deciding Kavanaugh's fate. \"A Supreme Court nominee must, whatever their politics, be a shining example of someone who tells the truth,\" Schumer tweeted. \"Every Senator now must assess these serious allegations, and consider whether Judge Kavanaugh has the temperament, independence, and credibility to serve.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, whose votes are considered key to the nomination, both said they were satisfied with the pace of the process. McConnell noted that only senators would be able to see the report. He did not say how long he'd wait to schedule a vote after the report was released, but a full vote on Kavanaugh could happen as early as Saturday afternoon if the Senate is ordered to work over the weekend. President Donald Trump also expects there to be a vote by week's end.",
    " Title: Republicans Eye Bipartisan Elements in ObamaCare for Potential Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, some Republican lawmakers have signaled that they may preserve certain elements of the president's controversial health care overhaul if they were to repeal and replace the law.\n\nSince its inception, conservatives in Congress have been vocal in their disapproval of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. However, as demonstrated by a recent proposal from House conservatives, they aim not just to repeal the law but to replace it with a plan of their own. This new plan would not be ObamaCare, but it could share some similarities with the current law, particularly in areas that have bipartisan support.\n\nMichael Gerson, former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, recently urged Republicans to consider what kind of health care policy they could create, as opposed to simply tearing down the existing one. In an article for The Washington Post, Gerson proposed a Republican plan that would offer a universal credit to anyone not covered by a large employer, and include protections for those without insurance from \"catastrophic expenses.\"\n\nThese ideas would be scaled-back versions of the subsidies and consumer protections currently offered in ObamaCare. The difference, according to Gerson, is that \"Obamacare creates a powerful regulatory mechanism (the exchanges) that mandates comprehensive coverage,\" among other changes.\n\nDavid Kendall, a senior fellow for health and fiscal policy at Third Way, told FoxNews.com that the law is not so dissimilar to versions of health care reform that Republicans have pushed in the past, including a universal plan offered by President Richard Nixon at the end of his term.\n\nAccording to a May 2012 Kaiser Health poll, popular provisions of ObamaCare favored by both parties include allowing children to stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26 and providing subsidies on a sliding scale to those who cannot afford insurance.\n\nRecently, Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called his party's counter-proposal a 180-degree turn from ObamaCare, but a closer look shows some similarities. The American Health Care Reform Act would use some long-standing conservative ideas for health care, like allowing people to buy insurance across state lines, but also give tax deductions, as opposed to subsidies, to help purchase insurance.\n\nThe bill would not include what is perhaps the least popular element of ObamaCare - the mandate on almost everyone to obtain insurance.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points in ObamaCare, as well as in the GOP proposal, is the coverage of adults with pre-existing conditions. Under the ACA, insurers will not be able to turn down consumers who have a history of medical problems or charge them more for coverage.\n\nAmong the most hyped and hated parts of ObamaCare have been the exchanges, which are a centerpiece of the health reform plan. The exchanges are marketplaces where the uninsured go to purchase insurance. The rollout of the main exchange websites, though, has been plagued by problems since their launch on Oct. 1.\n\nThe experience would likely leave Republicans hesitant to try to recreate the exchanges if they ever were in a position to try their own plan. For now, the latest budget fight proved Republicans do not have the numbers or the leverage to repeal - or replace - ObamaCare at this point, and may have to wait until 2016 for their next shot at changing the balance of power.",
    " Title: Trump's Decision on DACA: The Ball Now in Congress' Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and uncertainty, President Donald Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has left the fate of 800,000 immigrants, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" hanging in the balance. The announcement, made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, marked the end of a program that has provided temporary relief from deportation for young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nThe decision, however, was not a unilateral one. Pressured by hard-liners in his administration and constrained by his own campaign rhetoric, the president's decision was a reflection of his impulsive and unpredictable leadership style. In typical fashion, the president quickly undercut his own policy by tweeting that if Congress does not act to fix the problem, he will revisit his decision.\n\nThe ball is now in Congress' court, where it has always been. President Barack Obama's decision to protect Dreamers through executive means was fraught with danger. It was never a permanent fix; it was a temporary solution to ensure that those who had violated U.S. law through no fault of their own could remain in the country they call home without fear of being deported, as long as they obeyed the rules.\n\nThe votes are there to pass a bill to protect childhood arrivals, but it will require bipartisanship, a rarity in the 115th Congress. Democrats are ready to vote for a bill to put Dreamers on the path to citizenship; the issue has become a virtual litmus test on the left. And despite the ugly rhetoric on the right and the anti-immigrant fanaticism in the GOP base, there are enough Republicans who favor helping Dreamers to get legislation through both houses. The trick will be getting a bill to the floor.\n\nTrump may have given House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell the perfect excuse to buck the extremists in their party. In an Oval Office meeting with congressional leaders this week, President Trump decided to back the Democrats' proposal to keep the government funded and raise the debt ceiling for three months instead of seeking a longer-term debt and funding solution favored by his own party. The decision took Republicans by surprise, but it should not have. Trump is nothing if not fickle. He rode Republican anger to the White House, but he has no commitment to conservative principles or loyalty to a party he opportunistically embraced.\n\nThe biggest impediment to passing legislation to give childhood arrivals permanent resident status has been the reluctance of GOP leaders to bring a bill to the floor that the majority of their members do not support. The \"Hastert rule,\" named for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who used it to maintain party discipline, has kept immigration reform from coming to the House floor since 2013 when then-Speaker John Boehner decided to block any immigration reform bill that could not muster majority support among Republicans. But Speaker Ryan could ignore the Hastert rule, which is not a formal part of House rules but only a partisan tactic, and allow one of the fixes to move forward.\n\nPresident Trump has done his best to humiliate Republican leaders in Congress, so why do they owe him any degree of loyalty? If Congress hopes to accomplish anything in the next year and a half, McConnell and Ryan will have to carve out a path of their own. It can begin with recognizing that Dreamers are Americans in every way that matters. Half of Dreamers came when they were 6 years old or younger. They have attended American schools, graduated, and gone on to be employed at rates higher than their American-born peers. They can and should be asked to give back to the country by paying taxes and serving in the U.S. military\u2014but they won't be able to do those things without permanent resident status. The alternative would be to deport hundreds of thousands of young, productive workers. Why would anyone want to see that happen?\n\nMcConnell and Ryan should reach across their respective aisles and enlist the votes to pass immigration reform. It's the right thing to do.",
    " Title: New Polls Show Obama Leading Romney in Three Swing States, Economy Remains Top Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nA new series of polls in three crucial swing states, Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, indicate President Barack Obama exceeding 50% support among likely voters and holding leads of nine to 12 points over Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The latest surveys, conducted by Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times and Franklin and Marshall College, suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, an issue that has been the cornerstone of his campaign.\n\nThe new polls show Obama with an advantage in four battleground states. In Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, which together account for 67 electoral votes, the president leads Romney 53% to 43% among likely voters according to the Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll. The Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times is the fourth non-partisan, live-operator survey to be conducted in Ohio over the past two weeks. A CNN Poll of Polls that averages all five surveys puts Obama at 51% and Romney at 44% among likely voters.\n\nIn Florida, the Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times survey indicates the president at 53% and Romney at 44%. Five non-partisan, live-operator polls have been conducted in the Sunshine State since mid-month. A CNN Poll of Polls that averages all five surveys puts Obama at 50% and Romney at 45% among likely voters.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey puts the president at 54% and the former Massachusetts governor at 42%. And the Franklin and Marshall poll indicates Obama holding a 52%-43% advantage. The nine-point margin is just within the survey's sampling error for likely voters.\n\nThe economy remains the top issue for Americans when it comes to their vote for president. In Ohio and Florida, voters are split down the middle on whether the country and they and their families are worse or better off than they were four years ago. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute's Peter A. Brown said, \"If voters do not think they are worse off, it is difficult to see them throwing out an incumbent whose personal ratings with voters remains quite high.\"\n\nThe polls come one week before the first presidential debate in Denver. The three presidential showdowns are Romney's best chance to try and change the numbers. Early voting is already underway in a handful of states, and Iowa becomes the first battleground state to begin early voting on Thursday.",
    " Title: Obama's Budget Plan Proposes Changes to Social Security and Medicare, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's upcoming budget plan, set to be unveiled on Wednesday, will propose changes to Social Security and Medicare, along with new tax increases, in an attempt to reach a deal with Republicans on deficit reduction. The plan, which includes a $400 billion savings to Medicare over 10 years, has drawn criticism from liberal groups.\n\nThe progressive group MoveOn.org labeled the president's proposed changes to Social Security as \"unconscionable,\" while Democracy for America called the cuts \"profoundly disturbing.\" Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn, stated, \"Millions of MoveOn members did not work night and day to put President Obama into office so that he could propose policies that would hurt some of our most vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe budget plan is a revival of an offer Obama made to House Speaker John Boehner in December. The proposal includes $400 billion in savings to Medicare over 10 years. However, House Speaker John Boehner stated that he and the president were never able to reach an agreement, with Boehner citing that Obama's \"offers never lived up to his rhetoric.\"\n\nFor Social Security, Obama plans to propose a switch to a key Republican request called \"chained CPI,\" which is an inflation formula. Proponents argue that chained CPI is a more accurate way to measure inflation than the current method, as it overstates growth in consumer prices. However, some critics have contended that chained CPI is not a better way to measure inflation for Social Security recipients, as they spend a significant amount on health care, which rises faster than inflation.\n\nThe new budget is expected to lead to $1.8 trillion in savings over 10 years and replace the forced budget cuts that took effect on March 1, also known as the sequester. The budget will also fund initiatives outlined in Obama's State of the Union address, including universal access to prekindergarten education, which will be paid for by increases to cigarette taxes.\n\nAdditionally, the plan will close a current loophole that allows people to collect disability and unemployment benefits at the same time, a move that could create savings for the government, officials said.\n\nThe White House had previously only revealed that the budget was coming the week of April 8, without specifying a date. Republicans were sharply critical of the delay, which came after protracted negotiations over spending cuts and tax rates.",
    " Title: G-7 Summit: Russia-Ukraine Tensions and ISIS War Dominate Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe G-7 summit, held in Germany this past weekend, saw the leaders of the world's industrialized democracies grapple with two significant global issues: the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and the war against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria.\n\nRussia's absence from the summit for the second consecutive year marked a continued estrangement following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The G-7 nations, in response, expelled Russia from their annual meeting and imposed sanctions last year due to its actions in Crimea and its support of pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.\n\nDuring a casual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Barack Obama expressed his commitment to countering Russian aggression in Ukraine. Both leaders agreed that the sanctions against Russia should remain in place until Russian President Vladimir Putin fully complies with the terms of the peace accord reached in Minsk last February.\n\nPutin, in response, maintained that Russia's actions in Crimea, Ukraine, and elsewhere are defensive, not offensive, and that the West has nothing to fear from Russia. Some European officials share this perspective, and they may seek to weaken the sanctions against Russia, potentially without the support of the United States and Germany.\n\nIn addition to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war against ISIS was another pressing concern for the G-7 leaders. The general leading the effort to recapture Ramadi and other areas in Anbar province reported that the Iraqi military has secured the defense lines leading to Baghdad. However, the progress made against ISIS has been limited, with the terrorist group making gains in both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThis has led some European leaders to question the effectiveness of Obama's foreign policy strategy, with criticism not only coming from domestic critics in the United States, but also from America's closest allies. The G-7 summit provided a platform for these leaders to discuss and potentially reevaluate their strategies in dealing with these complex and pressing global issues.",
    " Title: Record-Breaking Gun Sales and Background Checks in 2019: A Look at the Surge in Firearm Purchases and FBI's Response\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is grappling with a significant increase in background checks this year, following a series of mass shootings that have reignited calls for stricter gun control laws. The surge in background checks, often used as a rough indicator of gun sales, has been particularly pronounced in August and September, following attacks in El Paso and Odessa, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left 38 people dead.\n\nLarry Keane, general counsel for the firearms industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, noted that the spike in background checks can be attributed to people's perceived threats to their Second Amendment rights. This trend has been ongoing since August.\n\nWhile the FBI does not track gun sales, as multiple firearms can be purchased in a single transaction, its National Instant Criminal Background Check System provides a means to gauge market demand. For the first time since the bureau began conducting checks in 1998, the number of monthly checks has not dipped below 2 million this year. With the holiday shopping season approaching, the number of background checks for 2019 could surpass the one-year record of 27.5 million, according to bureau records.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the industry may be emerging from the \"Trump slump\" that followed the election of the pro-gun president. Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York in Cortland who has written extensively on guns, commented that the rising numbers may indicate a reawakened gun owner community.\n\nIn 2016, when the Obama administration sought tougher gun control legislation, the FBI was inundated with requests for background checks, processing a record number of checks that year. This year, the FBI has requested additional funding and personnel to manage the workload. FBI Director Christopher Wray, in testimony before a House committee, cited increasing background checks in his request for 40 new positions and $4.2 million. Some of the money would be used for new equipment.\n\nThe FBI has dealt with the volume by reassigning nearly 300 people at various times, causing backlogs elsewhere, according to the budget request. In a written statement, the FBI stated that it has sought to make the background check system more efficient, but the \"volume of calls (and) complexity of the work\" have forced it to request more resources.\n\nThe FBI has faced criticism for problems with its background check system, most recently in 2017, when the Air Force failed to provide the FBI with the criminal record of a man who went on to massacre 26 people at a Texas church. Devin Kelley's conviction of domestic assault at a court martial a few years earlier would have barred him from purchasing the rifle used in the attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department reported that the military and other federal agencies had increased their submissions of criminal and mental health records to the background check system by more than 6% in the past year. A 2018 law passed in the wake of the Texas church shooting, known as the Fix NICS Act, requires agencies to ensure they share such information with the FBI.\n\nGun check numbers need only remain steady for the rest of the year to break the record. The FBI recorded nearly 23 million checks through the end of October. However, the political calendar and unrelenting gun violence is likely to keep up demand for firearms.\n\nIn September, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke caused perhaps the biggest stir during a Democratic presidential debate when he called for mandatory buybacks of popular semi-automatic rifles used in some recent attacks, including the El Paso assault. That shooting left 22 dead at a local Walmart. O'Rourke's remarks drew both plaudits and rebukes.\n\nMatt Boggs, co-owner of Alpha Dog Firearms, reported a significant increase in gun sales following O'Rourke's comments. Boggs slashed prices for a weeklong \"Beto Special\" and sold more than 400 firearms during the sale, compared to the typical monthly sales of about 100 guns.\n\n\"We did it because someone had the audacity to come after a U.S. citizen's rights,\" Boggs said in an interview. \"A lot of (military) veterans are our customers. It had a reaction.\"\n\nTwo months after the gun rush, Boggs said visitors from New York, Texas, California, and other states stop by to express their support.\n\n\"We have veterans coming back from Afghanistan and Japan dropping by to say they had heard about what we did,\" Boggs said.\n\nO'Rourke is out of the presidential race, but there is no sign that gun politics will leave the stage with him. Michael Bloomberg, who has poured millions of dollars into campaigns advocating for tighter controls on firearms, formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination Sunday.\n\nSeveral of the leading candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called for measures including bans on assault-style weapons, universal background checks, and voluntary gun buybacks.\n\n\"If Bloomberg jumps in with both feet, that could move (gun sales) further along,\" Keane said. \"There is such a stark contrast between the two (parties), guns will be just as important in 2020 as they were in 2016.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Campaign Advertising Suspended in Colorado Following Tragic Shooting Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare display of unity amidst political differences, both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have suspended their campaign advertisements in Colorado following the tragic shooting incident in Aurora that left at least 12 people dead and dozens more injured. The move was also followed by two major super PACs, acknowledging the inappropriateness of continued political attacks during this sensitive time.\n\nAndrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, confirmed the suspension of ads, stating, \"We are pulling all ads in Colorado until further notice.\" Jen Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, echoed the sentiment, saying, \"The president's ads are being taken down as well.\"\n\nAmerican Crossroads and its sister organization, Crossroads GPS, which have spent millions of dollars attacking President Obama in Colorado, also confirmed the suspension of their ads. Steven Law, the group's president, said, \"In moments of tragedy like the Aurora shooting, we all stand together as Americans.\"\n\nA super PAC supporting President Obama, Priorities Action USA, also announced the suspension of their ads.\n\nColorado, one of the battleground states, has been a focal point for a fierce advertising war, with most ads being attack ads. President Obama's campaign had been airing three searing attacks on Mitt Romney in Colorado. One mocked Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, by showing him singing \"America the Beautiful\" as headlines about his holdings in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands flashed on the screen. Another cited Romney's opposition to abortion, and a third said his economic plan would raise taxes on 18 million working families.\n\nThe two English-language ads Mitt Romney had been running in Colorado accused President Obama of showering his friends and campaign contributors with federal stimulus dollars and of lying about Romney's business record.

Tensions over protocol began as soon as Air Force One touched down in Hangzhou on Saturday, with no mobile staircase prepared for the U.S. president to exit the front door of the plane, forcing him to leave via the lower back door, which has its own stairs. He was also the only national leader not to be provided with red carpet on arrival.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the opening ceremony on Sunday afternoon, Obama said, \"I think this time, the seams are showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes.\" He added, \"When delegations travel to the United States, sometimes there are issues about our security procedures and protocols that they're aggravated with but do not always get reported on.\"\n\nThe tensions did not detract, according to Obama, \"from the broader scope of the relationship.\" He pointed out that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping continued their historic joint project to elevate climate change issues and had productive bilateral discussions on Saturday, touching on the environment, the South China Sea, protectionism, and human rights.\n\nThe two parties, the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitters, announced they would formally join the Paris Climate Change Agreement. \"Where countries like China and the United States are prepared to show leadership and to lead by example, it is possible for us to create a world that is more secure, more prosperous, and more free than the one that was left for us,\" Obama said in announcing America's adoption of the agreement.\n\nDespite this and other points of agreement, there was plenty of evidence of tension. Chinese officials blocked U.S. traveling media from watching the president disembark, shouting \"this is our country\" at a U.S. diplomat when she tried to argue this was not the norm for presidential arrivals.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice and her deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, were also blocked from approaching President Obama on the tarmac. Later, she said the Chinese had done things that \u201cweren\u2019t anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe tussles continued as the Chinese reportedly cut American press access to the bilateral events. When Obama and Xi went for a walk along Hangzhou's famous West Lake in the evening, the press pack was reduced from six to one, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAt the same time as playing down the tensions, the president also defended media norms in the U.S. and other Western nations. \"We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing, that they have the ability to answer questions,\" Obama told members of the media on Saturday. \"And we do not leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips.\"",
    " Title: Chief Justice John Roberts Admonishes Senate During Heated Impeachment Trial Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a rare intervention during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts admonished the House managers and the president's counsel for their heated exchanges over amendments to the resolution outlining the rules and format of the trial. Roberts emphasized the need for civility and respect in the Senate, reminding the participants that they are addressing the world's most deliberative body.\n\nRoberts' intervention came during an argument over whether former national security adviser John Bolton should be subpoenaed to testify before the Senate. To illustrate his point about the expected level of civility, Roberts referred to an incident from the impeachment trial of Florida District Judge Charles Swayne in 1905, when a senator objected to a House manager using the term \"pettifogging.\"\n\n\"In the 1905 Swayne trial, a senator objected when one of the managers used the word 'pettifogging.' And the presiding officer said the word ought not to have been used. I don't think we need to aspire to that high of a standard, but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe heated argument between Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and White House counsel Pat Cipollone saw Nadler accuse senators who voted against calling Bolton to testify of being \"part of the cover-up.\"\n\n\"Either you want the truth and you must permit the witnesses or you want a shameful cover-up. History will judge and so will the electorate,\" Nadler said.\n\nCipollone, in response, called for Nadler to apologize to the Senate, the president, and \"most of all, you owe an apology to the American people.\"\n\n\"Mr. Nadler came up here and made false allegations against our team. He made false allegations against all of you. He accused you of a cover-up,\" Cipollone said. \u201cThe only one who should be embarrassed, Mr. Nadler, is you for the way you've addressed this body. This is the United States Senate. You're not in charge here.\"\n\nRoberts' admonishment marked his first major intervention in the trial. The chief justice strives to keep the Supreme Court above the daily political fray.\n\n\"This is his most prominent chance on the national stage to show his commitment to being a fair, neutral arbiter,\" said Jeffrey Rosen, president of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. \u201cChief Justice Roberts cares more than anything about the nonpartisan, institutional legitimacy of the courts.\"",
    " Title: Vox Media Implements Furloughs and Pay Cuts for Staff Amidst Economic Challenges Caused by COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that reflects the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the media industry, Vox Media has announced it will furlough 9% of its staff from May 1 through July 31. A source familiar with the matter told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that health insurance premiums will be fully covered during this period.\n\nThe decision comes as one of the many media companies taking drastic measures to navigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus. Last week, Vox Media solicited donations from readers, signaling its financial struggles. The digital publishing company owns popular brands such as Eater, SB Nation, New York Magazine, and The Strategist.\n\nIn addition to layoffs, Vox Media is implementing several other cost-saving measures. About 1% of staff are moving to reduced hours from May 1 through July 31, with health insurance premiums still fully covered. There will also be a temporary tiered pay reduction for employees starting at an annual salary of $130,000 for the same time period.\n\nFurthermore, 401(k) matches will be suspended through the end of 2020, and there will be a freeze on merit-based increases and promotions. In a memo to staff on Friday, Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff wrote, \"The expectations that we had just a few weeks ago for our business and our lives no longer apply.\" He added, \"When I say it\u2019s our goal to limit the impact on our employees, I mean it.\"\n\nThe pandemic has forced numerous major media companies to implement layoffs and pay cuts. Group Nine Media, which includes brands like Thrillist, Seeker, The Dodo, PopSugar, and NowThis, laid off 7% of its workforce last week. Bustle Digital Group laid off two dozen staffers in early April and shuttered its tech website The Outline. Cheddar, BuzzFeed, and dozens of other digital-native websites have also resorted to layoffs, furloughs, and other measures to survive the pandemic.\n\nAs the digital news industry grapples with a tough economic outlook, it's essential to remember that Vox Media laid off roughly 50 staffers in 2018. The company also laid off hundreds of freelancers last year, following a new law passed in California that reclassified freelance journalists as contract workers.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 138,000 Jobs in May; Unemployment Rate Dips Slightly to 4.3%\n\nThe U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs in May, according to the monthly jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday. The national unemployment rate nudged lower, to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent - a 16-year low.\n\nThe jobs numbers were not as strong as some were hoping to see. Economists had been expecting job gains of about 185,000, and to see the unemployment rate holding steady. Last month's report initially showed job creation bouncing back in April, with the economy adding 211,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls. That figure was revised to 174,000 on Friday, a drop of 37,000. Revisions also cut disappointing March results even further, from a gain of 79,000 to a gain of only 50,000 jobs.\n\nThe numbers suggest job growth is slowing slightly, with an average gain of roughly 121,000 jobs over the past three months, compared with an average of 181,000 over the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, in May, the number of unemployed Americans (6.9 million) remained essentially unchanged from the previous month. Since January, the unemployment rate has declined by 0.5 percentage point, and the number of unemployed has decreased by 774,000, according to the BLS.\n\nAmong the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs declined by 211,000 to 3.3 million in May, according to the BLS report.\n\nThe Department of Labor also recently released more specific data about the job markets in different U.S. cities. For metropolitan areas in April, the agency says Ames, Iowa, and Boulder, Colorado, had the lowest unemployment rates, at 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. The highest unemployment rate was in El Centro, California, at 19.2 percent.\n\nFor large cities (with a population over 1 million in the 2010 Census), the Denver area had the lowest unemployment rate, at 2.1 percent. The highest rate was in the Cleveland area, at 5.4 percent.",
    " Title: Republican Establishment Rallies Behind Trump as Party Base Shifts Right\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presidential election enters its final days, a noticeable shift has occurred within the Republican Party, with the reluctant GOP establishment re-endorsing Donald Trump following a series of high-profile endorsements. The move is seen as a calculated bet that the party's nominee will come close enough to make it necessary to back him, lest they be blamed for his failure.\n\nJason Chaffetz, the former House Oversight Committee chair, is among the most prominent figures who have returned to Trump's camp after initially distancing themselves. Chaffetz, who is rumored to harbor hopes that Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will win to fuel his political investigations, felt it necessary to endorse Trump in case of a close race. Chaffetz is also reportedly considering a bid for speaker if there is a rebellion against Paul Ryan, a real possibility.\n\nSen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama, and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota have all re-endorsed Trump after withdrawing their support in the wake of the \"grab 'em by the pussy\" tape. Even Trump skeptic and Beltway conservative Hugh Hewitt has joined the bandwagon.\n\nThe shift in the Republican Party has left many elites and conservative pundits grappling with the reality that their voters hold a different interpretation of conservatism. The elites define Reagan's famous \"three-legged stool\" of conservatism as \"economic conservatism,\" \"social conservatism,\" and \"defense conservatism,\" which they describe as a belief in small government, family values, and patriotism, all wrapped in philosophical rhetoric about freedom, the founders, and the Constitution.\n\nHowever, Trump has shown that the base of the party also believes in these three pillars, but the Republican establishment has stripped away the intellectual veneer, revealing that the three legs represent racism, sexism, and nationalism. Economic conservatism is merely a means to stop the federal government from spending money on \"the wrong people.\" Social conservatism is a way to keep women in their place, and defense conservatism is a chauvinistic belief that America is for Americans, and foreigners had better watch their step.\n\nA new Pew Research Center poll reveals that the hope among GOP elders that they can return to the previous status quo, where everyone pretends the party's base cares about tort reform and the capital gains tax, is not going to happen. The best they can say is that Republicans are deeply divided. The poll states that two-thirds of Republican and Republican-leaning voters think their party's presidential candidate represents the core principles and positions the Republican Party should stand for, while 31% think Trump does not.\n\nThe divide manifests itself in many ways, with those who did not vote for Trump in the primaries showing a stronger dislike for the Republican Party as a whole. Trump voters, on the other hand, seem to like the party just fine now that Trump has defined what it stands for.\n\nThe post-election landscape remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Republican Party has been irrevocably changed by Trump's candidacy. Whether Trump wins or loses, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle, no matter how hard the \"Never Trump\" types try.\n\nTrump had only a couple of deeply held political beliefs that he brought with him into the campaign. He has long believed that foreign countries are laughing at America and he wants to make them stop. He has always wanted to let police take the gloves off and enforce law and order. Everything else in his \"platform,\" from birtherism to the border wall and from torture to terrorism, he got from conservative media.\n\nAccording to New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman, Trump's earliest advisers, going back to 2012, were notorious trickster Roger Stone and right-wing lawyer Sam Nunberg. Their reports indicated that the GOP base was frothing over a handful of issues, including immigration, Obamacare, and Common Core. While Jeb Bush talked about crossing the border as an \"act of love,\" Trump was thinking about how high to build his wall.\n\nNow, Trump has Breitbart's Steve Bannon in his ear with the alt-right agenda, much of which sounds familiar as well. These ideas have been swirling around right-wing media for years, while the political establishment was holding seminars on \"Atlas Shrugged\" and fetishizing the budget deficit. Conservatism is Trumpism\u2014and has been for a long time. So-called conservatives just weren't listening.",
    " Title: The Trans-Pacific Partnership: A Strategic Approach to Security and Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from traditional foreign policy focus, President Obama has been actively engaging in the Philippines and Malaysia, aiming to strengthen alliances and build multilateral organizations in Asia. While the American public's attention is primarily on national security and the Middle East, the President's emphasis on trade in the Pacific Rim is a strategic move, given the economic and security implications.\n\nThe economic cornerstone of America's Asia policy is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive trade and investment pact among 12 countries representing 40% of the global GDP and 30% of global trade. The TPP, which is under Congressional review, is a significant step towards a potential Free Trade Area of the Pacific, eventually including all 21 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries and potentially non-APEC countries such as India and Columbia.\n\nWhile the economic benefits of the TPP, such as economic growth and job creation, have been the primary focus of the debate, there is another less-discussed aspect that reinforces the economic arguments in support of the pact: its impact on security. The TPP's provisions and the deeper engagement with trading partners will be crucial in protecting the United States from a wide variety of non-traditional security risks.\n\nThese risks, often borderless in nature, include the re-emergence of pandemic diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS), natural disasters, illegal fishing, deforestation, and illegal animal trafficking. By streamlining customs and other procedures to expedite the flow of goods across borders, the TPP will enhance the capacity of our trading partners to respond to these challenges.\n\nThe TPP also addresses some non-traditional risks more explicitly, such as improving transparency and non-discrimination provisions with regard to state-linked companies and government procurement. The TPP is more than the sum of its terms; it is a capacity-builder promoting a more peaceful and prosperous world.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly intertwined, the non-traditional security challenges we face also grow. The TPP will help manage these risks by raising the capital of our trade partners and binding us together in the common cause of promoting a rules-based, sustainable global economy. Such an alliance will be necessary if we are to lessen the impact of the risks we all face.\n\nDavid Carden, a partner with law firm Jones Day, is the former U.S. ambassador to ASEAN. David Adelman, a partner with the law firm Reed Smith, is the former U.S. Ambassador to Singapore. The TPP is more than just a trade deal; it is a strategic approach to security and economic growth in the Pacific Rim.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Hear Landmark Case on Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court has announced that it will hear a case challenging President Obama's 2014 executive actions aimed at protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The decision to hear the case indicates a likely ruling by the end of June.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by 26 states, argues that the president overstepped his constitutional authority by implementing these executive actions. However, the argument for the states' standing to sue in the first place and the substantive claims of the lawsuit have been questioned.\n\nThe United States is home to over 11 million undocumented immigrants. Given the nation's resources and political will, it is widely accepted that mass deportation is not a feasible solution. A more pragmatic approach is to focus on removing those who pose a threat to public safety while deferring action on most of the rest, allowing them to \"come out of the shadows.\"\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which granted work permits and exempted young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. In November 2014, the president announced the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA), a plan to offer work permits and a three-year reprieve from deportation to as many as five million undocumented parents of American citizens or permanent residents, provided they had no criminal record and had lived in the country at least five years.\n\nThe issue of integrating undocumented immigrants into society is not a new one. In a 1980 presidential debate, George Bush criticized harsh efforts to marginalize undocumented immigrants, stating, \"We're creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law.\" President Obama, along with other pragmatic politicians on both the left and the right, shares this perspective, but congressional Republicans have thus far refused to pass any meaningful immigration reform.",
    " Title: Gun Control Advocacy Shifts from Capitol Hill to Main Street, with Local Events and Grassroots Organizations Taking the Lead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre last December, President Barack Obama called for an end to the nation's indifference towards gun violence. However, a year and a failed Senate vote later, the major players in the gun control push have retreated from the public eye, with the fight moving from Capitol Hill to Main Street.\n\nThe shift from immediate legislative action in Congress to local events and grassroots organizing is a response to the reality of a divided Congress and the recognition that the NRA's influence is formidable. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which successfully pressured Starbucks into banning guns from its cafes this summer, is preparing a similar campaign aimed at McDonald's.\n\nSaturday's anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy was not marked by a significant political event in Washington D.C. The Newtown families requested a solemn remembrance, and the White House and major gun control organizations complied. President Obama marked the massacre's anniversary with a private moment of silence at the White House.\n\nGun control advocates have learned political lessons from the Newtown shooting, where the Senate waited four months to vote on background check legislation. Not only did they lose momentum and give the NRA a chance to rally its supporters, but the 20 years of inaction on gun control meant lawmakers were not well-versed on the issue.\n\n\"The infrastructure just wasn't there to turn it around quickly\u2014the knowledge wasn't there among Hill staff, among members of Congress who hadn't voted on it for a decade,\" said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, the director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \"Now all of us know a heck of a lot more about this. We won't need to take so much time to figure that out. If there is a tragedy that specifically involves one of the policies we're talking about, we'll see more swift action.\"\n\nLast year, when Obama returned to Washington after speaking at the Newtown memorial service, Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, was the first gun control activist to get a White House meeting. This was in part because he was the only game in town. However, in the past year, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Sandy Hook Promise, and Moms Demand Action have all formed. The post-Obama campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action launched in January with gun violence prevention as one of its four main policy areas.\n\nThe low-key events held on the anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy are intended to keep activists engaged and lawmakers from forgetting the issue. They are also planning for the midterm elections while preparing a response for the next mass shooting.\n\n\"I hope there's not a next time, but if there is, we've laid the groundwork; we've got momentum across the country,\" said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats' gun violence task force.\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, is at the forefront of this effort. Watts, a mother and stepmother of five, is the head of an organization vying to become the MADD of gun control. Watts hopes to make background checks a women's issue, similar to abortion rights, to force candidates, particularly Democrats, to take a firm stance on the issue. The McDonald's campaign, following the successful Starbucks effort, is just the beginning.\n\n\"There are more white whales out there,\" Watts said in an interview at a Capitol Hill Starbucks.",
    " Title: A Reflection on 2016 Elections: An Analysis of Predictions and President Trump's Character\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, introspection is a natural response, even for those who, like the author, predicted a different outcome. The author, a committed \"Never Trump\" conservative, acknowledges the disappointment and criticism from the right, but maintains that the claim of being \"wrong about everything\" is more a reflection of the critics than of the author himself.\n\nThe author admits to getting the election wrong, but argues that this does not equate to being wrong about Trump as a person. The author's assertion that Trump's character is destiny is central to the analysis. The author believes that Trump's unrestrained ego, impoverished impulse control, and contempt for policy due diligence are significant factors that will shape his presidency.\n\nThe author is surprised by Trump's cabinet appointments and policy proposals, finding them reassuring from a conservative perspective. The author also acknowledges the benefits of having a political novice in the White House, citing Trump's disruption of traditional political norms as a potential upside.\n\nHowever, the author expresses concern about Trump's character, particularly his blas\u00e9 attitude towards intelligence briefings, Twitter diplomacy, and nuclear arms policy. The author is hopeful that Trump's serious and sober-minded advisors will help constrain and contain the dangerous aspects of his character.\n\nIn conclusion, the author does not feel repentant but acknowledges the need for introspection. The author is willing to revisit the refusal to ask for forgiveness if Trump's advisors are successful in managing the dangerous aspects of his character. The author's analysis provides a nuanced perspective on the 2016 election, offering insights into both the author's own predictions and the character of the newly elected president.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Government Funding Deal Stalled Amidst Border Wall Impasse as Shutdown Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, a bipartisan deal to fund the government seems increasingly unlikely, with the border wall issue continuing to stall negotiations. With President Donald Trump out of office, a resolution might have been expected to sail through Congress, but his insistence on border wall funding has left lawmakers at an impasse.\n\nThe House and Senate adjourned on Thursday without a clear strategy to prevent a partial government shutdown next week, putting Congress on the brink of an intractable conflict that could last through New Year's Day. This stalemate could result in the furloughing of hundreds of thousands of workers and cost taxpayers millions.\n\nLawmakers from both parties are expressing frustration, stating that there is no discernible plan to prevent a partial government shutdown. Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, expressed this sentiment, stating, \"There is no discernable plan... Everybody's looking to [Trump] for a signal about what he wants to do. So far, it's not clear.\"\n\nThe House is not planning to return until the night of Dec. 19, leaving only about 72 hours to reach a border wall deal that has eluded both parties for months. Democrats say they are waiting on Republicans, and Republicans say they are waiting on Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appear to be in a standoff, with neither side engaging in formal negotiations for more than two weeks, according to a Democratic aide. The House, too, has been largely silent, with no clear plan of action emerging.\n\nRepublicans have rejected the Democratic proposal to freeze the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, including border fencing, through next October, while approving new funding for the rest of the government. However, Democrats claim they have had no response from the GOP since this proposal was presented.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, some Republicans are suggesting delaying the decision until House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) takes over leadership in the House on Jan. 3, while others want to move the deadline to Dec. 26 to give them a few days off for Christmas. Another idea under consideration is a long-term funding bill that would freeze funding through October 2019.\n\nSix of the seven spending bills are ready to go next week, which would make up nearly $200 billion in total spending. However, Republican leaders in the House are refusing to put any spending package on the floor that doesn't include border wall money.\n\nDemocratic leaders have criticized Trump for his willingness to shutter one-quarter of the government over the holidays, delaying paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, in the name of securing border wall funding. As the new Democratic majority in the House prepares to take over, it seems that an ugly shutdown fight could continue into the early days of 2019.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Puerto Rico Relief Efforts, Acknowledges Challenges Amidst Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump defended his administration's response to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, dismissing critics of his relief efforts as \"fake news\" and \"politically motivated ingrates.\"\n\n\"We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico,\" Trump said. \"Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates... people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military.\"\n\nTrump's comments come after a series of tweets on Saturday, in which he directly targeted the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, who had questioned the pace of relief efforts to the island battered by Hurricane Maria.\n\nWhile Trump accused the mayor of acting at the behest of Democrats \"to be nasty to Trump,\" Cruz said she was only appealing for quicker help to save lives.\n\n\"I was not saying anything nasty about the president,\" Cruz told MSNBC.\n\nMore: Trump blasts Puerto Rican mayor for 'poor leadership' in hurricane relief crisis\nMore: Trump resumes defense of Puerto Rico disaster response, with apparent attack on San Juan mayor\nMore: Former CIA director obliquely questions Trump's leadership in Puerto Rico crisis\nMore: By the numbers: Hurricane Maria damage, recovery in Puerto Rico\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit the island Tuesday to review rescue efforts. He may also visit the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is also undergoing a hurricane relief effort. As Trump prepares for the trip, Puerto Rico National Guard Maj. Paul Dahlen said the president\u2019s expected visit to the island is not affecting aid deliveries or any other relief operations.\n\nIn a third tweet on Sunday morning, Trump had kind words for Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, thanking him and \"all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders. Fantastic job!\"\n\nRossell\u00f3 told reporters Sunday that the U.S. Defense Department has increased its presence on the island, and that the emphasis remains on ensuring that \"food, water and other supplies get delivered to the people of Puerto Rico.\" However, when asked whether all buildings were inspected for safety as Trump had claimed, Rossell\u00f3 said: \"I\u2019m not sure about that. There are areas in Puerto Rico that we haven\u2019t gotten in contact.\"\n\nTrump also drew fire on Saturday for saying some people in Puerto Rico \"want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.\"\n\nFEMA Administrator Brock Long said on Fox News Sunday that relief efforts on the island represent one of the most logistically challenging undertakings the country has ever faced, particularly coming so soon on the heels of other hurricanes.\n\nHe acknowledged major challenges remain and there \"still a long way to go,\" but he said a lot has been accomplished.\n\n\"What I do not have patience for is the fact that what we're trying to do and what we have successfully done is we've established a joint field office in San Juan... where we're having daily conversations with all the mayors, we're working with the governor and his leadership to create unified objectives,\" Long said.\n\nLong also dismissed criticism of the federal relief efforts, including from Cruz.\n\n\"We can choose to look at what the mayor spouts off or what other people spout off, but we can also choose to see what's actually being done, and that\u2019s what I would ask,\" Long said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that the San Juan mayor's complaints about the pace of aid were \"unfair\" given everything that's been done.\n\n\"When the president gets attacked, he attacks back,\" Mnuchin said on NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nAfter getting generally high marks for his administration's handling of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Trump has now found himself on the defensive for the preparations for Maria.\n\nPolitical opponents contrasted his approach to Puerto Rico to his recent hurricane recovery efforts in Texas and Florida, for which the president spent the weekend at Camp David working on disaster response and tweeted ongoing messages of support for the damaged areas on the mainland.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaking on CNN's State of the Union, suggested skin color may be a factor in Trump's response. He also noted that Trump tweet-bombed the San Juan mayor from his \"fancy golf club\" in New Jersey, where he is spending the weekend, while mayor Cruz copes with a lack of food, water, and electricity.\n\n\"It is unspeakable,\" Sanders said. \"I don't know what world Trump is living in.\"\n\nOhio Republican Gov. John Kasich, also on CNN, said \"it's not appropriate\" for Trump to criticize public officials who are \"in the middle of a disaster.\"\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the president is saying that, because of the island's location, the recovery project in Puerto Rico was always going to be tougher than the ones in Florida and Texas.\n\n\"This is an island that was absolutely devastated,\" Mulvaney said on CNN. \"This was always going to be harder.\"\n\nCruz herself appeared to dismiss Trump's tweets during an interview on ABC's This Week, saying that \"any dialogue that goes on just has to be able to produce results.\"\n\nAs for Trump's visit, Cruz said, \"If he asks to meet with me, of course I will meet with him.\"",
    " Title: The Impact of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 on Political Polarization in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996, a comprehensive overhaul of US media policy, has been a subject of debate in relation to the rising political polarization in the country. The act, which relaxed ownership regulations, led to an increase in the number of television channels on cable TV systems, including the inception of partisan news outlets like Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nIn today's media environment, the abundance of information available to viewers has allowed for a selective consumption of political content. Studies have shown that partisan news outlets draw distinct audiences, with conservatives favoring Fox News and liberals preferring MSNBC. This availability of content is significant as research indicates that watching content on these outlets contributes to political polarization. Furthermore, increased niche programming allows non-partisans who are not interested in politics to tune out altogether.\n\nOur recent study, published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, suggests that structural changes to media systems, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996, can alter the nature of media effects. Our research found that the relationship between media and polarization changed after 1996, with TV news contributing more to polarization following the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 than it did before.\n\nFrequent consumers of TV news showed greater increases in polarization on a year-to-year basis than individuals who spent less time watching TV news, as illustrated in the figure below. The study indicates that the policy changes may have encouraged the introduction of partisan media outlets and contributed to the increase in horse race coverage that focuses on the positive and negative traits of candidates instead of policy debates.\n\nCritics argue that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to media consolidation, with companies like the Disney Corporation purchasing major TV networks like ABC. Decreased competition among cable companies following the law has also been linked to hikes in cable prices, incentivizing media companies like Fox to create their own cable networks. This led to an increase in the number of cable stations owned by big media companies.\n\nThe addition of partisan news sources to the media system provides viewers with an opportunity to seek out information that supports their extant view of the world. Scholars have noted that when these media conglomerates took control of networks, news coverage suffered. News is now seen as an additional source of profit instead of a public service for viewers. This shift may have contributed to increasing levels of cheap, conflict-oriented programming, which has the potential to increase people's level of polarization.\n\nIn conclusion, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, by encouraging the proliferation of partisan news outlets and altering the nature of media effects, may have inadvertently contributed to the increasing levels of political polarization in the United States.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Pressure to Show More Presidential Tone in Upcoming Republican Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the South Carolina Republican primary vote approaches on February 20, the upcoming debate on Saturday night at 9 p.m. EST is set to be a critical event for the candidates, particularly for Donald Trump, who has a significant lead in the polls. The debate comes at a time of high anxiety for Trump's opponents, who are eager to challenge the New York billionaire before it's too late.\n\nTrump, who won New Hampshire handily on Tuesday after placing second in Iowa on February 1, is in a strong position to secure his party's presidential nomination for the November 8 election, unless he is slowed down in South Carolina.\n\nThe three main contenders aiming to emerge as the top alternative to Trump for mainstream Republicans are Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are also in the race, each with their own image issues to address.\n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye described the debate as a \"melee.\" Attempts to knock down Trump at previous debates have been unsuccessful, with the former reality TV star demonstrating quick wit and a merciless dismissal of his rivals.\n\nTrump's use of vulgar language during the New Hampshire primary campaign, repeating a comment from one of his rallies that Cruz is a \"pussy,\" may raise eyebrows in South Carolina, where evangelicals form an important voting bloc.\n\nAt a candidates' forum at evangelical Bob Jones University on Friday, Bush addressed the front-running candidate's use of obscenities, asking the crowd, \"Is anybody worried about the front-running candidate shouting out obscenities at children?\" Trump was not present, sending instead a surrogate to speak for him, Pastor Mark Burns. When Burns told the crowd that Trump is \"pro-faith,\" someone from the audience shouted, \"Trump is profane.\"\n\nAll candidates have something to prove at the CBS-hosted, two-hour debate, particularly Rubio, who needs to show he can rebound from a disastrous debate performance a week ago in New Hampshire. Kasich must generate more momentum after a second-place finish in New Hampshire, Cruz must solidify his position with evangelical voters, and Bush needs upward movement anywhere he can get it.\n\nCarson, whose campaign has turned anemic, has to show he is still in the race. \"Each has got some image issue they need to fix,\" said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.\n\nIn the lead-up to the debate, Trump has been taking swipes at Cruz and Bush, who finished third and fourth in the New Hampshire primary. Responding to an attack ad run by the Cruz campaign against him, Trump tweeted that he might sue Cruz to settle any remaining questions about whether the Texan can legally run for president since he was born in Canada.\n\nCruz and many legal experts say Cruz meets the constitutional requirements because he was born to an American mother and grew up in the United States. However, Trump, who famously questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship, fired off a tweet against Cruz, stating, \"If @ TedCruz does not clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural-born citizen.\" The Cruz campaign dismissed the blast with spokesman Rick Tyler saying Trump was demonstrating a \"Trumper-tantrum.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Claims of a Rigged Election: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised concerns about the integrity of the November election, suggesting that it could be \"rigged\" against him. This assertion, made at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, and to Fox News host Sean Hannity, follows similar claims made by Trump's unofficial advisor, Roger Stone, in the past few days.\n\nTrump's allegations, however, lack specific details about who would be responsible for rigging the election. Instead, the focus is on the fear that shadowy forces are conspiring to deny America the president it truly wants. This rhetoric mirrors the paranoia of past Republican presidential losers, who have long been suspicious of shady Democrats and biased mainstream media.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has made such claims. During the GOP primaries, he accused the elections of being \"rigged\" when they were not going his way. By making these claims, Trump is laying the groundwork for explaining a potential loss in November, as he cannot admit to losing fair and square, according to his campaign's narrative of America winning under his leadership.\n\nTrump's claims put him in the company of supporters of past Republican presidential losers. In the past, such talk was left to campaign surrogates and random crackpots. In 2012, for instance, conservative activist Dean Chambers ran the website UnskewedPolls.com, claiming polls were weighted too heavily in favor of Democrats. When President Obama instead crushed Mitt Romney, Chambers blamed his failure on voter fraud.\n\nDemocratic-leaning voters have also cried foul over \"stolen\" and \"rigged\" elections, but these cries have generally stayed on the fringes of the party. In 2004, there were calls for contesting the general election results in Ohio over evidence of tampering with electronic voting machines. However, these calls never gained traction at the high levels of John Kerry's campaign.\n\nComparatively, the infamous election of 2000 saw a disinformation campaign by Republicans to convince the public that Democratic officials in Florida had their thumbs on the scale during a recount in Miami-Dade County. This led to the infamous Brooks Brothers riot, where khaki-clad Republicans stormed a meeting of election canvassers who were trying to perform a ballot recount.\n\nIronically, one of the leaders of the Brooks Brothers riot was none other than Trump's current advisor, Roger Stone. Trump's willingness to indulge in claims of stolen elections three months before voting starts is a departure from past practices, legitimizing the fears of the GOP base and indicating that Trump may not accept a loss gracefully. In other words, this election may last well beyond November 8.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: A Call for a \"Smarter\" Government and Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Obama declared that the current state of the union is \"stronger.\" However, this assertion raises questions about the millions of Americans still unemployed, the burdened taxpayers, and the debt burdened upon future generations.\n\nThe President's second-term agenda includes tackling issues such as gun control, global warming, immigration, and raising the minimum wage. Despite his claim that his proposals will not increase the deficit, skepticism remains, given the President's past promises to cut the deficit in half during his first term.\n\nFour years ago, Obama pledged to reduce the deficit, stating that it would require difficult decisions and facing long-neglected challenges. However, the deficit has instead grown significantly, from approximately $10 trillion when he took office to about $16 trillion currently.\n\nThe President's latest plan for job creation was met with a mix of reactions, with some finding it delusional, while others found Vice President Joe Biden's emotional response touching. The address was marked by a thick atmosphere, with even Biden himself appearing to struggle to maintain his composure as Obama presented his proposals.\n\nIn an attempt to keep up, Biden was seen wearing rose-colored glasses and smiling. The address concluded with Obama's call for a \"North Star\" to guide the nation's efforts, a metaphor that drew criticism for its perceived disconnect from reality.",
    " Title: \"John Trumbull's 'Declaration of Independence' - A Historical Inaccuracy with Authentic Portraits\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the United States Capitol, John Trumbull's iconic painting, 'Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776,' has stood as a symbol of the American Revolution for nearly two centuries. However, the painting, while capturing the spirit of the moment, presents a scene that is not entirely historically accurate.\n\nThe painting depicts the five-man committee, including John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In reality, the committee's original draft was reported to the Congress on June 28, and only Jefferson, who chaired the drafting committee, would have submitted the document to the presiding officer. The vote in favor of independence occurred on July 2, and the final text was agreed upon and sent for printing on July 4.\n\nTrumbull also took creative liberties with the physical details of the setting. The delegates did not sit in upholstered mahogany armchairs, and the window treatments were simple blinds, not velvet drapes. No battle flags adorned the rear wall.\n\nHowever, Trumbull's painting is meticulously accurate in two crucial aspects - the likenesses of the men depicted. Trumbull, a skilled miniature portraitist, painstakingly captured the true-to-life faces of the founding fathers. He traveled extensively to sketch or paint in person as many of the surviving signers as he could find. His 30-year-long project, which he began in 1786, saw him painting many of the signatories in locations such as London, Paris, Boston, Charleston, Williamsburg, and Exeter, among others.\n\nTrumbull's commitment to authenticity was particularly evident in the portraits of the men he revered as heroes. As an artist, he took creative liberties with chairs, drapes, and congressional tableaux. But when it came to the likenesses of these historical figures, he prioritized accuracy above all else.\n\nTrumbull, who himself fought in the Revolutionary War, was passionate about preserving the personal resemblance of the \"great actors\" in what he considered \"the noblest series of actions which have ever presented themselves in the history of man.\" Despite the inaccuracies in the setting, his painting remains a powerful testament to the spirit of the American Revolution and the men who played pivotal roles in its inception.",
    " Title: K-pop Fans' Online Activism: A Double-Edged Sword in the Age of Social Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, K-pop fans have found themselves in the limelight this weekend, following their mass registration for President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with the intention of not attending. The event saw the arena appearing more than half empty, leading some to attribute the low turnout to the K-pop fans' actions, although the extent of their impact remains unclear.\n\nThis stunt, viewed by many as a show of solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters and Juneteenth celebrants, follows a series of online activism campaigns by K-pop fans. Earlier this month, they sabotaged a surveillance app used by the Dallas Police Department, an app that the police had encouraged locals to use to report illegal activity among protesters. K-pop fans also recently derailed a \"White Lives Matter\" hashtag, flooding it with pictures and videos of their favorite idols.\n\nWhile these actions have been celebrated by many on the left, including politicians and protesters themselves, they have also sparked discussions about K-pop's history of cultural misappropriation and racism. In recent years, Korean pop idols have been criticized for perpetuating stereotypes about black Americans and for misappropriating black culture, such as wearing cornrows and dreadlocks. Artists have also faced backlash for statements like claiming they are skilled at \"talking Black\" and for racist acts like wearing blackface.\n\nIn an interview for the Reset podcast, Miranda Ruth Larsen, a K-pop fan and cultural studies researcher at the University of Tokyo, whose work focuses on male Korean and Japanese idols and groups, shed light on this issue. \"It sounds sort of racist because it often is racist,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Larsen emphasized that the cultural misappropriation within K-pop should not be solely blamed on the artists. \"So, let's say that a K-pop artist is wearing a controversial hairstyle\u2014like they're wearing dreads or they're wearing cornrows\u2014eight times out of 10, they did not pick that hairstyle,\" she explained. \"The decision for their hairstyle came from a company, came to a manager, came through an entire chain of command that is responsible and culpable for this bad decision.\"\n\nLarsen underscored the importance of understanding this history and the workings of the industry to gain a comprehensive understanding of the recent online activism campaigns coming from K-pop fandoms. Without this context, it's impossible to fully grasp the nature and implications of these campaigns.\n\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588, we strive to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our global audience, with information that has the power to save lives.

    " Title: White House Hesitant to Verify Latest Claims of Chemical Weapons Use in Syria, Cites Lack of Trust as Major Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has not ruled out providing further assistance to Syrian rebels, but has not yet verified the latest claim that the government of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons to kill over 1,000 people. The Obama administration is under pressure to take more decisive action in Syria following opposition claims, but the lack of trust between the Syrian opposition and the U.S. government remains a significant issue.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest stated that an investigation team is currently on the ground in Syria, and the administration is hopeful that the Assad regime will cooperate with the investigation. Earnest added that the outcome of the investigation and the Assad regime's efforts to hinder it will impact the administration's decision on providing additional aid.\n\nThe Obama administration has faced criticism for its response to the Syrian conflict, with some calling for a stronger military aid response. The administration has opted to push for a political solution and provide humanitarian, logistical, and limited weaponry and other hardware. However, identifying which rebel groups to support has been a challenge, as some have ties to militant groups, including some with ties to al Qaeda.\n\nSyrian opposition groups have little faith in the U.S. government, according to experts who have traveled to Syria during the conflict. David Lesch, Middle East history professor at Trinity University and author of \"Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad,\" said, \"Our credibility was not high to begin with and obviously did not improve with time. They basically shrug their shoulders and say, 'Oh well, what is new?' They feel like they are on their own on this.\"\n\nThe administration's response to Syria has been influenced by political mistrust and sharp partisan divisions in Washington, as well as close congressional vetting. Congress is currently on vacation until after Labor Day.\n\nThe latest development in Syria could potentially change the overall calculus for the United States, raising questions about what new steps the U.S. would take, how it would address uncertainty about the rebel makeup, and how it would approach the worsening trust gap on the issue of rebel assistance. The administration's credibility in the region has been damaged by its response to the conflict, with some experts stating that the U.S. has reacted too late and has not kept to its word.\n\nA team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors is currently in Syria to investigate the allegations, and the U.N. Security Council is scheduled to address the issue on Wednesday.",
    " Title: A Historical Perspective on the Evolution of Journalistic Objectivity in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current media landscape, the ideals of journalistic objectivity and accuracy are under scrutiny, with concerns about the increasing partisanship and sloppiness in reporting. This phenomenon, evident in outlets ranging from Breitbart and Fox News on the right to Truthout and HuffPost on the left, has led to a decline in the standards of dispassionate and carefully measured reporting.\n\nHowever, a closer look at American history reveals that this decline is not unprecedented. The standards of fairness and accuracy associated with journalism are not the American norm. These ideals became the norm in the post-World War II era, as the bipartisan centrist-liberal consensus left its mark on the media.\n\nBefore the mid-20th century, newspapers were explicitly tied to different parties and factions, and they regularly used blistering language to denounce those on other sides of political disputes. This informal and blatantly slanted style of reportage continued through the 19th century.\n\nAs political science graduate student Steven Webster recently documented in a series of tweets, newspapers at the time of the country's founding were explicitly tied to different parties and factions. They also published rumors and conspiracy theories alongside factual accounts of events, often mixing the one in with the other.\n\nThis partisan style of reportage continued throughout the 19th century. In the words of historian Christopher Childers, during the Civil War, the partisan press often acted as a part of the campaign apparatus, a standard practice that most Americans accepted. Candidates used partisan newspapers to promote themselves and their platform without worrying about anything resembling the objective journalism that modern political observers claim we have lost.\n\nIt was an anomaly\u2014an extremely salutary one. Just as the United States became a global hegemon at the close of World War II, the American press became professionalized and set itself the goal of serving as an arbiter of extra-partisan truth.\n\nDid it fail? Of course, it did. The new standards were ideals\u2014goals to strive for while often falling short. But they also did lots of good, imposing rigor on reporting and giving journalists formal and informal guidelines about how to report in a trustworthy and fair-minded way about the world. As a result, millions of Americans acquired a rudimentary understanding of the country and the world that, while superficial and biased in favor of the Cold War liberal consensus, enabled voters to come to responsible public judgments and make conscientious civic decisions.\n\nMany reporters, editors, publishers, and broadcast news producers still work very hard to realize these ideals today\u2014reporting aggressively but also with great care, double- and triple-checking sources and facts, reflecting thoughtfully on the competing demands of the public's right to know and the need for government secrecy.\n\nHowever, growing numbers of media companies and personalities are also willing to cut corners or abandon these norms entirely in the pursuit of influence and profit. The result is a reversion to the flagrantly partisan norms that prevailed before the mid-20th century.\n\nThe consequences of this reversion are uncertain, but they are likely to be challenging. The centrifugal forces driving political polarization contribute to the breakdown of trans-partisan journalistic norms, which in turn makes the polarization worse. The feedback loop then breeds cynicism and contributes to the collapse of social trust and the erosion of the authority of all institutions that claim to speak for and act in the name of the common good.\n\nBefore long, it can begin to seem that it's impossible to evaluate the world dispassionately\u2014that claims to objectivity itself are just masks concealing insidious power-grabs. This may sound like a headlong leap into postmodern relativism, but it's really a plunge back into the rancorous squabbles and sometimes insurrectionary clashes of an earlier era in American history\u2014before the country achieved its power and influence on the world stage or attained its still-formidable economic might.\n\nCan the country maintain its power and prestige with a citizenry that treats every item of news about the world with maximal suspicion, and when public debate about matters large and small invariably takes the form of acrimonious partisan vituperation? We do not yet know the answer. But in the coming years, we're likely to find out.",
    " Title: US Health Secretary Calls for Expanded Health Care Access Without 'Reproductive Health and Rights' Term at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered at the United Nations General Assembly today, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar urged world leaders to avoid using the terms \"reproductive health and rights\" in UN documents, stating that they can undermine the role of the family and promote practices like abortion that lack international consensus.\n\nAddressing the assembly alongside health officials from Guatemala, Brazil, Iraq, Poland, and Hungary, Azar argued that there is no international right to an abortion and that these terms should not be used to promote pro-abortion policies and measures. He also emphasized the importance of sex education that appreciates the protective role of the family and does not condone harmful sexual risks for young people.\n\nThe statement, which suggests a stance against abortion, was made during a high-level meeting on universal health coverage. The meeting aims to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage for everyone around the world, which would include access to health care services, medicines, and vaccines. The effort is part of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, under which all countries have committed to try to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.\n\nAzar requested that the UN, including UN agencies, focus on concrete efforts that enjoy broad consensus among member states. He also suggested that only documents that have been adopted by all member states should be cited in UN resolutions.\n\nIn his remarks, Azar spoke on behalf of the United States, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.\n\nAzar concluded by stating that the US supports equal access to health care, which includes but is not limited to reproductive concerns, maternal health, voluntary and informed family planning, HIV, elimination of violence against women and girls, and empowerment to reach the highest standard of health. He urged world leaders to focus on concrete issues and challenges to accelerate access to health for all, emphasizing the importance of international solidarity in building broad consensus among member states.",
    " Title: New CNN/ORC Poll Shows Shift in Midterm Election Outlook for Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC International poll has indicated a significant change in the battle for control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The poll, conducted last week and released Tuesday, shows a 49% to 47% edge for the Republican Party over the Democratic Party in a generic ballot question.\n\nThe poll results mark a 10-point swing from a previous CNN/ORC poll conducted in October, which showed a 50% to 42% advantage for the Democrats. The shift follows a political uproar over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.\n\nPresident Barack Obama acknowledged at a news conference two weeks ago that the problems with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act could hurt Democrats. \"There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they are running or not because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,\" Obama said.\n\nThe CNN/ORC poll shows both parties making gains within their base. According to CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, the biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters, higher-income Americans, and people who live in rural areas, while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among non-white voters and lower-income Americans.\n\n\"If those patterns persist into 2014, it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most, but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care,\" Holland said.\n\nCurrently, the Republicans have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House, with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate. While the generic ballot question is a commonly used indicator in the battle for Congress, the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.\n\n\"There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast, and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections,\" Holland cautions. \"A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot, but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle, thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup.\"\n\nThe poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans, including 749 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

The Pope referred to this behavior as \"spiritual Alzheimer's,\" and spoke out against the \"terrorism of gossip\" and the formation of cliques that can become a cancer threatening the harmony of the Church.\n\nIn his speech, Francis listed 15 \"Ailments of the Curia,\" a list he compiled with footnotes and Biblical references. The annual Christmas greeting comes at a tense time for the Curia, the central administration of the Holy See, which governs the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church. Francis and his nine key cardinal advisers are drawing up plans to revamp the bureaucratic structure, merging offices to make them more efficient and responsive.\n\n\"The Curia is called on to always improve itself and grow in communion, holiness, and knowledge to fulfill its mission,\" Francis said. \"But even it, as any human body, can suffer from ailments, dysfunctions, illnesses.\"\n\nPope Francis, an Argentine, had never worked in the Italian Curia before becoming pope, and some cardinals feel as if an outsider is criticizing what they do not fully understand. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Vatican watcher Marco Politi said that Francis has faced pushback for his progressive social views.\n\n\"Within the Church, there is a tough group of conservative bishops and priests and cardinals, and also very traditionalist bishops and cardinals who are practically against the Pope, who are working against the Pope,\" said Politi. \"They don't like what he wanted to do with the synod about family, to give new possibilities to remarried and divorced people to get the communion, or to have a new look on the homosexual union.\"\n\nFor a complete list of Pope Francis' 15 \"Ailments of the Curia,\" please click here.",
    " Title: Trump's Fact-Bending History: A Look at the President's Record of Distortions and Falsehoods\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, factual accuracy is often a cornerstone of credibility. However, for President Donald Trump, this has not been the case. The President, born in New York City, has been accused of misrepresenting facts, particularly regarding his father's birthplace. Despite being born in Germany, Trump has on multiple occasions claimed his father was born in Germany, a fact that is easily verifiable as inaccurate.\n\nThe question arises: why does Trump persist in this behavior? Trump's history suggests a disregard for facts, bending and breaking them to suit his narrative. For most individuals, getting facts wrong in a public setting is disconcerting and embarrassing. Trump, however, seems to operate differently. Facts are malleable to Trump, shaped to fit the story he is telling about himself. He constructs a heroic narrative of his life, always portraying himself as the victor, and repeats this story consistently. Objective facts are inconsequential to this self-crafted narrative.\n\nThis behavior is troubling but not entirely surprising. What is more perplexing is the seeming indifference among many people towards a President who has made over 9,000 false or misleading statements in his first 802 days in office. Three theories attempt to explain this phenomenon:\n\n1) Baked-in Cake: Trump's penchant for bending (and breaking) the truth is not a new development. During the 2016 campaign, he made numerous exaggerations, distortions, and outright lies. Voters were aware of this, yet 33% still considered him \"honest and trustworthy,\" according to exit polling in 2016. Many voters were unbothered by his dishonesty, prioritizing other issues over truthfulness.\n\n2) All Politicians Lie: During the campaign, voters often responded to Trump's record of false statements with the argument that \"all politicians lie.\" The implication was that Trump, despite his dishonesty, was more transparent about his willingness to say anything to win. This perspective suggests that Trump's over-the-top lies were endearing, a quirky, almost comical aspect of his character that some found appealing.\n\n3) Media Distrust: Trump did not create distrust in the media; however, he has exploited it in unprecedented ways. The term \"fake news\" has become a cultural staple, serving as an ironic punchline for some but still pervasive. The rise of Fox News and its conservative influence has contributed to a political and economic model that profits from convincing people that the media is not only biased but intentionally dishonest. This has led to a situation where Trump supporters dismiss facts reported by mainstream media outlets, labeling them as \"fake news.\"\n\nIn conclusion, President Trump's history of distortions and falsehoods is a complex issue, with many factors contributing to the seeming indifference among his supporters. Understanding this phenomenon requires examining the interplay of Trump's character, the media landscape, and the values and beliefs of his supporters.",

    " Title: Biden's Response to Ukraine Business Dealings Query Sparks Controversy, Raises Questions on Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during a press conference in Los Angeles, former Vice President Joe Biden was questioned about his son Hunter Biden's lucrative job with an oil company owned by an oligarch accused of corruption. The exchange, which has since gone viral, has sparked controversy and raised questions about transparency.\n\nCBS News reporter Bo Erickson asked Biden whether his son's position at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil company, posed a conflict of interest, given Biden's role as the Obama administration's point person for Ukraine policy during the time of his son's employment. Biden's response was sharp, denying any conflict of interest and accusing the reporter of focusing on the wrong issues.\n\n\"It's not a conflict of interest,\" Biden said. \"There's been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period.\"\n\nBiden's response, which came with a raised voice and a finger jab at the reporter, marked the second time in two weeks that he had berated a journalist for questioning him about his son's Ukraine entanglements.\n\nThe Trump campaign has seized on the exchange, with the Trump War Room Twitter account asking, \"What is he hiding?\" Matt Wolking, the Trump campaign's deputy communications director, called Biden's behavior \"bullying\" and suggested that Biden has no good explanation for what many independent observers see as an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nThe exchange comes as House Democrats aim their impeachment inquiry at President Trump, casting a spotlight on Ukraine and its long history of government corruption. In 2016, Biden allegedly threatened to rescind Ukraine's $1 billion in loan guarantees if the government didn't oust Viktor Shokin, the country's top prosecutor, who had targeted Burisma. Biden denies the story, but the charge continues to dog him.\n\nA Monmouth poll released Tuesday found that 43% of Americans believe the story, and it has had an impact on Biden's primary campaign. In May, Biden was the clear front runner, holding a commanding 27-point advantage over second-place Senator Bernie Sanders. However, Biden now holds just a two-point lead over Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nBiden's fundraising is also lagging behind his competitors. Third-quarter figures released this week show that he pulled in $15.2 million in the last three months, a haul that placed him a distant fourth behind Sanders' $25.3 million, Warren's $24.6 million, and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg's $19.1 million.\n\nThe exchange between Biden and the reporter highlights the ongoing scrutiny that both Biden and President Trump face as they campaign for the 2020 presidential election. The controversy surrounding Biden's son's business dealings in Ukraine adds another layer to the complex political landscape of the upcoming election.",

As the dynamics of global power shift, the U.S. must work alongside allies and partners to construct a world that upholds peace, justice, and security.\n\nHowever, a robust economic recovery is crucial to maintain the U.S.'s strength militarily, politically, and diplomatically. The past few years have seen an anemic recovery, weakening the nation's influence and shaking the confidence of friends and allies. To avoid predictions of an American retreat from greatness, pro-growth strategies are needed to revitalize the economy.\n\nFor these reasons, this publication endorses Mitt Romney for president. His experience, strategy, and temperament make him well-suited to lead a strong economic recovery and address the mounting federal debt. Romney understands that the U.S. economy's prosperity at home is intrinsically linked to its influence abroad.\n\nRomney's campaign has presented a strong and mature vision of American leadership, emphasizing that peace abroad depends on American vitality. He is a staunch supporter of alliances, military strength, free trade, and the opposition of weapons of mass destruction proliferation. Moreover, he recognizes the importance of the U.S. assuming a leadership role on the world stage, working towards a world that embodies peace, justice, and democracy.\n\nIn the footsteps of notable secretaries of state such as Condoleezza Rice, James A. Baker, George P. Shultz, and Henry A. Kissinger, Romney is poised to devote himself to building an America that remains the hope of the world.",
    " Title: Classified Cable Suggests U.S. Knew of Security Risks in Benghazi Before Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nA classified cable, reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, reveals that the U.S. Mission in Benghazi convened an emergency meeting less than a month before the deadly attack that claimed the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The cable, marked \"SECRET,\" summarizes an Aug. 15 emergency meeting and indicates that the State Department's senior security officer had concerns about the ability to defend the consulate in the event of a coordinated attack.\n\nThe cable, addressed to the Office of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, states that the Regional Security Officer expressed concerns about the consulate's ability to defend itself due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound. The cable also briefed the Emergency Action Committee on the location of approximately ten Islamist militias and Al Qaeda training camps within Benghazi.\n\nThe cable's details seem to foreshadow the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. compound, which was a coordinated, commando-style assault using direct and indirect fire. Al Qaeda in North Africa and Ansar al-Sharia, both mentioned in the cable, have since been implicated in the consulate attack.\n\nThe cable also warned that the militias in Benghazi were not concerned with any significant retaliation from the Libyan government, which had apparently lost control in Benghazi. The cable also stated that the mission would ask for more help, and that specific requests for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs would be submitted separately.\n\nWhile the administration's public statements have suggested that the attack came without warning, the Aug. 16 cable seems to undercut those claims. It was a direct warning to the State Department that the Benghazi consulate was vulnerable to attack, that it could not be defended, and that the presence of anti-U.S. militias and Al Qaeda was well-known to the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nIn a three-page cable on Sept 11, the day Stevens and the three other Americans were killed, Stevens wrote about \"growing problems with security\" in Benghazi and \"growing frustration\" with the security forces and Libyan police. The ambassador saw both as \"too weak to keep the country secure.\"\n\nWhen asked to respond to a series of questions about the Aug. 16 cable, including who was specifically charged with reviewing it and whether action was taken by Washington or Tripoli, the State Department declined to answer specific questions, citing the classified nature of the cable. The State Department stated that an independent board is conducting a thorough review of the assault on the Benghazi post and will fully address these matters once the board's comprehensive account of what happened, findings, and recommendations are available.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Administration Faces Criticism Over Terrorism Labeling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, police in Nova Scotia have thwarted a plot by two men who intended to carry out a mass shooting at a shopping mall and subsequently commit suicide. The Associated Press reported that the plot was not related to Islamic terrorism. This news has sparked a debate about the Obama administration's approach to terrorism, with some critics arguing that the administration's refusal to associate Islamic terrorists with Islam is leading to flawed understandings of the problem.\n\nThe criticism stems from the Obama administration's stance that Islamic State, al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and the Taliban are not representative of Islam, and therefore should not be associated with the religion. This stance has been met with skepticism, as these groups frequently cite Islam as the basis for their actions.\n\nThe pope and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, along with Jewish leaders and growing numbers of Muslim officials in Arab lands, have been open about the horrors perpetrated in the name of Islam. However, President Obama has been criticized for his refusal to acknowledge the role of Islam in these acts of terrorism.\n\nThe administration's stance has also been criticized in relation to recent attacks on religious minorities. For instance, the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya was linked to a genocidal religious cleansing, with the Islamic butchers calling them \"people of the cross\" and \"crusaders.\"\n\nThe administration's response to the murder of three Muslims in North Carolina, where the killer confessed and denied religion as a motive, has also been criticized. The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation and Obama issued a statement suggesting the murders were hate crimes.\n\nCritics argue that the administration's refusal to acknowledge the role of Islam in terrorism leads to flawed understandings of the problem and missed opportunities for potential solutions. For instance, a State Department official's assertion that jobs programs are part of the answer to terrorism has been met with skepticism.\n\nThe criticism of the Obama administration's approach to terrorism is not isolated to the U.S. Governor Andrew Cuomo is also facing criticism for his handling of corruption in Albany, with some arguing that he is sending mixed messages about his commitment to cleaning up the political culture.\n\nIn other news, the murder rate in St. Louis increased by 33% last year, with 159 murders in a city of 318,000 people. This has sparked a debate about the causes of the increase in murders, with some suggesting that the city's political culture, which reflexively attacks police and brands them as racists, may be a contributing factor.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Urge President Trump to Tone Down Criticism of Congress to Boost GOP Turnout in Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avoid dampening enthusiasm among the Republican base ahead of the midterm elections, Senate Republicans are urging President Donald Trump to stop taking jabs at Congress over its inability to get things done.\n\nTrump, who is known for touting results and criticizing lawmakers when they do not move fast enough on his priorities, has been vocal about the Senate's slow pace on approving nominees, passing annual spending bills, and making progress on immigration reform.\n\nLast week, Trump warned Senate Republicans through Twitter that they should get the annual spending bills passed before the August recess, a high bar for a chamber that didn't pass any regular appropriations bills in 2017. He also slammed the Senate's pace on approving nominees as \"the worst in history.\"\n\nA few days before that, he dinged Congress for a lack of progress on immigration reform, tweeting, \"We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws.\"\n\nEarlier this month, he poked GOP lawmakers for not being more vocally critical of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, warning, \"Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\"\n\nThis flurry of criticism has some Republicans worried that Trump could hurt turnout for the midterm elections. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said, \"It would be very helpful with our base if rather than suggesting we weren't doing anything, that he acknowledged what we are getting done.\"\n\nRounds said this message was communicated to Trump at a meeting on Capitol Hill this past week. \"I think it was well received by the president,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans say that Trump's complaints about the lack of accomplishments in Congress, such as the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, have overshadowed accomplishments, such as passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said he has gotten so many questions and complaints about the ObamaCare failure that he has printed out cards that he hands to constituents that list all the accomplishments of the 115th Congress. They include tax reform, confirming 21 circuit court judges, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate, and using the Congressional Review Act to repeal 14 Obama-era federal regulations.\n\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) gave Trump one of those cards during his meeting with the GOP conference. Alexander told Trump that Republicans' chances of keeping control of the Senate and House after November will depend on him rallying the base.\n\nThat means touting its accomplishments, not panning it for the backlog of executive and judicial branch nominations or stalemate on immigration. \"He has the biggest megaphone and the more he talks about that, the better off we think we are,\" Alexander said.\n\nRepublicans have a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and hope to expand it as Democrats must defend 26 seats in November while Republicans have to worry about only nine. But Democrats have hopes of seizing the majority because the president's party tends to fare badly in the first midterm election, and polls show them leading Republicans by an average of 5 points on the generic ballot.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned on Thursday that control of the chamber is \"absolutely\" up for grabs. GOP strategists think Senate Republicans are right to ask Trump to be more positive.\n\n\"One, Trump has great clout with the Republican base. Two, hammering Republicans [in Congress] undermines their central argument in the midterm election, which is, 'the president needs reinforcements\u2014look at the great results, he needs more Republicans not Democrats,'\" said Republican strategist Ford O'Connell.\n\nGallup reported it reached an 11-month high at the end of April, with 42 percent of respondents nationwide saying they liked the job Trump was doing. A CNN poll released earlier this month found his job approval rating at 41 percent, with 53 percent disapproving.\n\nWhile more people disapprove than approve of Trump's job performance, he's doing significantly better in the public's opinion than Congress. A Gallup poll conducted earlier this month showed Congress with a 17 percent job approval rating.\n\nStrategists say Trump will be key to turning out Republican voters in November. \"The megaphone that President Trump has to fire up the base and get them to vote on election day is crucial for Republicans to win,\" said Ron Bonjean, a strategist and former Senate GOP leadership aide.\n\nHe noted that Republicans held onto the Senate majority in 2016, despite predictions that Democrats would win back control, because of Trump's ability to motivate voters. Senate GOP candidates hung on to win in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin thanks in part to Trump's victory in states where Hillary Clinton was expected to prevail.\n\nBonjean said Republicans \"were activated during the presidential election, and it's just as important to get them motivated to support members of Congress\" in the midterm.",
    " Title: Clarification on EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's Travel Expenses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent controversy surrounding Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's use of private jets for official business, there has been a growing debate about the travel practices of other senior Trump administration officials, particularly Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to distinguish between the two cases, as the specifics of their travel arrangements are distinct.\n\nIn the case of Secretary DeVos, she pays for her work-related travel out of her own pocket, a practice that is ethically acceptable and should not be misconstrued as inappropriate.\n\nAs for Administrator Pruitt, a source has revealed that he took four non-commercial flights in total. The only charter flight was between Denver, Colorado, and Durango, which was arranged after a commercial flight on United Airlines was delayed for eight hours, preventing him from attending an event. The EPA administrator also requested to jump on the governor of Colorado's plane, but was initially denied due to lack of space. After chartering the aircraft, the governor offered a seat, but it would not have been sufficient for Pruitt's staff.\n\nThe other flights were government or military flights. One was a military flight from Cincinnati to JFK so Pruitt could attend the G7 Summit in Italy. This was cleared by the EPA office of ethics.\n\nIn this context, the Administrator's travel practices are not comparable to that of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, as the charter flight in question was a last-minute booking due to a lengthy commercial airline delay.\n\nIt is essential to approach these issues with a nuanced understanding, recognizing that each case has its unique circumstances. Public officials utilizing government or military planes for official business is a common and bipartisan practice. Therefore, the ongoing debate about Administrator Pruitt's travel expenses may be considered a non-story, given the clarification provided.",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Military Parade, Cites High Cost Estimate; Washington Mayor Disputes Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has canceled a proposed military parade, citing a high cost estimate from the Washington, D.C., government. However, Washington officials disputed Trump's claim, stating that the actual cost was closer to the administration's initial estimate.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said via Twitter that the District's cost estimate was $21.6 million, which is near the administration's $12 million projection from February. On Thursday, Pentagon officials told CNN the actual costs would be $92 million, or $80 million more than the original estimate.\n\n\"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it,\" Trump tweeted. \"When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!\"\n\nTrump also announced he would attend a smaller parade already scheduled for Joint Base Andrews, as well as a Nov. 11 parade in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\"Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN,\" Trump tweeted. \"Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\"\n\nBowser said the proposed parade carried significant concerns for taxpayers, and she mocked Trump for his complaints.\n\n\"Yup, I\u2019m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington DC, the local politician who finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities ( $21.6M ) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad),\" she said in a sub-tweet.\n\nJohn J. Falcicchio, chief of staff to Bowser, took issue with Trump's claim that the city is \"poorly\" run, calling it \"fake news.\" He cited a newly earned AAA bond rating.\n\n\"When they go low, we go high... Like our bond rating,\" Falcicchio said in sub-tweeting Trump.\n\nTrump's attendance at a Paris military parade last year inspired him to call for an American version. U.S. officials on Thursday cited expenses for aircraft, equipment, personnel, and security, not charges from the Washington, D.C., government as claimed by Trump.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said \"the Department of Defense and White House have been planning a parade to honor America's military veterans and commemorate the centennial of World War I. We originally targeted November 10, 2018, for this event but have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019.\"\n\n\"The parade money would be better spent fully funding the Department of Veterans Affairs and giving our troops and their families the best care possible,\" the American Legion said.",
    " Title: Missouri Senate Race: McCaskill's Vote Against Kavanaugh Confirmation May Not Affect Re-Election Odds, Poll Shows\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tight re-election race for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill's vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation appears not to have significantly impacted her chances, according to a new poll.\n\nThe poll, conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics, released on Wednesday, found that 44 percent of likely Missouri voters support McCaskill in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, while 45 percent back her Republican challenger, Josh Hawley. The poll had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.\n\nThe Missouri race is considered a toss-up, and Democrats need to gain two seats to win control of the U.S. Senate. Achieving this will require successfully defending Democratic seats in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016, which include Missouri, West Virginia, and Indiana.\n\nMcCaskill joined all but one of her Democratic colleagues in voting against Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by a 50-48 vote after being accused of sexual assault while he was a teenager. The confirmation process became a political brawl that deepened the country's divisions.\n\nHawley, the Republican challenger, had been pressuring McCaskill to support Kavanaugh and criticized her in campaign ads as a \"radical.\" The poll showed that McCaskill, who is seeking her third Senate term, may not be penalized much for her no vote on Kavanaugh. Among likely voters, 44 percent said they were \"more likely\" to support her candidacy because of her opposition to Kavanaugh, while 46 percent said they were \"less likely.\"\n\n\"Kavanaugh may not have changed any minds\" in the state, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the Center for Politics. \"People who said they were more likely to vote for her because of him were probably going to do so anyway.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rank highly among likely voters' priorities in the state. Respondents were much more likely to cite healthcare, the economy, or immigration as top issues for them when deciding which candidate to support.\n\nAlmost no one listed the Supreme Court as the most important issue. Sixty-nine percent of likely voters in the state told the poll they were \"very motivated\" to support a candidate who would \"defend laws that protect healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nThis could spell trouble for Hawley, who has said he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions, even though he joined a multi-state effort to repeal the federal law that does so, the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nA separate \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll found Illinois Democratic gubernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker holding a 20-percentage-point lead over Republican incumbent Bruce Rauner. The race is on track to be the most expensive governor's election in U.S. history, with nearly $249.7 million raised so far, most of the money coming from millionaire Rauner and billionaire Pritzker, according to data from the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.\n\nThe Missouri and Illinois polls were conducted online, in English, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 7. They surveyed between 968 and 1,111 likely voters and weighted the responses according to the latest government population estimates. The results measured how voters felt at the time of the survey. Those feelings may change, as one in eight Americans decided on the presidential pick in the week before Election Day, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll.",
    " Title: The Eroding Shared Language in U.S. Politics: A Threat to National Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of politics, the use of language has become a contentious battleground, with words and phrases often serving as weapons rather than tools for communication. This erosion of shared language is a significant factor contributing to the growing divide in the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump ignited a debate with his use of the term \"lynching\" in reference to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Trump's tweet, which compared the impeachment process to a \"lynching,\" sparked a firestorm of criticism. Among the denunciations was one from former Vice President Joe Biden, who stated, \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Biden himself used the same language in October 1998, during the Clinton impeachment, stating, \"History is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching.\" This prompted Biden to later condemn himself, acknowledging that the word \"lynching\" was not the appropriate term to use.\n\nThe use of language in politics has become a minefield, with every word and phrase scrutinized for signs of malign intent. This politically correct language policing, coupled with the deliberate confusion surrounding gender pronouns, is further exacerbating the divide in the country.\n\nThe ongoing debate over gender pronouns is a prime example of this phenomenon. It is not malicious to suggest that gender pronouns refer to objective measures of sex, but it is considered delusional to insist that third-party use of gender pronouns must refer to subjective self-identification.\n\nThe refusal to define terms is a powerful tool for impugning others, and if the goal is division rather than unity, it will be found. As we increasingly interpret language in separate ways, we become less and less likely to find common ground.\n\nBen Shapiro, a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show,\" and editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com, is one of the many voices in the ongoing conversation about the erosion of shared language in politics. Shapiro, the author of the New York Times bestseller \"The Right Side Of History,\" resides in Los Angeles with his wife and two children.\n\nIn the face of this growing divide, it is crucial that we, as a nation, strive for clarity, understanding, and a return to a shared language that fosters unity rather than division.",
    " Title: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges White House Moved President Trump's Ukraine Call Records to Separate System, Amid Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently declassified whistleblower complaint, which centered on President Donald Trump's request to Ukraine's government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, also alleges that White House officials moved some of Trump's communications with foreign leaders onto a separate computer network.\n\nThe Washington Post initially reported this development, and it has now been corroborated with the release of the whistleblower complaint. The complaint alleged that the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was placed on a computer system directly managed by the National Security Council Directorate for Intelligence Programs.\n\nThe whistleblower, in the complaint, cited officials with whom they spoke, stating that this was not the first instance of a presidential transcript being placed into the system for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive, rather than national security sensitive, information.\n\nThe complaint, in broader terms, alleges that Trump is using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the U.S. election.\n\nTrump defended his July phone call with Ukraine's president, stating that there was \"no pressure\" on him, as a summary showed Trump urging his counterpart to open a probe related to Biden.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nIn response to the complaint's allegations, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, \"Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2014 all of which show nothing improper. The president took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelensky, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself. That is because he has nothing to hide. The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the mainstream media, and President Trump will continue to work hard on behalf of the American people as he always does.\"\n\nAdditional reading: Acting intelligence chief says whistleblower did 'right thing' with Trump complaint, Here's what's happening next in Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump.",
    " Title: Bridging the Political Divide: A Grassroots Movement Emerges for National Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the United States, a quiet yet significant movement is taking shape, aiming not to erase differences but to soften the bitter edge of the political divide. This movement, which seeks to foster understanding and cooperation across the political spectrum, has been growing steadily, with numerous grassroots organizations popping up in towns and cities nationwide.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016, Arlie Russell Hochschild, an American sociologist and author, embarked on a journey across America's political divide, living in liberal Berkeley, California, and immersing herself in a deeply conservative town, Lake Charles, Louisiana, a center of the petrochemical industry. Her account of this journey is chronicled in her 2016 book, \"Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right.\"\n\nHochschild's research revealed a formidable chasm between Republicans and Democrats, as evidenced by a recent Pew survey. The survey found that 71% of Democrats believe the government should do more to help the needy, while only 24% of Republicans agree. Similarly, 64% of Democrats think discrimination is the main reason blacks can't get ahead, while only 14% of Republicans do. The average gap between Democrats and Republicans on ten subjects has grown from 15% in 1994 to 36% in 2017.\n\nDespite these stark differences, Hochschild's research also uncovered potential for common ground. In her book, she recounts her interactions with Trump supporters who, a year after the election, remained committed to the president, albeit with some reservations. Some expressed frustration with Trump's tweeting habits and yearned for a more presidential demeanor, while others defended him, viewing his comments about African and immigrant populations as honest reflections of their own beliefs.\n\nHowever, the movement for unity is not confined to Hochschild's research. Across the country, individuals and groups are reaching out to bridge the divide. Emails from readers have led to connections between Episcopalian congregations in Massachusetts and Louisiana, and dairy farmers in Kansas and California have expressed a desire to host high school students from the opposite coast.\n\nIn one instance, a Trump supporter profiled in Hochschild's book visited Berkeley, California, for a cross-partisan \"Living-room Conversation\" with the author's family. The goal was to find common ground on environmental issues, and while no breakthrough moments were recorded, all participants felt glad they had tried.\n\nFurthermore, Hochschild found potential for coalition on specific issues, such as safeguarding children online, reducing prison populations for non-violent offenders, and protecting against the commercialization of the human genome, among others. Even many of her Louisiana Trump supporters expressed a desire to mend the social infrastructure.\n\nThe Bridge Alliance, a non-profit, non-partisan umbrella group, lists over seventy cross-partisan organizations on its website. These groups, with names like Common Good, Better Angels, American Public Square, and AllSides, aim to restore respect and explore potential points of agreement in their local communities.\n\nExperts estimate that over one in ten people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary ended up voting for Trump in the presidential election. Similarly, it is estimated that between 6.7 and 9.2 million people who voted for Trump in 2016 had also voted for Obama in 2012.\n\nAs of October 2017, the Bridge Alliance had three million supporters. As the nation heads into the next three years with a divided media and a president who speaks to one base, more of us need to reach out to people we disagree with. The movement for unity suggests that we may not be as polarized as we think, and even\u2014or really, especially\u2014if we are, we need to restore the spirit of the public square.\n\nIn the past, the United States had ways of bringing together Americans who differed: the compulsory draft, labor unions, public schools and libraries, and nightly TV news programs like The Huntley-Brinkley Report. Today, we lack these means of sharing each other's worlds. As a result, we need to strengthen the old ways or reinvent new ones\u2014perhaps more Living Room Conversations among some of those Bernie-Obama-Trump crossovers. By itself, the simple act of crossing the partisan divide will not resolve our crisis. But it could help us slowly rebuild a nation in which we feel as if we know each other again.",
    " Title: New Wave of Experimental Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease and CAR-T Treatments Gain Momentum, Attracting Investor Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of medical advancements, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of two new treatments for sickle cell disease in November has rekindled interest in a therapeutic area that has historically lacked successes. This renewed focus is evident in the recent clinical data presented at the American Society of Hematology's (ASH) annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\nNovartis' Adakveo and Global Blood Therapeutics' Oxbryta, both priced around $10,000 per month, are the latest additions to the market. Adakveo reduces the frequency of one of the disease's complications, while Oxbryta targets the root cause of sickle cell anemia.\n\nHowever, the spotlight is also on Bluebird Bio's investigational gene therapy for sickle cell disease. Analysts are optimistic about the therapy, LentiGlobin, following positive data in a Phase 1/2 study. The therapy showed a reduction in vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, two complications of sickle cell disease, in some patients.\n\nBluebird Bio, which also presented data on its experimental CAR-T therapy and LentiGlobin as a treatment for severe beta-thalassemia at ASH, saw its shares rise by 10% in afternoon trading on Tuesday. The company plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial next year.\n\nThe CAR-T therapy field, which gained momentum with the FDA's approval of Novartis' Kymriah in 2017 for certain patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is now becoming increasingly crowded with both large and small pharmaceutical companies. This week, Bluebird and Bristol-Myers Squibb shared results from their early-stage trial for an experimental CAR-T therapy treating multiple myeloma. BMS also announced that a pivotal trial for liso-cel, its investigational CAR-T treatment, showed high rates of durable responses, and it will submit an application to the FDA this month. Johnson & Johnson is also developing a CAR-T for multiple myeloma.\n\nThe high costs associated with CAR-T treatment, with Kymriah launching at $475,000 and Yescarta at $373,000, are a significant factor. However, some experimental therapies are aiming to capitalize on cost-effectiveness by treating patients in an outpatient setting, as opposed to hospitalization, which is more expensive.\n\nIn other news, Merck's $2.7 billion buyout of ArQule, a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for cancer and rare diseases, is the headlining deal in hematology at the moment. The deal, announced on Monday, adds ArQule's mid-stage therapeutic candidate, ARG 531, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, to Merck's high-performing oncology portfolio. Shares of ArQule were up 1.27% in afternoon trading on Tuesday.\n\nThis article aims to provide a neutral, factual, and informative account of the current state of sickle cell disease treatments and CAR-T therapies, highlighting the latest developments and investments in the field.",
    " Title: Superdelegate Advantage for Hillary Clinton in Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing primary race for the Democratic Party nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in a tight battle. However, the superdelegate count, a group of party insiders, shows a different story. According to the latest Associated Press survey of superdelegates, Clinton has the support of 449 out of 712 superdelegates, or about 63 percent, while Sanders has only 19.\n\nExcluding superdelegates, Sanders leads Clinton by 36-32 among delegates based on the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire. This superdelegate advantage is not only a significant lead for Clinton but also a substantial gain since the AP's November survey, with her total increasing by 90 delegates, while Sanders has risen by 11.\n\nIt is important to note that Clinton also had a substantial superdelegate lead during her previous presidential campaign in 2008, but ultimately lost the nomination. As of January 2008, she maintained a significant lead of 201 to Barack Obama's 89 and John Edwards' 40, according to the AP.\n\nIn February 2008, Obama began to quickly pick up superdelegates, while Clinton started to lose some to his side. This time around, Clinton is maintaining strong support among the party's \"establishment\" thus far, despite the tight race in some primaries and caucuses.\n\nSuperdelegates consist of well-known figures such as members of Congress and former presidents, as well as party insiders like state party leaders and Democratic National Committee members. While non-superdelegates are allocated based on how people vote in the various state caucuses and primaries, superdelegates are \"unbound,\" meaning they can choose whom they want. And so far, they have overwhelmingly chosen Clinton.\n\nThis can lead to delegate counts that may not align with the vote totals. In New Hampshire, where Sanders won the primary by a 22-point margin, both he and Clinton have 15 total delegates. While he won 15 of the state's 24 non-superdelegates, she has six of the eight superdelegates in her corner.\n\nSome Sanders supporters, upset about this system, have taken to contacting superdelegates. A MoveOn.org petition, which currently has over 161,000 signatures, declares that \"the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes, and not who has the most support from party insiders.\" The petition asks superdelegates to \"pledge to back the will of the voters.\"\n\nThe superdelegate system, which gives the party outsize influence, is a point of contention for many Sanders supporters. However, the system was created in 1982 to \"improve the party's mainstream appeal\" by giving party insiders more influence and reducing that of \"activists,\" as Brookings Institution's Thomas Mann and AEI's Norman Ornstein wrote in 2008.\n\nThe superdelegate system is intended to provide a \"peer review\" to choose the most electable candidate and promote a sense of unity, making \"stronger ties between the party and its elected officials.\" In a tight race, this \"unity\" argument may be hard to see from a voter's perspective.\n\nMany superdelegates have to be re-elected at some point, and going too sharply against voters' wishes is not beneficial in that sense. However, superdelegates remain unbound, even if they've chosen a candidate already. Should the race swing heavily in Sanders' favor, some superdelegates who are currently backing Clinton could always switch their support.",
    " Title: President Trump Affirms Support for National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster Amid Controversy Over Classified Information Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to quell mounting speculation and controversy, President Donald Trump issued a statement of support for his National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, on Friday. The statement came in response to a letter McMaster sent to his Obama-era predecessor, Susan Rice, granting her continued access to classified information.\n\nMcMaster's letter, which supporters claim was a routine procedure, was leaked to suggest that the Army Lieutenant General was aiding Trump's adversaries. The letter's disclosure has added fuel to the well-documented feud between McMaster and powerful factions within the White House. A recent series of dismissals by McMaster seems to have intensified the internal tensions.\n\nHowever, Trump's statement affirmed, \"General McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country.\"\n\nMcMaster has been under scrutiny due to a series of dismissals he has ordered within the National Security Council (NSC). The most recent dismissal was that of Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the NSC, who was viewed as a Trump loyalist.\n\nThursday's report by Circa News suggested that McMaster sent a letter granting Rice access to classified material, weeks after her alleged role in 'unmasking' identities of Trump associates in intelligence reports was disclosed. However, sources from the NSC stated that the letter was a standard procedure, similar to those sent to every living former national security adviser and former president.\n\nThe NSC also clarified that extending Rice's security clearance does not grant her access to classified information; it merely allows her to be called back in (if necessary) to discuss classified information.\n\nThe fact that McMaster sent the letter to Rice, given the ongoing controversy surrounding her and the 'unmasking' of members of the Trump campaign, transition, and administration in intelligence documents, has not been favorably received by administration members who are not particularly fond of McMaster.\n\nCohen-Watnick, who was brought into the NSC by former national security adviser Mike Flynn, was at the center of the controversy over House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes' visit to the White House in March to review intelligence reports about incidental surveillance of Trump officials during the presidential campaign.\n\nFurthermore, it was revealed on Wednesday that Rich Higgins, who served as director for strategic planning at the NSC, was fired on July 21. Higgins was an ally of senior White House adviser Steve Bannon. Additionally, Derek Harvey, a top Middle East adviser, was also relieved of his duties last week.\n\nThe personnel changes at the NSC coincide with a series of high-profile staff changes within the White House, including the resignation of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, and the brief tenure of Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci.",
    " Title: Pelosi's Rising Popularity and Shutdown Strategy: A Turning Point in Her Career\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 33-day government shutdown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been a formidable adversary to President Donald Trump. She has rejected his proposals for reopening the government, citing his insistence on $5.7 billion for the border wall as \"an immorality.\" Pelosi has also pressured Trump to postpone the State of the Union address, scheduled for next Tuesday, over shutdown-related security concerns, potentially forcing him to hold the event elsewhere.\n\nNew polling shows that Pelosi's popularity has surged. According to polling from Civiqs, Pelosi's favorability among Democrats has jumped 13 points, from 59 to 72 percent. Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California, Riverside, argues, \"It appears that Pelosi's opposition to the president has rallied her party's base and increased her favorability ratings.\"\n\nThis trend is not limited to Democrats. A CBS News poll released on Wednesday indicates that more Americans want Trump to give up wall funding than prefer the congressional Democrats to agree to wall funding. Moreover, more Americans feel Pelosi is handling negotiations better than the president.\n\nThe shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, could inflict lasting damage on Trump's presidency. If so, Pelosi's recent performance could mark a high point in her career. She has demonstrated resilience in the face of opposition, having thwarted George W. Bush's plan to privatize Social Security in 2005 and passing Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. However, the current political climate, the nature of the president, and the criticism she has faced over the past year may redefine her historical narrative.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, Pelosi's continued leadership may face scrutiny from progressives, particularly if Democrats win back the presidency and the Senate. She has been cautious in confronting the progressive wing's ambitious agenda, implementing a pay-go rule in the House, advocating for strengthening Obamacare, and allowing hearings on universal health care, but not fully embracing Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Furthermore, she has often favored corporate-friendly centrists like Hakeem Jeffries over progressives like Barbara Lee.\n\nHowever, the 2020 election and Democrats' unified control of the government are still distant prospects. For now, Pelosi is determined to use the shutdown to undermine and weaken Trump's presidency, a strategy that has earned her the loyalty of her entire caucus. As history has shown, winning tends to have that effect.",
    " Title: Escalating Political Tensions: Antifa Protests at Tucker Carlson's Home Signal New Phase in U.S. Political Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling turn of events, a mob of left-wing antifa activists descended upon Fox News personality Tucker Carlson's Washington D.C. home on Wednesday, marking a new phase in the rising political violence and confrontations targeting the news media. This incident, which saw the activists chanting outside Mr. Carlson's residence, is part of a growing trend of aggressive political confrontations that have been escalating since 2012, according to the Global Terrorism Database.\n\nPolitical violence has been on the rise in the United States, with increasingly aggressive activists pushing political confrontation to its limits since 2016. These activists have been known to accost Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials in restaurants and in the halls of Congress. Now, they are targeting conservative journalists at their homes.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night!\" the antifa-allied activists chanted outside Mr. Carlson's home. The Fox News host, whose wife was home alone during the disturbance, expressed his concerns, stating, \"I never thought twice about leaving them home alone, but this is the reaction because this group doesn't like my TV show.\"\n\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is a group with anarchist leanings that targets anyone perceived as not in step with a far-left agenda. The group's actions at Mr. Carlson's home have sparked widespread condemnation, with many viewing it as an unacceptable violation of personal privacy and safety.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the overheated political debate has lawmakers increasingly working under a threat of violence. Capitol police have reported a surge in protective details assigned to lawmakers earlier in the fall, when senators were facing hallway protests during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Security details were assigned to at least two Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nThe threats and confrontations have extended to anyone entering the political arena. California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford is still receiving death threats and has been unable to return to work more than a month after she testified to Congress against Justice Kavanaugh during confirmation hearings. Former IRS official Lois G. Lerner is still getting threats stemming from her role in the tea party targeting scandal of five years ago.\n\nThe threats, confrontations, and violence come from extremists on both the left and the right. Cesar Sayoc, a crazed supporter of President Trump, is charged with sending at least 16 pipe bomb packages to people viewed as enemies of the president, including high-profile Democrats Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and commentators at CNN. Left-wing activist James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a congressional Republican softball practice in June 2017, almost killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\nThe D.C. Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident at Mr. Carlson's home, during which the demonstrators allegedly damaged the front door. Fox News executives have condemned the incident, stating, \"The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with these incidents, scholars of terrorism and political violence are expressing concern. Joseph Young, a scholar of terrorism and political violence at American University, stated, \"We are seeing more violent events recently as there seems to be a retreat from basic democratic norms.\" He added, \"Some extremists do not see the value of dialogue or compromise and are concerned with the speed of change. Most importantly, when core values seem under threat, these individuals are using violence in what they perceive as a defensive action.\"\n\nAs the political climate continues to heat up, it remains to be seen how these incidents will shape the future of political discourse in the United States.",
    " Title: North Carolina Democrats Adopt Strategic Shift Amidst State Party Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of a sexual harassment scandal that rocked the North Carolina Democratic Party, top national and state Democrats are adopting a series of unusual measures to protect their candidates and President Barack Obama's reelection campaign from further damage.\n\nNorth Carolina, already a challenging state for Obama, was further complicated by the revelation in April that the NCDP's then-executive director, Jay Parmley, was accused of misconduct by a young male employee. Parmley subsequently resigned, but Chairman David Parker managed to hold onto his position despite calls for his ouster from top state Democrats and pressure from Washington officials.\n\nThe scandal presents a challenge for the Obama campaign and other Democrats running for office in the state. With Parker's shaky political position and the ongoing harassment flap, national and state Democrats must find ways to navigate around state officials linked to the scandal. The challenge is compounded by the fact that the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Charlotte this summer, an event that was already facing fundraising difficulties.\n\nRather than abandoning the state, Democrats in North Carolina and Washington are working to find ways to work around Parker. The chairman, they say, is currently more focused on shoring up his own political position and reaching out to local activists than taking operational control of the campaign machinery. This leaves room for other national and state Democrats to take charge of the situation and control the purse strings of the 2012 campaign.\n\n\"The Obama campaign appears to be dug in here and committed and working here,\" said veteran North Carolina Democratic strategist Gary Pearce, a former adviser to four-term Governor Jim Hunt. \"The talk here is the Obama campaign and the [Lt. Gov. Walter] Dalton campaign feel pretty confident they can work around [Parker].\"\n\nHowever, Pearce noted, \"The problem is, who's going to trust David Parker with a few million dollars? Well, nobody.\"\n\nDiscussions are underway to set up a coordinated campaign apparatus between national and state Democrats for high-profile state campaigns, such as the governor's race between Dalton and former GOP Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory, and congressional races. To the extent that the state party is involved, it would be one of numerous decision-makers at the table, and campaigns say they expect to be able to work with competent staff members there to maneuver around the mess with Parker.\n\n\"It's going to be focused, it's going to have the resources it needs... Because of what transpired [with the NCDP] I think there's a clear difference in terms of participation and guiding hands,\" said one knowledgeable North Carolina Democratic operative, who characterized Parker's involvement as limited.\n\n\"I think it would be safe to say that David Parker's focused very much on the internal party politics and not the business of messing with these campaigns. The state convention is a big deal... That's right in his wheelhouse,\" the operative said, referring to the North Carolina Democratic convention on June 16. \"I would say his participation in the day-to-day workings of coordinated campaigns, infrastructure, that kind of thing, is diminished.\"",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Prepared to Sue Trump Administration, Subpoena Mueller Over Mueller Report\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff stated that he is prepared to take legal action against the Trump administration and subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if the Mueller report on possible Russia interference in the 2016 presidential campaign is not made public.\n\nDuring the interview, Schiff, a California Democrat, made it clear that he would do whatever necessary to make the findings of the report public. \"We are going to get to the bottom of this,\" he said. \"We are going to share this information with the public.\"\n\nWhen asked by host George Stephanopoulos if he was prepared to take the administration to court if the Mueller report is not released to the public, Schiff responded, \"Absolutely. We are going to get to the bottom of this. We are going to share this information with the public.\"\n\nSchiff also stated that the Mueller report, which is expected to be released soon, should be made public, and that the president should welcome its publication if he is serious about his claims of exoneration. \"If the president is serious about all of his claims of exoneration, then he should welcome the publication of this report,\" Schiff said.\n\nSchiff also emphasized that Mueller has a responsibility to report the findings of the investigation, and that withholding the information from Congress would essentially give the president immunity. \"If you take the position\u2014and I think it's a flawed one\u2014but if you take the position that the president can not be indicted and the only remedy for improper or illegal or other conduct is impeachment, then you can not withhold that information from Congress or essentially the president has immunity,\" Schiff said.\n\nSchiff also stated that Attorney General William Barr would be under \"immeasurable pressure\" to publish the report, and that any attempt to withhold or bury any part of the report would tarnish Barr's legacy. \"If he were to try to withhold, to bury any part of this report, that will be his legacy,\" Schiff said. \"And it will be a tarnished legacy.\"",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus Urges President Trump for Economic Reopening as Small Business Aid Stalemate Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus have called for the reopening of the economy, as businesses across the nation continue to grapple with the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic. In a letter sent to President Donald Trump on Friday, the group of House representatives, including Reps. Andy Biggs, Jody Hice, Ron Wright, Jeff Duncan, Scott Perry, Andy Harris, Scott DesJarlais, Ken Buck, Paul Gosar, Randy Weber, Ted Yoho, Dan Bishop, and Ted Yoho, expressed their concern over the economic hardships faced by the American people.\n\nThe letter, reported by Fox News, emphasized the resilience of the American people but acknowledged the significant strain the closed economy has placed on them. The House Freedom Caucus members argued that the economic woes are not best addressed through increased government intervention, but rather by reopening the economy.\n\nThe letter highlighted the job losses and economic hardships many Americans have faced due to the virus, while acknowledging the efforts made by states to curb the spread of the outbreak. The representatives stated, \"The American people have responded to the guidelines and the effects are apparent...Unfortunately, some of the measures enacted to combat the virus have wreaked havoc on the American economy.\"\n\nThe call for economic reopening comes amid a stalemate in the Senate over small business aid. On April 9, Senate Democrats blocked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's request for an additional $250 billion for small businesses, labeling it a \"political stunt.\" ( RELATED : Senate Democrats Block McConnell's Bid For $250 Billion More In Small Business Aid )\n\nThe Republican bill, if passed, would have provided an additional $250 billion for a loan program for small businesses. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped the bill would pass by unanimous consent, but it was blocked from passing due to Democratic opposition. Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen voiced their opposition on the Senate floor, stating that the immediate needs of small businesses were not being addressed.\n\nAs Congress works on legislation to support small businesses, most members are currently on recess, making it challenging for swift passage of new legislation. The full House and Senate are not expected to return to Washington D.C. before May 4.",
    " Title: Market-Driven Transformation: California's Housing Market Shifts Amid Remote Work Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of California, a significant shift is underway in the real estate market, driven primarily by the rise of remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This transformation, which bypasses the traditional political avenues, is reshaping urban landscapes and addressing, to some extent, the state's long-standing housing shortage.\n\nThe change, however, clashes with the views of politicians like San Francisco's Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who advocates for high-density, high-rise apartment and condominium construction. While the market-based solution aligns with Wiener's vision in terms of high-rise and high-density housing, it diverges in its application, focusing on repurposing existing office spaces rather than constructing new buildings.\n\nWhite-collar businesses, once eager for more office space in areas like Century City in Los Angeles, downtown San Diego, and San Francisco's financial district, are now seeking ways to relinquish their leases. \"For lease\" signs are becoming commonplace in urban areas, as tenants, many of whom have sent their workforces home during the pandemic, refuse to pay rent or negotiate deferred payment plans.\n\nWith companies like Facebook and Twitter encouraging remote work, and others adopting hybrid work-from-home policies, vast amounts of current office space are expected to remain vacant. This vacancy is not a sign of a diminished need for office space, but rather a reduction in the amount required.\n\nThe reopening of California after the initial phase of the pandemic has revealed that a significant number of workers will continue to work from home. In many cases, this is not a matter of preference, but necessity, as state guidelines for reopening public schools necessitate continued virtual commuting.\n\nThis shift in work patterns is reflected in recent housing market trends. Demand for housing is increasing in Marin, Napa, Santa Cruz, and Monterey counties, while decreasing in San Francisco itself. This discrepancy is evident in the case of a house in San Francisco's Sunset District, which was sold for $1.89 million 15 months ago and is now listed on the Zillow real estate site at $1.78 million\u2014a decrease of $101,000.\n\nMeanwhile, realtors in suburban counties are reporting steady demand, with many potential buyers being the same people who previously worked in urban towers but are now working from home. As their employers allow them to continue working remotely, some are seeking more spacious quarters and a less urban environment.\n\nIn essence, many are opting for the urban sprawl that is anathema to Wiener, who has sponsored numerous bills aimed at increasing density in the same areas that are now seeing a mass exodus from dense neighborhoods.\n\nThe next phase of this transformation is expected to see entire floors of high-rise buildings go vacant and remain so for significant periods. Once building owners realize that new lessees will not be forthcoming in large numbers, they will opt for alternative ways to monetize their buildings, such as converting much of the empty floor space to condos and apartments.\n\nThese new dwellings will come in various sizes and price levels, from large ocean-and mountain-view units to small apartments on the lower floors. Some buildings will have mixed use, with stores on the ground floor and other levels shared by offices and dwelling units. Zoning changes are inevitable.\n\nThis market-driven solution is poised to create vast numbers of housing units within the next five years, many of them affordable, addressing the housing shortage in a manner that bypasses the traditional political process.",
    " Title: Human Rights Watch Accuses Ukrainian Government Forces of Using Cluster Munitions in Eastern Ukraine, Allegations Could Complicate Peace Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report released on Monday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has provided evidence suggesting that the Ukrainian government forces fighting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have indiscriminately used cluster munitions, a weapon banned in much of the world. The New York-based watchdog group found signs of cluster munitions attacks in more than 12 locations in eastern Ukraine, where more than 3,700 people have been killed in fighting since April.\n\nThe report details the suspected use of cluster munitions earlier this month in Donetsk, a rebel-held city with a peacetime population of over one million. Cluster bombs are designed to explode before impact and scatter tiny explosives over a large area.\n\n\"It is shocking to see a weapon that most countries have banned used so extensively in eastern Ukraine,\" said Mark Hiznay, senior arms researcher at HRW. \"Ukrainian authorities should make an immediate commitment not to use cluster munitions and join the treaty to ban them.\"\n\nThe watchdog group said that the attacks had killed at least six people and wounded dozens, but the toll could be higher. While it could not conclusively account for each attack, HRW said in its report that \"there is particularly strong evidence that Ukrainian government forces were responsible\" and that their use of the munitions \"may amount to war crimes.\" HRW also noted that rebels may have used the munitions.\n\nA New York Times investigation also found physical evidence\u2014supported by interviews with witnesses and victims\u2014of cluster munitions fired by Ukrainian forces into Donetsk. Two attacks on Oct. 2 and Oct. 6 wounded at least six people and killed a Swiss employee of the International Red Cross, according to the Times.\n\nThe allegations could undermine the fragile cease-fire signed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and pro-Russian rebels in September. It could also jeopardize long-term peace negotiations in the area. As the Times reports, the army's use of cluster munitions, which shower small bomblets around a large area, could add credibility to Moscow's version of the conflict, which is that the Ukrainian national government is engaged in a punitive war against its own citizens.\n\nUkrainian military officials have denied the accusations to reporters, while rebels have not commented. The allegations come as Germany's foreign intelligence agency (BND) found that pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July. The crash killed 298 people. BND President Gerhard Schindler told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that his agency had \"ample\" evidence to implicate the rebels, Der Spiegel reports. He refuted Russian claims that Ukrainian soldiers shot down the plane with a missile. However, the German investigation concluded that the missile launcher used to down the plane was Ukrainian, not Russian. It said rebels had captured the launcher from a Ukrainian base.",
    " Title: Opinion Pieces Stir Controversy Over Electoral College Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, some Democrats are advocating for an unprecedented move to influence the Electoral College vote on Monday, aiming to prevent Donald Trump from assuming the presidency. The idea, while technically a possibility, has sparked controversy and debate among political analysts and journalists.\n\nThe Electoral College, a constitutional body established to elect the President and Vice President of the United States, is expected to follow the results of the popular vote in each state. However, some Democrats are proposing that if they can persuade 37 Republican electors to change their votes, they could potentially deny Trump the presidency.\n\nThis proposal has been met with criticism, with many arguing that it would amount to an unjust and undemocratic act, effectively overturning the will of the majority of voters who elected Trump. E.J. Dionne, a Washington Post columnist, MSNBC contributor, and author, has expressed his skepticism towards this idea, stating that it would be a \"hijacking of democracy.\"\n\nDionne, known for his liberal views, questions the legitimacy of the electoral revolt, stating that Trump's victory was fair and square, despite the 2.8 million vote margin in favor of Hillary Clinton. He argues that if Trump takes office, it will be due to the electoral college system, not the popular vote.\n\nKathleen Parker, a moderate conservative Washington Post columnist and former CNN host, has also weighed in on the issue. She suggests that the Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a safeguard against the election of a demagogue or autocrat, citing Trump as a potential example. Parker argues that the electoral college was designed to prevent individuals who are unfit or dangerous from becoming president.\n\nThe idea of influencing the Electoral College vote has sparked a heated debate, with many questioning the legitimacy and constitutionality of such a move. However, it is important to note that this proposal is unlikely to gain traction, as the electoral college is expected to follow the results of the popular vote in each state.\n\nThis debate, though, sheds light on the ongoing tension and division in the United States, as well as the ongoing debate over the Electoral College system and its role in the democratic process. As the country moves forward, it remains to be seen how this issue will be resolved and whether the Electoral College will continue to play a significant role in the election of future presidents.",
    " Title: Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley Praises Trump's Decision to Strike Iran's Top General, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley praised President Donald Trump for ordering the drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, last week. Haley's comments, however, have sparked criticism for claiming that the only ones outside of the Iranian regime who are upset about his death are Trump's domestic political opponents.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night, Haley said, \"I think the president showed great decisiveness, great resolve.\" The strike that killed Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, occurred on a road near the Baghdad airport on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. blamed Iran for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq by a mob of demonstrators belonging to Shiite militias. The U.S. also said one of those Iran-backed militias was responsible for a rocket attack that killed an American contractor and at least two dozen of its fighters in airstrikes at the end of December.\n\nHaley stated, \"What the president did left the Iranian regime completely flat-footed. They did not see this coming. They thought they could continue to do their multiple strikes. But when it got to the lives of Americans, the president is never going to allow that to happen.\"\n\nSoleimani led Iran's involvement in proxy wars in the Muslim world, including the civil wars in Syria and Yemen. He supported militias throughout the Middle East that are loyal to Tehran. And he oversaw the training of Shiite Iraqi militants to kill U.S. troops, teaching them how to make deadly roadside bombs.\n\nThe U.S. estimates that Soleimani and the Iran Revolutionary Guard were responsible for killing more than 600 American service members in Iraq following the 2003 invasion.\n\nHaley described Soleimani's killing as \"a long time coming\" and said it left Iran's leaders \"shaking in their boots.\" She said, \"You do not see anyone standing up for Iran. You're not hearing any of the Gulf members. You're not hearing China. You're not hearing Russia.\"\n\nHaley's unsubstantiated claim that only Democrats are mourning Soleimani's death was slammed as irresponsible by several commentators. Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said, \"This kind of statement is ridiculous, inflammatory, and dangerous. Rather than inform viewers, Ambassador Haley wants to divide Americans.\"\n\nDemocrats have questioned the wisdom of killing Soleimani and whether the Trump administration fully considered the potential consequences before taking action. However, many have stressed that Soleimani was responsible for thousands of deaths and that they were not sad to see him go.\n\nThe escalating situation with Iran continues to unfold, with Iran's parliament approving a bill calling the U.S. military and the Pentagon terrorists after Soleimani's killing. A stampede at Soleimani's funeral on Tuesday killed at least 40 people.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said, \"No American will mourn Qassem Soleimani\u2019s passing,\" adding, \"He deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Soleimani was a \"murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans,\" but she said the decision to kill him was a \"reckless move\" that \"escalates the situation with Iran.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has introduced a resolution requiring congressional approval for further military action against Iran, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House would vote on a similar resolution this week.\n\nDemocrats have also called on the administration to brief more members of Congress on the intelligence it says showed Soleimani was planning upcoming attacks on Americans and that he presented an \"imminent threat.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" during an interview Sunday, \"I accept the notion that there was a real threat,\" but added, \"The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that it was \"accurate\" to say Soleimani was plotting against American interests. However, Schiff also questioned whether the plotting rose to the level that required Soleimani's elimination from the battlefield.\n\nHaley's claim that Democrats are mourning Soleimani's death has been met with criticism and ridicule on social media. Several public figures, including 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, have called Haley's statement dishonest and irresponsible.\n\n\"Shameful, dangerous comment,\" Williamson tweeted. \"We're in trouble as a nation when an ex-Governor and UN Ambassador would say something so dishonest.\"\n\n\"Nikki Haley. I've rarely agreed with your politics but I've always before respected you as a person. It demeans everyone when politicians go low,\" Williamson added.\n\n\"Just knock it off,\" tweeted David Frum, an ex-speechwriter for former President George W. Bush. He included a link to an October 2015 CNN article about then-presidential candidate Trump saying the world would have been better off if dictators Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi were still in power in Iraq and Libya.\n\n\"This is categorically false. The former Governor of South Carolina, former Ambassador to the United Nations & current member of the board of directors of Boeing Corporation \u2013 on television saying something she absolutely knows is untrue,\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle said.\n\n\"Here's a question: What WON'T Nikki Haley say at this point?\" asked New York Daily News sports columnist Mike Lupica.",
    " Title: Media's Role in the Rise of Donald Trump: A Neutral Analysis of Politico's Special Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's significant gains in the Republican primaries, a wave of introspection and criticism towards the media has emerged, with some arguing that the press has played a significant role in Trump's rise. This perspective is vividly portrayed in Politico Magazine's recent special issue, titled \"What Have We Done?\"\n\nThe issue, packed with essays critical of Trump, has sparked a debate about the media's role in the political landscape. One essay, penned by media writer Jack Shafer, argues that the blame game \"gives too much credit to the media and too little credit to Donald Trump.\"\n\nHowever, the issue does not lack voices advocating for media accountability. Former CNN and NBC anchor Campbell Brown, in her piece \"Why I Blame TV for Trump,\" asserts that television news has given Trump \"editorial control\" and rolled over for The Donald, driven by a hunger for ratings.\n\nBrown's argument is that Trump's candidacy is a creation of a TV media that wants him or needs him to be the central character in this year's political drama. She points out that TV anchors and senior executives who don't deliver ratings are mercilessly ousted, while those who do are lavishly rewarded.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider other factors that have contributed to Trump's success. Trump has seized much of the \"free\" airtime by doing many more interviews than his rivals and by driving the campaign dialogue. Reporters have dug deep into Trump's businesses, rhetoric, promises, and contradictions, but these stories and segments have done little to dent his lead.\n\nMoreover, a significant portion of the media attention lavished on Trump is harshly negative, often from conservative and liberal commentators who oppose him on ideological grounds. Trump punches back hard, especially on Twitter, though he's toned it down of late. The billionaire actually benefits from denunciations by those his supporters view as members of a failed media/political establishment.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is much to criticize in the media's coverage of Donald Trump, it is reductive to say the media were the engine that powered his candidacy. Trump's success is a complex interplay of factors, including his unique appeal to voters, his media savvy, and the media's role in amplifying his message.

The announcement brings forward the controversial plan, initially announced by President Trump in December, by at least a year.\n\nThe decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv, where all other embassies are located, has been a contentious issue, with Palestinian officials expressing concern. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, called the move a \"blatant provocation.\"\n\nThe anniversary of Israel's founding precedes by a day what Palestinians call the Nakba, or \"catastrophe\" of their displacement in the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the embassy announcement as \"a great day for the people of Israel.\"\n\nPresident Trump's decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the embassy infuriated Palestinians. The declaration broke with decades of US neutrality on the issue and put the US out of step with the rest of the international community.\n\nThe US Department of State spokeswoman said the embassy would initially be located at existing consular facilities in the Arnona district of the city. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its \"eternal and undivided\" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a future state.\n\nJerusalem contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam, and Christianity - and Israeli sovereignty over the city has never been recognized internationally. Within days of President Trump's declaration, a UN resolution was passed declaring any decisions regarding the status of the city \"null and void\" and insisting on its cancellation. It was backed by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine voting against.\n\nLast month, US Vice-President Mike Pence told the Israeli parliament that the move would occur sometime before the end of 2019. The sudden change to this May has been seen by some as a deliberate snub to Palestinians. Mr. Erekat said the US move \"reflects their total insensitivities to what goes on in this region.\" He added, \"The US administration has become part of the problem and not part of the solution.\"\n\nHowever, the move was welcomed by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who said, \"This decision will turn Israel's 70th Independence Day into an even bigger celebration.\" He thanked President Trump for his leadership and friendship. The US Department of State has not yet provided further details about the embassy's opening ceremony.",
    " Title: Congressional Hearing Tangles as Mueller Report Length Revealed, Trump and Schiff Exchange Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - A contentious congressional hearing on Thursday saw a clash between President Donald Trump's Republican allies and one of Trump's most prominent Democratic critics, Representative Adam Schiff, as the U.S. Attorney General revealed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report is over 300 pages long.\n\nThe hearing, titled \"Putin's Playbook: The Kremlin's Use of Oligarchs, Money, and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond,\" took a tumultuous turn hours after Trump called for Schiff's resignation from Congress on Twitter due to his comments about the president's 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nIn response, Republican lawmakers called for Schiff to step down as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his comments about the president's associates and their actions during the 2016 election. Schiff, however, countered the accusations, labeling the actions of Trump and committee Republicans as \"shameful\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, defended Schiff, stating that the actions of Trump and committee Republicans were \"shameful\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr, who was empowered by Justice Department regulations to decide how much of the special counsel's report to make public, on Sunday released a four-page summary of Mueller's findings. Barr stated that Mueller did not establish that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barr informed House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler about the length of the report, and agreed to testify before Nadler's committee, although no date was set.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate thwarted another effort by Democrats to pass a resolution calling for the Mueller report to be made available to the public and Congress. The House has passed a similar resolution.\n\nA Justice Department official stated on Tuesday that Barr would issue a public version of the report within \"weeks, not months.\" However, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Barr's delay in the release has \"too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump.\"\n\nPelosi also demanded the report's release, stating, \"No, thank you, Mr. Attorney General. We do not need your interpretation. Show us the report, and we'll come to our own conclusions.\"\n\nRepublicans have since launched a counter-attack against Democrats since Barr released his summary. Trump used an early-morning Twitter post to assail Schiff, whose committee is investigating Russia's influence on U.S. elections.\n\nTrump did not provide specifics of his accusations against Schiff, who has not been accused by authorities of leaking classified information.\n\nRepublican members of the intelligence panel opened a Thursday session on Russian meddling with an attack on Schiff. They said all nine Republican panel members had signed a letter asking him to quit.\n\nSchiff responded by citing a list of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians, from Donald Trump Jr. welcoming a Russian offer of \"dirt\" on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, to former national security adviser Michael Flynn secretly discussing easing U.S. sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador before Trump became president.\n\n\"You might say that's all OK,\" Schiff said. \"You might say that's just what you need to do to win. But I don't think it's OK. I think it's immoral. I think it's unethical. I think it's unpatriotic and, yes, I think it's corrupt - and evidence of collusion.\"\n\nDuring his investigation, Mueller brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former Trump aides. Mueller left unresolved in his report the question of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by impeding the Russia investigation and did not exonerate the president, Barr said. Barr himself concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish that Trump had committed obstruction of justice.\n\n\"They're afraid of the truth. They're afraid of competence,\" Pelosi told her weekly news conference. \"I'm so proud of the work of Chairman Adam Schiff.\"\n\nThe House intelligence committee has been bitterly split along party lines for years on the Russia investigation, which was taken over by Mueller in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe committee's Republicans wrapped up their investigation a year ago, finding no collusion between Trump and Moscow to influence the vote. Democrats, led by Schiff, blasted the announcement as premature.\n\nThursday's hearing, examining the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's wealthiest business leaders, known as oligarchs, continued after the angry exchange between its members.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, harm Clinton, and boost Trump's candidacy. Russia denied election interference.",
    " Title: Career Diplomat William Taylor's Testimony in Impeachment Inquiry: A Detailed Account of Alleged Quid Pro Quo\n\nAmbassador Bill Taylor, a career diplomat who has served as the US envoy to Ukraine since June, testified before Congress that President Trump made the release of military aid to Ukraine conditional on a pledge that a political rival would be investigated.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Taylor stated that President Trump wanted Ukraine to probe former Vice-President Joe Biden's dealings and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. He described the relationship with Ukraine as being \"fundamentally undermined\" due to an \"irregular, informal channel of US policy-making\" and the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.\n\nThe \"irregular\" channel included US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. By mid-July, Mr. Taylor said, it was apparent that a meeting President Zelensky wanted with Mr. Trump was conditioned on the investigation of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US elections.\n\nMr. Taylor's remarks appear to contradict Mr. Sondland's earlier statement before lawmakers, where he said he had had \"no discussions\" with state department or White House officials regarding the investigating the Bidens. Text messages showed Bill Taylor had issues with the way the White House was conducting its foreign policy toward Ukraine.\n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Taylor corroborated other reported accounts of White House efforts to get Ukraine to open investigations that could be damaging to Democrats, and Vice-President Joe Biden in particular. He added new perspective, particularly in a conversation he had with Gordon Sondland, where Mr. Sondland told him \"everything\" was dependent on the Ukrainian president making a public statement that he would order these investigations.\n\nMr. Taylor's testimony would be hard to dismiss as inaccurate, given his career as a diplomat and his noted military background. Ex-Bush aide Nicholas Burns called him a \"person of integrity\" and \"a true patriot.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives is currently investigating allegations of wrongdoing by the president, with Democrats accusing him of illegally pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival. If the House finds sufficient evidence, articles of impeachment will be put to a vote. If they are approved, proceedings will move to trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Mr. Trump's Republicans.\n\nDemocratic congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described Mr. Taylor's appearance as \"the most damning testimony I've heard.\" \"He drew a very specific direct line from President Trump to the withholding of foreign aid and the refusal of a [presidential] meeting,\" she said. Fellow Democrats echoed this idea and praised Mr. Taylor's \"meticulous\" note-taking.\n\nThe debate about whether Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense continues, with the president himself saying he has done nothing wrong. If the House finds sufficient evidence, articles of impeachment will be put to a vote. If they are approved, proceedings will move to trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Mr. Trump's Republicans.",
    " Title: California and New York Experiment with Hotel Housing for Homeless, Including Those Released from Jail Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, two hotels near Oakland International Airport in California are providing temporary housing for homeless individuals, including those released from jail under emergency orders. This initiative is part of an experiment to limit the spread of the virus in both overcrowded jails and sprawling homeless encampments.\n\nCalifornia and New York appear to be the first states to implement such a measure. Sgt. Ray Kelly, the spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, which includes Oakland, stated, \"We are doing things that we've never done before. The reason for the decision is to save lives\u2014there's no doubt about that. We're up against a clock.\"\n\nThe pandemic has forced law enforcement agencies across the country to make difficult decisions to prevent outbreaks in overcrowded jails, where people cycle in and out as they await trial or serve short sentences. Some agencies have released thousands of inmates early. However, when people leave jails, they often face the question of where to go.\n\nIn New York City, the Department of Homeless Services has offered hotel rooms to homeless individuals released from Rikers Island, the city's jail. The need for housing is particularly pressing in California, where the pandemic coincides with a historic homelessness crisis.\n\nAccording to estimates, there are 150,000 homeless Californians, driven to the streets by soaring home prices, a housing shortage, and lack of access to mental health care. Gov. Gavin Newsom devoted his recent State of the State address to the problem, calling it a \"disgrace.\"\n\nIn response, Newsom signed an executive order that includes $50 million to lease hotel rooms or buy travel trailers for homeless individuals, including those released from jails. As of Friday, the state had secured 7,000 hotel rooms.\n\nOakland is among the first localities in California to implement this housing solution, according to the governor's office. County officials did not release a count of how many people are in the hotels or how many among them were released from jail.\n\nOther counties throughout the state, including San Diego and San Francisco, have also started lease negotiations. San Francisco's public defender, Mano Raju, estimated that 20 to 30 percent of the local jail population did not have anywhere to live.\n\n\"People coming out of the jail are one of the most vulnerable populations, and we need to be sure they have housing so they don't contract the virus,\" Raju said.\n\nSgt. Kelly hopes that Alameda County's plan can serve as a model for other jurisdictions grappling with how to safely release people from jails. He stated, \"People should be looking to California. We have a week ahead of a lot of other jurisdictions. They don't need to reinvent the wheel on this.\"",
    " Title: Administration Proposes Charging 'Event Management' Costs for Protests, Sparks First Amendment Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and concerns over freedom of speech, the Trump administration has proposed a plan that could potentially charge citizens for participating in protests near the White House. The proposal, introduced by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in August, suggests the closure of 80% of the sidewalks surrounding the White House and the imposition of 'event management' costs for demonstrations.\n\nCurrently, the National Park Service recovers costs for special events but not for spontaneous protests, such as those that typically take place in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The proposed charges could encompass costs related to erecting barriers, cleaning fees, repairs to grass, permit fees, and the salaries of personnel on hand to monitor such demonstrations, all tallied at the discretion of the police.\n\nCivil liberties groups have expressed concern over these proposals, viewing them as a direct affront to the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has stated that such fees \"could make mass protests like Martin Luther King Jr's historic 1963 March on Washington and its 'I have a dream' speech too expensive to happen.\"\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the federal government attempted to impose similar barriers on citizens freely assembling in protest. The ACLU sued the government, and in their ruling, the courts reasserted the importance of parks for public assembly and the airing of opinions in democratic society. The White House sidewalk, Lafayette Park, and the Ellipse were deemed unique sites for the exercise of these rights, and the courts could not \"accord deference to an executive approach to use of the White House sidewalk that is rooted in a bias against expressive conduct.\"\n\nBrie Jackson (@PositivelyBrie) tweeted, \"If you have to pay for free speech, it's not free.\"\n\nThe National Park Service has attempted to justify the proposal by citing the overtaxing of their abilities by large protests, such as the Women's March, and the heavy cost they place on the government. However, some argue that when it comes to preserving the right to protest, no cost is too high.\n\nThe public has until October 15 to comment on the plans.",
    " Title: Gas Prices: A Surprising Look at the True Cost Across U.S. States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Labor Day travel weekend approaches, a new study by GasBuddy sheds light on an unexpected aspect of gasoline costs across the United States. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Southeast, often considered the cheapest region for gasoline, is surprisingly expensive when factoring in average gasoline usage, local wages, and local labor needed to fill up a car for a year.\n\nPatrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, commented, \"There are some surprises here. You tend to see areas that are more rural, with challenged incomes or lower median hourly wages where the true cost of filling up is more hard work than other areas.\"\n\nTo determine the true cost of filling up, GasBuddy calculated the average amount of gasoline consumed per driver for every state, average hourly wages in those states, and the average gas price for each state as of Aug. 1. This allowed the researchers to assess \"how much work it would take\" to pay for a year's worth of gas, according to DeHaan.\n\nFor instance, Mississippi, which had the second-lowest average price per gallon in the country on Thursday ($2.20), ranks as the fifth most expensive state in the country, requiring an average of 100.3 hours of work to pay for a year's worth of gas. On the flip side, Hawaii, which had the highest average price per gallon on Thursday ($3.66), is actually the 11th cheapest state in the country, requiring an average of 80.4 hours of work to pay for a year's worth of gas.\n\nPeople living in most Northeast states need the fewest number of hours worked to pay for their gas. Measured by these standards, the cheapest state in the country is Massachusetts at only 66.8 hours, followed by Connecticut at 70.6, Maryland at 71.7, New York at 73.8, Rhode Island at 75.4, and Delaware at 76.8.\n\nOne big reason: People don't drive as much in the Northeast, where mass transit options are more prevalent. Some states that have a high cost per gallon also rank as the most expensive when measured by the number of hours worked to pay for a year's worth of gas. Nevada, which had the fourth-highest price per gallon on Thursday ($3.12), requires the most hours worked at 107.7, according to GasBuddy.\n\nHere's the full list of states, ranked by the number of hours the average person needs to work to afford a year of gas, according to GasBuddy:\n\n1. Nevada 107.7\n2. Montana 107.4\n3. Idaho 107.1\n4. South Dakota 101.4\n5. Mississippi 100.3\n6. Oregon 100.1\n7. West Virginia 98.8\n8. Arkansas 98.2\n9. Utah 97.0\n10. California 95.5\n11.

    " Title: Hillary Clinton Advocates for Gun Control Reform at Mental Health Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the National Council for Behavioral Health conference in Maryland on Tuesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about the prevalence of gun ownership in the United States. Clinton urged Americans to reconsider the notion that \"anybody can have a gun, anywhere, anytime,\" stating that this perspective is not in the best interest of the majority of citizens.\n\n\"I think again we're way out of balance. I think that we've got to rein in what has become an almost article of faith that anybody can have a gun anywhere, anytime,\" Clinton said. \"And I do not believe that is in the best interest of the vast majority of people. And I think you can say that and still support the right of people to own guns.\"\n\nClinton's comments come amidst ongoing debates about gun control in the United States. The right to own a gun has been a constitutional right since the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791. Clinton, however, seems to view the right to bear arms as a recent and irresponsible shift in society.\n\nDuring her speech, Clinton highlighted the potential dangers of widespread gun ownership, particularly in public settings like movie theaters, where shootings have occurred over seemingly minor incidents such as loud gum chewing or cellphone use. \"That's what happens in the countries I've visited where there is no rule of law and no self-control, and that is something that we can not just let go without paying attention,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked about which countries Clinton was referring to, specific details were not provided. However, it is worth noting that in England, crime rates rose 35 percent in areas where guns were banned. Additionally, a 2013 Harvard study found an association between high gun ownership and low crime rates globally.\n\nWhile American gun ownership is high, many other developed nations, such as Norway, Finland, Germany, France, and Denmark, have high rates of gun ownership but lower murder rates than the United States. For example, Luxembourg, where handguns are totally banned and gun ownership is minimal, had a murder rate nine times higher than Germany in 2002.\n\nClinton did not confirm whether or not she will run for president in 2016, but she encouraged Americans to \"stay tuned.\" Her comments on gun control are a reflection of her ongoing interest in the issue and her desire for a more balanced approach to gun ownership in the United States.",
    " Title: Walker and Bush Share Similar Stances on Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has found himself in a predicament over immigration, following the dismissal of a communications aide after old tweets criticizing Rep. Steve King (R-IA) were brought to light. The aide, Liz Mair, had previously tweeted, \"In other news, Iowa is once again embarrassing itself, and the GOP, this morning. Thanks, guys, \" in reference to King's January 24th Iowa Freedom Summit where Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Carly Fiorina, and other potential Republican presidential candidates spoke.\n\nWalker's immigration troubles began in January when his past statements supporting a \"path to citizenship\" and the Senate's Gang of 8 bill were circulated. Since then, Walker has attempted to distance himself from these positions, stating on Fox News Sunday on March 1st, \"My view has changed. I\u2019m flat-out saying it. Candidates can say that, sometimes they don\u2019t.\"\n\nWalker's stance on immigration has evolved over time. In July 2013, he expressed, \"You hear some people talk about border security and a wall and all that. To me, I do not know that you need any of that if you had a better, saner way to let people into the country in the first place.\" In contrast, in March 2015, he stated, \"I've talked to people all across America. And the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works. A legal immigration system that works. And part of doing this is put the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that.\"\n\nDespite this shift in rhetoric, Walker still maintains that illegal immigrants currently in the United States should be given a path to citizenship, but only after the border is secured. In response to a question about a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who pay a penalty, Walker stated, \"I believe there's a way that you can do that. First and foremost, you've got to secure that border or none of these plans make any sense.\"\n\nThis stance on immigration appears to align closely with that of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. When asked about a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, Bush responded, \"I think the best plan, the most realistic plan, the grown-up plan, if you will, is once you control the border and you\u2019re confident it\u2019s not going to be another magnet, is to say, \u2018Let\u2019s let these folks achieve earned legal status where they work, where they come out of the shadows.\u2019\"\n\nIn summary, both Walker and Bush advocate for securing the border before addressing the status of illegal immigrants already in the United States, with the ultimate goal of granting them earned legal status. The differences, if any, between their immigration policies are not immediately apparent.",
    " Title: Kennedy's Critique of Conservative Media: A Closer Look at the Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent discussion on HuffPost Live, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed concerns about the right-wing influence in the American media, particularly Fox News. Kennedy argued that 95% of talk radio in the U.S. is right-wing, and 22% of Americans consider Fox News their primary news source. He claimed that this has contributed to the country's division since the Civil War and has empowered certain ideologues in the U.S. Congress.\n\nKennedy's comments have sparked a debate about media bias in the United States. While many conservatives also complain about liberal media, Kennedy's criticism has drawn attention to the perceived bias in conservative media outlets like Fox News. Kennedy's argument, however, is not just about media bias but also the role it plays in the country's political landscape.\n\nThe debate over media bias is not new, and it is essential to understand that both conservative and liberal media outlets have their biases. Conservative media, such as Fox News, often present themselves as unbiased journalists, while liberal media, such as MSNBC, openly lean towards the left. The key difference lies in the self-perception of these outlets. Conservative media, like talk radio hosts and Fox News, generally hold themselves out as commentators, while liberal media, like many news networks, hold themselves out as unbiased journalists.\n\nKennedy's criticism of conservative media is not just about bias but also about the impact it has on the political landscape. He argues that the conservative media's influence has contributed to the division in the country and the rise of the Tea Party ideology within the Republican Party. While it is essential to acknowledge the role of media in shaping public opinion, it is also crucial to recognize that the nation's division is a result of differing worldviews, not just media bias.\n\nKennedy's comments have sparked a conversation about media bias and its impact on the political landscape. While it is essential to acknowledge the role of media in shaping public opinion, it is also crucial to recognize that the nation's division is a result of differing worldviews, not just media bias.

    " Title: The Debate on Gun Control: A Constitutional Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past month, President Obama and Vice President Biden have expressed a commitment to address safety issues in the United States, with a particular focus on gun control. This has been met with bipartisan condemnation of violence and promises of action from Congress. However, the question remains: What role does the federal government, as defined by the U.S. Constitution, have in regulating firearms?\n\nThe Constitution, drafted by the Founding Fathers, was created to establish a federal government of limited powers, derived from the states. The states, in turn, are sovereign entities, deriving their powers from the people who reside there. The Constitution grants the federal government 16 unique, discrete powers, all of which concern national matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and interstate commerce. The areas of health, safety, welfare, and morality were not delegated to the federal government and remain under the jurisdiction of the states.\n\nThis understanding is based on the language of the Constitution itself and the records of the state ratifying conventions. During these conventions, small-government advocates warned against the creation of a central government that would resemble the British government from which the colonies had just seceded. They were assured that the unique separation of powers between the states and the federal government would prevent power from becoming concentrated in the central government.\n\nEven in the late 18th century, both big- and small-government proponents agreed that the new government was limited to the powers delegated to it by the states, with the states retaining the powers they did not delegate away. This principle was further solidified with the addition of the Bill of Rights and the 10th Amendment, which affirmed that the powers not delegated to the federal government were reserved for the states or the people.\n\nThe Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the \"police power,\" or the power to regulate for health, safety, welfare, and morality, remains with the states, and there is no federal police power. This is in line with the philosophical principle of \"subsidiarity,\" which states that governmental intervention should be the minimum needed and that problems closest to the people should be addressed by the government closest to those people.\n\nPresident Obama, Vice President Biden, and their colleagues in government, who have a history of advocating for expansive federal intervention, are now involved in the gun control debate. While the Constitution prohibits all governments, including the federal government, from infringing upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms, some progressives argue for increased federal regulation in the name of public safety.\n\nThe Constitution's purpose is to protect personal freedom from the lust for power of those in government and from the passions of the people who elect them. As the debate on gun control continues, it is crucial to remember the principles upon which our nation was founded and to uphold the balance of power between the federal government and the states.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts to Avert Government Shutdown Amid Immigration and Spending Bill Disagreements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avoid a potential government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada announced on Monday that he has been engaged in productive, bipartisan discussions with Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, regarding the passing of the spending bill.\n\n\"It's clear to me that Republican leaders want to work together to keep the government funded,\" Mr. Reid said. \"I hope Republicans in Congress will reject this brinkmanship. A scorched-earth policy is no way to govern. Instead, responsible leaders within the Republican Party need to work with Democrats to complete the business of funding our government, regardless of when the president acts to keep families together.\"\n\nHowever, some Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, have left the possibility of a shutdown on the table. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, an outspoken opponent of an immigration overhaul, is preparing legislation to reverse any actions taken by the president regarding immigration.\n\n\"I'd like to find a way we can keep as much of the government operating as possible, but there's no way that this Congress should go forward with any appropriations that goes into any department that reacts to the command of the president when he commands that they violate the law or the Constitution,\" Mr. King said last week.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, shared similar concerns, stating that any unilateral action by the president could jeopardize the opportunity for bipartisan immigration legislation once Republicans control both chambers in the next Congress.\n\n\"I hope he will reconsider, decide to work with us in a bipartisan, bicameral way to fix our broken immigration system,\" Mr. Cornyn said. \"If he proceeds forward with his executive order, it will squander the best opportunity we've had in a long time to make progress.\"\n\nEven Republicans who are critical of the president's actions on immigration and his perceived overstepping of constitutional authority have expressed opposition to a government shutdown.\n\n\"I'm just unalterably opposed to another government shutdown. I'm not going to do that to my state, and I will do everything in my power to see that we don't shut down the government,\" said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. \"There are lots of ways we can respond, including going to court, including appropriations bills, including the Budget Act. There are lots of the things we can do. Shutting down the government should not be one of the options.\"",

In Brazil, she was instrumental in organizing peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. The country was grappling with widespread corruption, and many of its politicians, the source of much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and a select few.\n\nHowever, the excessive spending on the World Cup drained the country's already depleted resources, providing an opportunity for Song and Brazilians from across the political spectrum to come together. Their collective protests led to a government investigation into corruption, and ultimately, many politicians were imprisoned, and the country's president, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached.\n\nShortly after the protests, Song moved to the United States on a family visa, eventually being granted temporary residency, allowing her the right to work. She then embarked on a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.\n\nArriving in this new country, Song thought that her activism days were behind her. However, she noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans struggling to make ends meet. Sensing the disconnect and the growing power of the political elite, she began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.\n\nSong advocates for her belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven't guessed yet, she identifies as a Republican and supports President Donald Trump's emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Issue Warning to GOP on Obamacare Repeal: \"They Have Failed to Come Up with a Plausible Replacement\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - Senate Democrats are issuing a stern warning to Republicans planning a swift repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) next year: Do not count on Democratic support to help replace it.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Sen. Patty Murray, who will be the third-ranking Senate Democrat in the new Congress, stated, \"If they take it away, they better tell us how to fix it because they broke it.\" Murray's comments indicate the challenges ahead for GOP leaders and the Trump administration as they plan an immediate assault on President Barack Obama's signature legislative item.\n\nUnder Senate rules, Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democratic senators to reach the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster and replace Obamacare. Top Democrats are warning that the GOP will get little cooperation from their caucus on a replacement plan if they dismantle the health care law.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, told CNN Thursday, \"They're going to find repealing Obamacare without putting in a replacement will be far more disastrous and less clever than they think.\"\n\nRepublicans are gambling that Democrats will buckle, particularly Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 from states President-elect Donald Trump won. They face pressure to put a new system in place to avoid chaos in the health care system.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Schumer's chief deputy, said Republicans have a \"responsibility as far as I'm concerned about coming up with a replacement.\" Asked if that meant he'd support Democratic efforts to block a replacement plan, Durbin pushed back, stating, \"I want to know what the replacement is going to be. I want to know if it's real protection, and as good as [ the Affordable Care Act ] for the millions who count on it.\"\n\nGOP leaders are weighing a plan that would delay the health care repeal from taking effect for up to three years, giving Congress time to craft a new system to provide health insurance for the millions who could lose it. They are also planning an ambitious legislative agenda in the new year, moving forward on a plan to rewrite the tax code, a new government funding bill, and confirming a spate of Trump's nominees, including to the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, dealing with the red-hot issue of health care could be the trickiest, especially since there's no consensus within the GOP yet on what the replacement plan would look like. Even if the GOP writes into its legislation that a repeal won't take effect for three years, some health policy experts warn that the health care system could collapse immediately because insurers may pull out of the expiring system. That could intensify pressure on the GOP to find a solution right away.\n\nThe issue has been discussed at length between House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and senior Trump officials. It dominated talk among top House Republicans in a closed-door meeting Thursday. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole, who attended the meeting, conceded that moving ahead with repeal will put the burden on Republicans to lay out the next steps.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, who will chair the conservative House Freedom Caucus next Congress, said the GOP was still sorting out its plans on the issue. \"There's still a lot of discussion about the transition,\" Meadows said Thursday, but said members all agree they want to start with the repeal component early in the new year.\n\nHowever, Cole is confident top GOP leaders working with Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, who is Trump's nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services, will methodically manage the process. Moreover, House Republicans on Thursday selected a loyal Ryan ally, Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, to chair the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, giving him a key role in drafting a replacement to the health care law.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters earlier this week that he expected to move legislation to roll back the law first, and hammer out replacement legislation later. But he also believed that once Democrats realized the system they supported was going away, and they would be motivated to be part of the new solution\u2014or risk appearing too political.\n\n\"I don't think you have to wait,\" McCarthy told reporters.",
    " Title: California Legislature Passes Bill Requiring Presidential Candidates to Release Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns before appearing on the state's primary ballot. The legislation, authored by Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, marks the latest move in California's ongoing political standoff with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe bill, which was passed by a Democratic-controlled Legislature after similar measures failed to advance in other states, comes as California continues to challenge the Trump administration on various policy and political fronts.\n\n\"For 40 years, Democrats and Republicans alike have released their tax returns,\" Sen. McGuire said on the Senate floor. \"It's time that California holds this president and all future presidents accountable.\"\n\nHowever, the enforceability of the bill remains in question. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that states cannot add to the qualifications for U.S. Senate or House members, according to a legislative analysis. California's legislative counsel also released an opinion ahead of the vote calling the measure unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, other legal experts have argued that such a requirement could pass constitutional muster. The bill would require presidential candidates to file copies of their five most recent tax returns with state officials, who would then make them public.\n\nIt is unclear if Governor Jerry Brown will sign the measure. While Trump is the first president in years to ascend to the White House without releasing his tax returns, Brown has also resisted similar disclosures. In a break with longstanding tradition of gubernatorial candidates in California, he did not release his tax returns during his 2010 or 2014 campaigns.\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate on the final day of this year's legislative session, after gaining approval in California's lower house the previous day. The measure now heads to Brown's desk for his consideration.",
    " Title: Canada's Historic Shift: The First Day of Recreational Cannabis Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nCanada marked a significant milestone on Wednesday as the country legalized the recreational use of cannabis, making it only the second nation in the world to do so. The day was marked by celebrations, long queues, and a shift in societal norms, but concerns about increased use among youth and new safety issues were also raised.\n\nIan Power, a resident of Newfoundland and Labrador, was the first person to make a legal purchase, while Alex Smith, a resident of British Columbia, was among the many who made their way to the BC Cannabis Store, the only legal store in the province. The store, located in an unassuming strip mall, boasted a clean, \"west coast casual\" interior and a range of products.\n\nFor many, the legalization of cannabis was a significant moment, offering a sense of relief and justification for those who had previously hidden their consumption. However, the day was not a free-for-all, with several aspects of cannabis consumption remaining illegal. Users must be 18 or 19 (depending on the province) to purchase, and there are penalties for those caught selling to minors.\n\nCanadians are limited to the number of plants they can grow and can only hold 30 grams (one ounce) on their person in public at a time. The government also introduced new drug-impaired driving legislation, with stiff fines and possible jail time for those found to be driving under the influence. Police will be able to demand suspected drivers take a roadside sobriety test or provide a saliva sample to test for THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis.\n\nThe reliability of these saliva tests has raised concerns, and legal experts expect challenges to the law to make their way to court. The Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling legalization \"a national, uncontrolled experiment in which the profits of cannabis producers and tax revenues are squarely pitched against the health of Canadians.\"\n\nThe Canadian Psychiatric Society cautioned Canadians under 25 about using cannabis, warning that early and regular use can affect memory, attention, and the ability to process thoughts and experience and could increase the risk of developing mental health issues like depression in people already vulnerable to them. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada also warned of the potential negative impact of cannabis use during pregnancy on the developing fetus.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, who promised to make marijuana legal in 2014, was hailed for his role in the legalization. He admitted to smoking cannabis five or six times in the past, even once as a sitting member of parliament. Trudeau, known for his love of jogging and healthy eating, told journalists in Ottawa on Wednesday that he does not even drink coffee and has \"no intention of using marijuana.\"\n\nThe government has waived wait time and fees for those who have served their time for minor cannabis possession convictions and want to apply for a pardon. This move was praised as a first step, but some advocates are calling for convictions to be expunged entirely.\n\nThe day was also marked by humor, with police departments using the occasion to poke fun at standard stoner tropes and media outlets engaging in impassioned debates over what to call the day, but no general consensus was reached. The day's events will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion and analysis in the days and weeks to come.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Voters to Embrace Long-Term Economic Vision in Second Term Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his previous campaign rhetoric, President Barack Obama called on voters to choose a more challenging path towards long-term economic prosperity during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. The speech, which concluded three days of speeches from Democratic leaders, emphasized the party's commitment to safeguarding the interests of the struggling middle class.\n\nObama acknowledged the nation's economic struggles, the persistently high unemployment rate, and the sense of an unfulfilled future. In a departure from his 2008 campaign and his 2004 convention speech that catapulted him into national politics, Democrats also argued, in the strongest terms yet, that Republican nominee Mitt Romney is an out-of-touch plutocrat lacking in simple patriotism.\n\n\"America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now,\" Obama said. \"Yes, our path is harder \u2013 but it leads to a better place. Yes, our road is longer \u2013 but we travel it together.\"\n\nObama sought to balance empathy for voters in the midst of an economic downturn with an optimistic vision for the future. He has faced criticism throughout the 2012 campaign for failing to deliver a clear, forward-looking economic vision and for focusing too much on the high unemployment rate.\n\nIn an effort to present a more specific economic agenda, Obama outlined several goals for his second term, including the creation of a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016, a significant reduction in oil imports, 600,000 jobs in the natural gas industry, 100,000 new math and science teachers, and new controls on the rising cost of college tuition.\n\nThe means of achieving these goals were not detailed in the speech, but Obama reiterated his intention to extract sacrifices from the wealthiest citizens and special interests to foster widespread economic growth.\n\nThroughout the speech and the evening, there was a palpable undercurrent of America-first triumphalism, and a combination of implicit and explicit charges that Republicans do not share this brand of nationalism.\n\n\"I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers \u2013 goods that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America,\" Obama said. \"Now you have a choice: we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here, in the United States of America.\"\n\nObama also took the opportunity to mock his opponents and question their readiness for the presidency, in an apparent reference to Romney's stumbling summer trip overseas. \"You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally,\" he quipped.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill, Replaces National Security Adviser, and Implements Tariffs on Chinese Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has signed a $1.3 trillion spending plan to fund the government through September, marking the end of a contentious week in Washington. Lawmakers passed the bill in the early hours of Friday morning, and Trump had initially indicated he might veto it, criticizing the lack of action on the DACA debate and his border wall.\n\nIn a tweet on March 23, 2018, Trump expressed his displeasure with the bill, stating, \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nHowever, Trump ultimately decided to sign the bill, citing national security concerns. \"There are a lot of things I'm not happy about in this bill,\" Trump said Friday afternoon. \"I say to Congress, I will never sign a bill like this again.\"\n\nThe bill passed the House and Senate with robust bipartisan support, but conservatives in both houses criticized it, complaining they had just seven hours to read the 2,232-page bill, which they described as the \"length of two Bibles.\" The price tag, they say, is too high and includes line items they can't stomach, like money for Planned Parenthood.\n\nOne item in the measure that both sides celebrated is the Taylor Force Act, named for an American combat veteran brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while visiting Israel. The Palestinian government gave him a hero's welcome upon his return to Ramallah, prompting the bill, which suspends all US money to the Palestinian Authority until they change their laws incentivizing their young people to kill Americans and Jews.\n\nMeanwhile, there's a shakeup in the president's inner circle. Trump is replacing his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, with John Bolton, former US ambassador to the UN and outspoken hawk on foreign affairs. Bolton echoes Trump's tough policies against North Korea and Iran, and his new position increases the chance the US will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nRelations with China are also tense after the president announced he'll charge tariffs on as much as $60 billion in Chinese imports to the US. China responded Friday, announcing a list of American goods, like apples, pork, and steel pipes, that they may hit with higher import taxes. This move is expected to impact the American middle class, many of whom are Trump supporters, heading into the midterm elections and Trump's re-election bid in 2020.\n\n\"A trade war will not help anybody,\" warned Cui Tiankai, Chinese ambassador to the US. \"It will certainly affect the daily lives of the American middle class people.\" President Trump, however, says he's doing things for the country that should have been done long ago.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Praises George W. Bush's Foreign Policy, Critiques Obama's in CNN Interview\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed her appreciation for the foreign policy of former President George W. Bush, particularly his emergency program for AIDS relief in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton seemed to take a critical stance on President Obama's foreign affairs policies. She emphasized the importance of America clarifying its identity, values, and intentions on the international stage.\n\nClinton stated, \"We have to go back out and sell ourselves. It is not to be taken for granted. What do we stand for and how do we intend to lead and manage? How do we try to enlist the rest of the world in this struggle between cooperation and order and conflict and disorder which is really at the root of so much that\u2019s going on today \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a very good job of that.\"\n\nClinton also highlighted the long-term impact of Bush's policies, particularly his AIDS relief program, which she said is still highly regarded in Sub-Saharan Africa. She noted, \"George W. Bush is very popular in Sub-Saharan Africa. Why? Because of the president\u2019s emergency program for AIDS relief. Whether you agree or disagree with a lot of what else he did \u2014 and I disagree with a lot of it \u2014 I am proud to be an American when I go to Sub-Saharan Africa and people say, \u2018I want to thank President Bush and the United States for helping us fight HIV/AIDS.\u2019\"\n\nClinton also suggested that America could be more effective in exerting influence globally if it were clearer about its identity, values, and intentions. Fox News analysts speculate that Clinton's comments may be an attempt to distance herself from Obama's foreign policy, should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016.\n\nClinton's comments have sparked debate and discussion, with some interpreting them as a genuine appreciation for Bush's foreign policy and others viewing them as a strategic move in political positioning. Regardless of interpretation, Clinton's remarks underscore the ongoing debate about the role of the United States in global affairs and the importance of clear and consistent foreign policy.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Mitt Romney's Foreign Policy Stance Amid Middle East Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the recent attacks on U.S. missions in Libya and Egypt, a heated debate has ensued over the response of the Obama administration and the subsequent comments made by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee. A timeline of events suggests that Romney may have misrepresented the Obama administration's initial response to the crisis.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo released a statement condemning the actions of those who abuse free speech to hurt religious beliefs. The statement, issued before protests erupted in parts of the Arab world, did not specifically mention the controversial video that sparked the outrage among Muslims. After the statement, protesters breached the embassy in Cairo, ultimately tearing down the American flag.\n\nAt 6:30 p.m. ET, the embassy tweeted about its earlier statement, stating that the condemnation still stood. At 10:10 p.m. ET, Romney's campaign released a statement criticizing the Obama administration, characterizing the embassy's statement as the administration's \"first response\" and accusing it of sympathizing with those who waged the attacks.\n\nHowever, the embassy's statement was issued before the breach, and the embassy reiterated the statement on Twitter after the protestors were over the walls. At 12:11 a.m. ET, Obama's re-election campaign put out a statement accusing Romney of taking a political swipe during the crisis.\n\nRomney's comments on Wednesday characterized the response as an \"apology,\" but the embassy's statement was not actually an apology but a condemnation. The Republican nominee's comments raise questions about his stance on the offensive video and his interpretation of the events.\n\nRomney has since defended his comments, stating that the embassy's statement came after the grounds were breached. However, this contradicts the timeline of events. Romney's campaign has also released talking points advising Republicans on how to respond to questions about the embassy's condemnation of the controversial video.\n\nThe controversy has brought foreign policy to the forefront of the campaign, with Romney accusing Obama of a lack of clarity in his foreign policy and the Obama campaign accusing Romney of politicizing the crisis. The question remains whether Romney's comments on the crisis accurately reflect the events that transpired and whether his stance on free speech extends to controversial content.\n\n- By Elise Labott, Peter Hamby, Rachel Streitfeld, Jill Dougherty, Ashley Killough, and Kevin Liptak.\n- With attacks in Middle East, campaign turns to foreign policy.",
    " Title: President Trump's Tax Bill Heads to House and Senate Floors: A Look at the $1.5 Trillion Republican Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Donald Trump's long-anticipated tax reform bill is set to reach the floors of the House and Senate this week, marking a potential first major legislative victory for the President's administration. The bill, which aims to deliver a \"giant tax cut for Christmas,\" could be passed as early as Tuesday.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning, described the bill as a \"huge deal\" not just for the White House but for America as a whole. She asserted that middle-class Americans would benefit from the tax package.\n\nThe bill, the first significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986, is expected to provide tax relief to working families, encourage job creation, and spur economic growth. As of Monday, Senate Republicans had secured enough support to pass the bill, with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) flipping to 'yes' votes.\n\nHowever, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has yet to commit, stating that he is still reviewing the bill. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) will not be present for Tuesday's vote due to his ongoing battle with brain cancer.\n\nIn the House, Republicans can only lose 22 votes to still approve the bill. This week, a dozen Republican lawmakers have switched from 'no' to 'yes' votes, primarily from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California.\n\nThe final bill is a combination of elements from both the House and Senate bills, featuring a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent, a doubling of the standard deduction, and a doubling of the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. The bill also repeals a significant part of the Affordable Care Act, removing the requirement that all Americans have health insurance or face a penalty.\n\nThe bill's impact on taxpayers varies. While it offers average initial tax cuts for Americans across all income levels, by 2027, it would result in increased taxes for those earning up to $75,000. Nonpartisan congressional tax analysts project that in 2019, people earning $20,000 to $50,000 would see tax cuts averaging 10 percent or more. Those making $200,000 to $1 million would see reductions averaging slightly less.\n\nHowever, by 2023, people making under $30,000 would see tax increases, while those earning more would see their tax cuts get smaller.\n\nDemocrats in both chambers have expressed criticism of the bill, with concerns that it favors big corporations and wealthy Americans, and potentially hurts middle-class Americans. Despite this, Democratic senators Dick Durbin and Joe Manchin, among others, were at the White House Monday evening, indicating a potential for bipartisan cooperation.\n\nRepublican leaders have dismissed negative projections, with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) stating, \"That's just cherry-picking the numbers.\"\n\nThe bill will first be voted on in the House Tuesday afternoon, with a Senate vote expected later Tuesday into early Wednesday.",
    " Title: Camp David Summit: Obama Seeks to Assuage Gulf Allies' Concerns Over Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming Camp David summit between President Obama and Gulf leaders is aimed at alleviating concerns among America's Arab partners that the emerging nuclear deal with Iran does not signal a withdrawal from the region. However, the meeting, set to take place this week, may struggle to address the deeply rooted cultural, religious, and ideological tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which span centuries.\n\nThe Camp David summit, held in the tranquil surroundings of the Maryland presidential retreat, is unlikely to bridge the significant differences between the U.S. and Gulf leaders regarding Iran, as well as other regional security matters, some analysts suggest.\n\nKarim Sadjadpour, senior Iran policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, states, \"The US wants the Gulf to be OK with this nuclear deal with Iran, but the Gulf is not OK with it, so there continues to be this disconnect.\"\n\nGulf leaders attending the summit, which includes a White House dinner on Wednesday night and a full-day meeting at Camp David on Thursday, will be seeking tangible signs of U.S. support, likely resulting in announcements of arms sales and increased joint military exercises. However, these conventional forms of reassurance may not bridge the wide gaps between the U.S. and Gulf states on Iran, as well as other regional security issues, some experts predict.\n\nThe Gulf states are concerned not only about Iran's legitimized nuclear program and the potential financial windfall from lifted international sanctions, but also about Iran's increased influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. \"Their top concern is that Iran will feel empowered to double down on its practices in the region,\" Mr. Sadjadpour says.\n\nFurthermore, the Gulf Arabs worry that Iran's expanding influence is not a result of U.S. neglect or mistakes, but rather a consequence of U.S. policy, according to Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.\n\nBeyond Iran, another disconnect between the U.S. and Gulf states is the implementation of security roles in the region. The Obama administration's policy of \"leading from behind\" and delegating greater security responsibilities to regional partners may be tested at the Camp David summit.\n\n\"We do want the Gulf to take greater responsibility \u2013 but the way they are doing it is not always helpful,\" says Frederic Wehrey, an expert in Gulf and North Africa security at Carnegie. Examples of actions that the U.S. has either supported or criticized include the Saudi air campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, Gulf funding for some Syrian rebel groups linked to extremist elements, and United Arab Emirates intervention in Libya against Islamist forces.\n\nIf the Camp David summit delivers little more than new arms sales, perhaps some new missile defense initiative, and some joint military exercises, it will be unfortunate, experts say. Despite the focus on Iran, most of the major challenges the Gulf states face are internal, such as providing jobs to a large youth population, undertaking political reform, and countering extremist ideologies \u2013 something Obama recognizes, Wehrey says. However, he sees the summit only skirting those domestic issues at best.\n\nIf the summit perpetuates the pattern of U.S. reassurances through military hardware, it will represent a missed opportunity for both the Gulf states and the U.S., Alterman says. If \"arming the Gulf states to make them feel more confident... means the US is arming [ them ] to act in Yemen and Libya and other places, independent of US judgment, using US training and equipment,\" he says, \"I think that represents a difficult problem for the United States.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Remarks on Allegations Spark Controversy as Two White House Aides Exit Amid Domestic Abuse Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump expressed his concern over the impact of allegations on individuals' lives, following the resignation of two White House aides, David Sorensen and Rob Porter, amid accusations of domestic abuse.\n\n\"There is no recovery for someone falsely accused,\" Mr. Trump tweeted, emphasizing the potential devastating effects of allegations on a person's life and career.\n\nThis week, the White House has faced criticism for its handling of the allegations, and Mr. Trump's comments have drawn swift condemnation. His remarks come at a time when the world is engaged in a widespread debate on sexual harassment and the misuse of power.\n\nIn his tweet, Mr. Trump did not mention either man, but warned that allegations could lead to a person's \"life and career gone.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Patty Murray responded with anger, stating that women's lives are affected daily by sexual violence and harassment. \"I'm going to keep standing with them, and trusting them, even if the president won't,\" she said.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier described Mr. Trump's comments as \"offensive.\" Some commentators also objected to his reference to due process, citing instances such as his promotion of a conspiracy theory about former President Barack Obama's nationality.\n\nMr. Sorensen has been accused by his former wife of being violent and emotionally abusive, while Mr. Porter faces allegations of domestic abuse from two ex-wives. Mr. Trump, who paid tribute to Mr. Porter during a press conference, stating that he \"said that he's innocent,\" has himself been accused of sexual misconduct, which he has strongly denied.\n\nThe president has also supported others who have faced abuse allegations, including Alabama Republican Roy Moore, who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate. Sexual misconduct claims have hit a growing list of influential men worldwide, following a flurry of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The #MeToo hashtag also went viral last year as more and more women shared their harassment experiences online.",
    " Title: Rep. Devin Nunes Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Twitter, Alleges Shadowbanning and Defamation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes, representing California's 22nd District, has filed a defamation lawsuit against Twitter, a GOP operative, and unnamed defendants behind parody accounts on the social media platform. The lawsuit, which seeks $250 million in damages, was initially reported to have been filed on Monday, but a deputy clerk in Virginia's Henrico County Circuit court confirmed on Tuesday that the lawsuit was actually filed on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News' Hannity, Nunes announced the lawsuit as the first of many he plans to file against technology companies for alleged bias against conservatives. The lawsuit, details of which were posted by Fox News without a case number or verification of filing, alleges that Twitter played a willing role in the abuse Nunes faced from parody accounts, including one using the Twitter handle @DevinNunesMom.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Twitter shadowbanned Nunes' account @DevinNunes, a process by which a social network can quietly curb the distribution or reach of a user's content without outright banning them. Nunes' document claims that this shadowbanning was intentional and was aimed at interfering with the federal election and his ongoing investigation as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nRepublicans have long argued that technology platforms, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have an unfair bias against conservative viewpoints, an argument that these companies have repeatedly denied. Last July, following a disputed report by Vice News, Twitter stated in a blog post that it does not shadow ban, defining the practice as making a user's content undiscoverable to everyone but that user. The company also stated that it does not shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.\n\nIt's unclear how Fox News obtained Nunes' complaint or why it stated that the suit had been filed on Monday. A Fox News spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Neither Nunes' attorney nor his press representative responded to requests for comment.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican communications strategist who is also named as a defendant in the suit, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email that she had not reviewed the documentation. Mair, who has been critical of Nunes on Twitter in the past, claimed she had learned of the congressman's plan to sue from another reporter and declined further comment.",
    " Title: \"The Evolution and Controversy Surrounding 'Cancel Culture': A Deep Dive into a Phenomenon Shaping Modern Society\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, the phrase \"Twitter, do your thing\" can spark a chain reaction, often leading to the phenomenon known as \"cancel culture.\" This online movement, initially coined by Black Twitter users in 2015, has evolved from calling out friends or acquaintances to targeting the powerful, resulting in firings, resignations, and boycotts.\n\nThe debate over cancel culture centers around whether mass public criticism furthers the cause of justice or if it represents a misinformed online witch hunt that poses a threat to free speech. The phenomenon has been criticized by politicians on both sides of the aisle, with President Trump labeling it as \"the very definition of totalitarianism,\" and former President Barack Obama expressing concerns about \"ambiguities\" in criticizing people's wrongdoing.\n\nCritics argue that cancel culture threatens freedom of speech and open debate. They contend that people should not face personal or professional repercussions for their opinions, as this would hinder the examination and growth of ideas. Disagreement is acceptable, but \"canceling\" someone is seen as going too far, as it denies people the opportunity to evolve and change their opinions over time.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of cancel culture argue that it serves to reverse deeply entrenched power structures. Social media empowers marginalized voices by providing them a platform to hold large companies and public figures accountable. Those who are critical of cancel culture are often seen as the elite, who are, for the first time, being held accountable.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that cancel culture rarely results in real systemic change and can even let companies off the hook by focusing on individual employees rather than addressing larger organizational issues. There are also instances where the online mob acts on incomplete information, as seen in the case of a viral video of a young woman at a boarded-up store.\n\nThe debate over cancel culture is complex and multifaceted, with no clear consensus. Some argue that there is no such thing as cancel culture, with worthwhile criticism being mislabeled as a new or exotic phenomenon. For instance, it is unlikely that influential figures like J.K. Rowling will ever truly be \"canceled,\" but it is important that they are held accountable for their statements.\n\nIn conclusion, cancel culture, whether a new phenomenon or not, is a topic of intense debate. Its impact on free speech, systemic change, and the survival of a tolerant society is a matter of ongoing discussion. As the debate continues, it is crucial to consider the nuances and potential consequences of this phenomenon on modern society.",
    " Title: Deadly Terror Attack at Garissa University in Kenya Leaves 147 Dead, Al-Shabab Claims Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nNairobi, Kenya \u2014 A brutal terrorist attack on a university in northern Kenya on Thursday left 147 people dead and dozens wounded in a 15-hour siege, with four militants killed by security forces. The Somali-based Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization, claimed responsibility for the attack, marking it as the deadliest in Kenya by the group.\n\nMore than 550 students were evacuated, and 79 were injured in the standoff on the Garissa University campus, approximately 90 miles from the Somali border. The attack, which targeted Christians and converts to Islam, is the latest in a series of violent incidents carried out by al-Shabab in Kenya.\n\nAccording to Kenya's National Police Service, the gunmen separated Christians from Muslims and held hostages in a dormitory, where they placed explosives around the Christian hostages. Kenya's Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery stated that some students were killed during morning prayers at the mosque.\n\nAden Duale, majority leader in Kenya's National Assembly, said, \"We will not allow terrorists to divide our country on religious lines.\"\n\nMost of the 147 dead were students. In addition to the students, two security guards, one policeman, and one soldier were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said. One suspected extremist was arrested as he attempted to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.\n\nHeavy gunfire erupted at the college as the Kenyan military worked to end the siege. Police Inspector General Joseph Boinett announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in place in Garissa and three neighboring counties starting Friday through April 16.\n\nThe White House strongly condemned the attack and stated that the United States was providing assistance to the Kenyan government. \"We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeting of Christian students,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.\n\nKenyan police offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin and Gamadhere, who they suspect planned the attack.\n\nStudents who were able to escape described the attack, with many stating that gunmen stormed the university, setting off explosives and shooting people on the campus just after 5 a.m. local time.\n\n\"Most of us were asleep when the incident happened,\" said Nicholas Ntulu, a student at the university. \"We heard heavy gunfire and explosions. Every person ran for dear life as we passed the gunmen. Several (students) were shot dead.\"\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta urged Kenyans to stay calm. \"This is a moment for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies,\" he said.\n\nKenyatta ordered the inspector general of police to accelerate the applications of 10,000 recruits for the Kenya Police College. \"We have suffered unnecessarily due to a shortage of security personnel,\" he said. \"Kenya badly needs additional officers, and I will not keep the nation waiting.\"\n\nFrightened students rescued from the university gathered at a military camp near the Garissa airstrip. \"The sounds of gunfire was all over \u2014 we could not tell what was the right direction to go to be safe,\" said Ann Musyoka, a second-year student. \"We had to face the gunmen \u2014 they shot several people as we escaped towards the gate.\"\n\nVictims were rushed to a hospital, and those critically injured were airlifted to the capital, Nairobi. \"I was not at the institution when the incident occurred, but several students phoned me, crying over the attacks,\" said Jacktone Kweya, the dean of students. \"When I tried calling them back, their phones were off. It's very disturbing.\"\n\nRobert Godec, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, said, \"We strongly condemn the attack.\" \"We extend our deepest condolences to all who have been affected,\" he said in a statement. \"The attack once again reinforces the need for all countries and communities to unite in the effort to combat violent extremism.\"\n\nThe assault comes in the wake of an intelligence report issued last week by security officials warning that al-Shabab was planning an attack on major institutions in retaliation for Kenyan military action in Somalia as part of an African Union initiative against the group. Al-Shabab has carried out several attacks in Garissa and across Kenya in the past few years, including an attack in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, and others on mosques in Mombasa, a coastal city in the east.\n\nNairobi-based security analyst Abdiwahab Sheikh stated that the incident highlights how the government has failed to shore up security in the country. \"The government has not learned anything from the Westgate attack,\" he said. \"How do you allow terrorists to take students hostage for more than 10 hours? I think our security forces need to learn from the past.\"",
    " Title: Record Tax Revenue Projected for Federal Government in 2013, Spending Remains High\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama initiates the next phase of budget negotiations with Congress, recent estimates suggest that the federal government's tax revenue may be significantly higher than previously thought. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected that the federal government is on track to bring in a record $2.7 trillion in tax receipts this fiscal year.\n\nThe increase in revenues reflects a steady post-recession rise, with a 6 percent increase in 2012 and an anticipated 11 percent jump in 2013. This expected tax boost follows the Congress and the White House's eleventh-hour deal at the start of the year, which allowed for an increase in tax rates for top earners and the expiration of a 2-point payroll tax cut.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has pointed out that the increased tax revenue is a significant factor in the current budget discussions. During an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend, Boehner stated, \"The president got $650 billion of higher taxes on the American people on January 1st. How much more does he want?\"\n\nPresident Obama, however, has emphasized his commitment to a balanced approach of spending cuts, revenue increases, and entitlement reform. During the first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Monday, he reiterated, \"I want to continue to push for the kind of balanced approach of spending cuts, revenues, entitlement reform that everybody knows is the right way to do things.\"\n\nHistorical figures from the White House show that the last tax revenue record was set in 2007, when the government collected nearly $2.6 trillion. By 2009, tax revenue took a dive, before gradually building back up.\n\nAccording to the CBO, as a percentage of GDP, revenue is still below the 40-year average of 18 percent. The 2013 figure would represent 16.9 percent of GDP, a full point higher than it was the year before.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has benefited from a variety of sources, including increases in corporate income taxes, estate, and excise taxes. Meanwhile, spending is on pace to hit $3.55 trillion in 2013, roughly the same as it was in 2012. According to the CBO, this represents 22.2 percent of GDP, a share that is still larger than in any year between 1986 and 2008.\n\nWhile Republicans argue that spending is the primary issue, both sides agree that cutting discretionary spending alone will not solve America's debt and deficit crisis. With the enactment of the sequester, Congress will cut deeper and deeper into discretionary spending. However, costly entitlements will continue to grow, driving up the U.S. debt and the annual interest taxpayers pay on that debt.",
    " Title: North Korea and US Exchange Threats as Tensions Escalate on Korean Peninsula\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange of words, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of declaring war on his country and stated that Pyongyang has the right to shoot down U.S. bombers, even if they are not in North Korean airspace. The White House dismissed the statement as \"absurd,\" while the Pentagon warned Pyongyang to stop provocations.\n\nMr. Ri's comments were a response to Mr. Trump's tweet that the North Korean leadership would not \"be around much longer\" if they continued their rhetoric. The North Korean minister's remarks, not the first time that North Korea has used the phrase \"a declaration of war\" in relation to the U.S., are the latest in an increasingly angry war of words between the two countries.\n\nMr. Ri's statement came two days after U.S. warplanes flew close to North Korea's coast in a show of force. Pentagon spokesman Col. Robert Manning reacted by saying, \"If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions, we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea.\"\n\nChina's ambassador to the UN, Liu Jieyi, expressed concern, telling Reuters, \"It's getting too dangerous and it's in nobody's interest.\" UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres' spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, warned, \"Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings.\"\n\nExperts have played down the risk of direct conflict between the two nations, but the real question is what practical consequences might ensue from the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang. It should be remembered that the Korean peninsula is not at peace - the Korean conflict of the 1950s was only brought to a halt by an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nThe latest North Korean threat to shoot down U.S. warplanes comes in the wake of a recent U.S. patrol that took its B1-B Lancer bombers and their accompanying F-15 fighter escorts over waters to the east of North Korea - the furthest north U.S. warplanes have flown for several months, albeit still outside Pyongyang's airspace. The U.S. believes it has every right to do this, but if one day Pyongyang judges that these aircraft are on an offensive mission - what then?\n\nThe escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea have raised concerns about the potential for renewed conflict on the Korean peninsula. Both nations have been engaged in a war of words, with each side issuing increasingly aggressive statements. The international community, particularly China, has expressed concern about the dangerous rhetoric and the potential for miscalculations leading to conflict. The situation remains tense, and the risk of renewed fighting cannot be ruled out.",
    " Title: Obama Pushes for Immediate Vote on Immigration Reform Plan, Challenges Congress to Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold move, President Obama has expressed his desire for an immediate vote on his immigration reform plan, urging Congress to act swiftly, barring agreement on another proposal. During a press conference on Tuesday, the President emphasized the bipartisan foundation already in place, referring to the bipartisan Senate bill proposed by the Gang of Eight senators.\n\n\"It's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place,\" Obama said, referring to the bipartisan Senate bill. \"And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.\"\n\nThis strategy mirrors Obama's approach during the \"fiscal cliff\" talks, where he pushed for an up-or-down vote on his own plan, letting higher income tax hikes take effect if lawmakers couldn't reach a deal.\n\nRepublicans have historically criticized this negotiation tactic, with GOP aides claiming that the President and congressional Democrats have sought political gain while refusing to negotiate in good faith. On immigration, this sentiment persists.\n\nThe President's plan includes a faster path to citizenship and no triggers for border-security enforcement. It also eases the path for same-sex couples.\n\nBefore the President unveiled his immigration plan in Nevada on Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida expressed concerns about a potential \"bidding war.\" In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh, Rubio dismissed the idea of an up-or-down vote, stating, \"I don't want to be part of a process that comes up with some bill in secret and brings it to the floor and gives people a take it or leave it.\"\n\nSenator Rubio emphasized his preference for a legislative process that allows for input from every senator and the public. A Senate Republican aide quipped, \"The President's been gone from the Senate a long time and perhaps he has forgotten that it's a lot easier to pass legislation if he works with Congress.\"\n\nThe President's plan, which is less favorable to Republicans than the bipartisan Senate group's plan, presents Republicans with a choice between the left and the middle. The bipartisan Senate group's plan includes triggers for border-security measures, more unmanned drones, and no provisions making it easier for same-sex couples seeking to immigrate or naturalize. Unless other Republicans come up with a plan of their own, the President has effectively set up a choice between the left and the middle, making it clear which direction they prefer.",
    " Title: New York Times Faces Allegations of Hostile Work Environment as Bari Weiss Resigns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing resignation letter, Bari Weiss, a conservative opinion writer for The New York Times, has announced her departure from the newspaper, citing a hostile work environment and a culture of intolerance towards dissenting views. Weiss's resignation follows the departure of editorial page editor James Bennet, who was ousted after publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., advocating for the use of the military against rioters.\n\nWeiss's letter paints a picture of a workplace rife with bullying, harassment, and discrimination. She alleges that she has been called a Nazi, a racist, and a liar by colleagues, and that her work and character have been openly demeaned on company-wide Slack channels. Weiss claims that some colleagues have called for her to be \"rooted out\" if the company is to be a truly \"inclusive\" one, while others have posted ax emojis next to her name.\n\nThe portrait Weiss paints of The Times' culture is one that has raised concerns about unlawful discrimination, a hostile work environment, and constructive discharge. Weiss, who is no legal expert, acknowledges that these terms may not be entirely accurate, but she is certain that the treatment she and her colleagues have received is wrong.\n\nThe allegations of a toxic work environment at The Times come as no surprise to those who have been paying attention. Matthew Continetti, a former Timesman, described the newspaper as \"gossipy, catty, insular, cliquey, stressful, immature, cowardly, moody, underhanded, spiteful,\" and as a \"hostile workplace.\"\n\nThe Times, once known as the \"Gray Lady,\" is now being compared to a middle school run by the \"Mean Girls\" crowd, with the management seemingly cowering in the face of junior staffers' complaints about published articles. The proper response to such complaints, according to Weiss, should be to either write a piece explaining why the piece in question is wrong or to fetch a latte.\n\nThe management's apparent inability to provide adult supervision has been attributed to Chairman Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who has been criticized for his response to complaints about un-Timesian coverage in the past. The newspaper's culture during Sulzberger's tenure has been described as \"moderate white men should die.\"\n\nWeiss's resignation letter is addressed to A.G. Sulzberger, the current publisher, who is the son of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. The apple, it seems, has not fallen far from the tree. The Times, according to Weiss, is in need of adult supervision, a sentiment echoed by many observers.\n\nAdolph Ochs, the founder of The Times, had a different vision for the newspaper. In 1896, he ambitioned to make the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, inviting intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion. For many years, The Times functioned as an arena for public debate, even if it leaned left. Now, however, junior staffers, fresh from the hothouse environment of academia, seem to want to make The Times a megaphone for a single set of views, which Weiss predicts will diminish the importance of the newspaper but not the self-importance of its staffers.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of The Times' Board of Contributors.",
    " Title: Fiscal Negotiations on Capitol Hill: Christmas Break Dispute Over Looming Economic Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing fiscal negotiations on Capitol Hill have taken a turn towards a holiday-themed standoff, with House Republicans vowing to remain in Washington over the Christmas break to prevent the impending economic crisis, while Democratic leadership insists that congressional members should be home for the holidays.\n\nRep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) expressed his anticipation for a long December, following instructions from House Speaker John Boehner. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor echoed Hastings' sentiments, stating that Republicans would work through the holidays to reach a deal to avoid the looming $500 billion mix of automatic tax increases and federal spending cuts set to take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn contrast, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressed hope for a deal before Christmas and emphasized that lawmakers should be home by then. \"Faith and family, that's what the holidays are about,\" Pelosi said during a news conference. \"These are bonding opportunities for families and strengtheners for our families. We should be home for that.\"\n\nThe recent optimism in Washington, sparked by a series of exchanges between Boehner and President Obama earlier this week, has been dampened by the renewed partisan rhetoric. Boehner's refusal Tuesday night to discuss his counter-offer and the most recent phone call suggested a deal was within reach, perhaps too fragile to be fought over in public.\n\nHowever, Boehner described Wednesday's conversation as \"deliberate\" and focused on the divide they face. The debate in Washington was not solely about working over the break, as Boehner also suggested during a morning news conference that the White House is holding up the deal, citing the lack of a balanced approach in the most recent proposal, with \"too many taxes\" and an uncertain passage in both the House and the Senate.\n\nPelosi quickly countered, placing the blame on Boehner and urging him to put House Republicans to a vote on what Obama has already offered, with some of her party members willing to accept a compromise to avert the fiscal crisis and extend tax cuts to 98 percent of income earners.\n\n\"Figure it out. We did,\" said Pelosi, referring to her past experience as House speaker and forcing a full vote on funding the Iraq War. \"Then go forward and debate the issue. What are we waiting for? Is there a dove going to fly in with a message tied to his leg?\"\n\nAs the Christmas break approaches, the fiscal cliff looms ever closer, and the negotiations on Capitol Hill continue to unfold.",
    " Title: Two More Individuals Corroborate Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo additional individuals have supported Tara Reade's claims that former Vice President Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993, according to a report by the Associated Press. One individual, who was acquainted with Reade during that year, confirmed that Reade had mentioned the alleged assault at the time it occurred. The second individual, who met Reade a decade later, recalled a conversation in which Reade discussed experiencing sexual harassment while working in Biden's Senate office. Both sources chose to remain anonymous to protect their families' privacy, the report stated.\n\nThis brings the total number of individuals backing some aspects of Reade's claims to four. Lynda LaCasse, a former neighbor of Reade's in California, previously stated that Reade shared details about the alleged assault in the 1990s, while Lorraine Sanchez, a former colleague, told Business Insider that Reade had complained about being sexually harassed by her former boss in Washington.\n\nReade was one of eight women who asserted that Biden made them feel uncomfortable due to inappropriate displays of affection. In an interview with the AP published on Saturday, Reade revealed that she submitted a limited report to a congressional personnel office but did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault or harassment.\n\n\"I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,\" Reade said in the interview. \"I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.\"\n\nAlthough she did not use the phrase \"sexual harassment\" in the complaint, she did use the words \"uncomfortable\" and \"retaliation.\"\n\nBiden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, denied the incident during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday. \"It is not true. I'm saying it unequivocally \u2013 it never happened. It didn't. It never happened,\" Biden said. He also stated that Reade did not express concerns to supervisors or senior staff members at the time.\n\n\"News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way,\" Biden wrote in a statement released before the interview. \"Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have,\" he added.",
    " Title: President Obama: Increased Discussion on Race Relations, Not Worsening Conditions, Causes Perceived Divide\n\nIn a year-end interview with NPR, President Barack Obama suggested that the nation's perception of worsening race relations is not a reflection of actual conditions, but rather a result of increased dialogue and awareness about race issues. The president's comments, made just before he left Washington for the holidays, offer insights into his thoughts on his final two years in office.\n\nObama had hoped 2014 would be a \"breakthrough year,\" with the economy showing significant improvement and a lessening of the nation's toxic politics. However, the year was marked by unexpected disasters and unplanned events, contributing to a drop in Obama's approval ratings and leaving him with limited power to prevent his party's loss of the Senate.\n\nTwo of the most challenging and dramatic events of 2014 involved police killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Yet, in the interview on Dec. 18, the president interpreted the widespread debate over these incidents as a sign of potential positive change.\n\nTwo days after the president's comments, a gunman murdered two New York City police officers. Despite this tragic event, the day of the interview, there was already evidence of division in the country.\n\nObama expressed an essentially optimistic view that better data for the public and better training for police can improve their interactions. He has assembled a task force to examine police and community relations, and said its members are \"interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country.\" The president expressed confidence that progress on this issue will be made in the coming year.\n\nOther race-related data presents a challenge to the president's party. Obama won election twice on the strength of an unprecedented minority vote, and the share of minorities in the electorate is growing. However, a flip side to this trend can be seen with white voters.\n\nThe collapse of the white vote was disastrous in the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. In a Senate race in Georgia, for example, it was estimated that Democrats needed little more than 25 percent of the white vote to win, but they failed to get it. This is why Republicans now dominate Congress and most state legislatures.\n\nObama's larger sentiment\u2014that it would be better for America if both major parties were able to compete seriously for the votes of all major racial and ethnic groups\u2014is shared by politicians in both parties. As 2014 draws to a close, that ideal is not yet a reality. This is the second installment of a three-part year-ending interview with President Obama, with the third focusing on his foreign policy.",
    " Title: Trump Cites Decreasing COVID-19 Death Projections, Advisers Remain Cautious on Reopening Guidelines\n\nIn a briefing on Friday, President Donald Trump expressed optimism about the decreasing death projections of the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that he believes the number of deaths will be significantly lower than the initial 100,000 forecast. The president's comments come as the White House's pandemic coordinator, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, and other public health advisers maintain a more cautious approach, emphasizing that the country has not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump referenced the latest estimate of 60,000 deaths as evidence of progress. \"I think we'll be substantially under that number,\" he said. \"Hard to believe that if you have 60,000, you can never be happy, but that's a lot fewer than we were originally told.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Birx took a more measured tone, stating, \"As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.\" She also noted that without universal testing, experts are only seeing the most serious cases, leaving uncertainty about the true extent of the outbreak. \"Is this the tip of the iceberg, or is this half the iceberg or three-quarters of the iceberg that we've seen to date?\" she asked.\n\nFive administration officials have reportedly stated that it is unlikely President Trump will extend the current guidelines beyond April 30. Instead, they expect the president to announce some easing of quarantine measures, although a full reopening of the country may not occur immediately.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has been in discussions with business leaders, including Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup, and Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, about supporting the economy and potential reopening timelines. These conversations have been facilitated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has fielded calls from executives like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, seeking guidance on when a semblance of normalcy might return.\n\nSome people close to the discussions have reported that Schwarzman and real estate investor Steven Roth have not been as aggressive in their push for reopening as others. Other business executives, such as Paul Tudor Jones and Nelson Peltz, have reportedly advocated for reopening the economy during conference calls organized by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nAs the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and public health advisers will need to balance the need for economic recovery with the ongoing threat of the virus. The discussions between the administration and business leaders will likely play a significant role in shaping the country's path forward.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Survives Early Test as Committee Votes Down Border Security Amendment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a bipartisan immigration bill has survived an early test as two Republican authors of the legislation joined forces with Democrats to vote down an amendment that aimed to strengthen border security provisions in the bill. The amendment, proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, would have required control of the U.S.-Mexico border for six months before anyone could seek legal status.\n\nSupporters of the legislation argue that the amendment, if passed, would have indefinitely delayed citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally. The amendment's real impact, according to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a lead supporter of the legislation, would be to \"delay, probably forever, any legalization\" for immigrants currently residing in the country without authorization, who would eventually be eligible for citizenship under the bill.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee vote to defeat the amendment was 12 to 6, with Republican Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina voting with Democrats. The four Republicans and four Democrats who authored the bill during months of closed-door negotiations, including Flake, Graham, Schumer, and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), are under scrutiny as the Judiciary Committee meets over the next two weeks. The focus is on whether they will hold together to defeat amendments from either side that could strike at the bill's core provisions.\n\nThe 844-page legislation aims to toughen border security, remake legal immigration to allow tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country, require all employers to check their workers' legal status, and create a 13-year path to citizenship for the millions already residing in the U.S.\n\nIn his opening remarks Thursday, Grassley charged that the landmark bill backed by President Barack Obama does little more than repeat mistakes of the past. \"It falls short of what I want to see in a strong immigration reform bill,\" Grassley said. \"You'll hear me say many times that we should not make the same mistakes that we made in 1986,\" he added, referring to the last time Congress passed a major immigration overhaul bill.\n\nSchumer countered that the legislation represents the country's best hope for immigration reform and a chance to break through the partisanship that's riven Congress and the country. \"We have come up with a fair bill where no one gets everything they want, but at the end of the day, it will mean dramatic improvement for the American economy, the American people, and will make our immigration policy much more in sync with what is good for jobs and America,\" Schumer said.\n\nSenators have filed some 300 amendments on a wide range of issues, including workplace enforcement, high-tech visas, and extending immigration law to cover gay people who are married. The focus Thursday was on border security. Although the bill allows citizenship to go forward only after certain border security goals have been met, those \"triggers\" have not proven convincing enough for many GOP lawmakers, and even one of the bill's authors, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), has said border measures need to be stronger.\n\nThe authors of the bill are working to show they are open to alterations that could attract additional support for the bill, and early on Thursday, they accepted a half-dozen uncontroversial amendments from the Republican side to boost enforcement provisions, including an amendment by Grassley to require annual audits of a new immigration reform trust fund.\n\nRubio conceded in a broadcast interview Thursday that some amendments could be seen as attempts to thwart the legislation, but added he thought most were intended to refine and improve it, saying \"that's the way the process is supposed to work.\" He called the work of the Gang of Eight \"an excellent starting point\" and said there is overwhelming support among the American people, including social conservatives, for immigration changes as long as they tighten border security. Rubio said in an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" that the public wants legislation that would ensure that \"this illegal immigration wave does not happen again.\"",
    " Title: \"Purdue University Leads Nationwide Experiment to Assess Critical Thinking Skills of College Students\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a groundbreaking initiative, Purdue University, under the leadership of President Mitch Daniels, has spearheaded a nationwide experiment to assess the critical thinking skills of college students. The experiment, which involves more than 125 professors from 59 institutions in nine states, aims to measure students' abilities in critical thinking, written communication, and quantitative literacy.\n\nThe project, initiated by the Association of American Colleges & Universities (AACU) and the State Higher Education Executive Officers, is a response to growing concerns about the effectiveness of higher education in developing critical thinking skills. The experiment is part of an effort to justify the high cost of attending college and address the declining percentage of Americans who view a college degree as \"very important.\"\n\nThe results of the experiment, released this week, show that while students are making progress in areas such as written communication and quantitative literacy, their critical thinking skills are lagging. Fewer than a third of students' finished assignments earned a high score for critical thinking, with less than half of their coursework drawing \"appropriate conclusions based on quantitative analysis of data.\"\n\nThe experiment, which involved judging 7,000 samples of students' classwork, is part of an effort to demonstrate that faculty can design assessments to measure real-world learning. The AACU took the offensive to show that faculty can define the generalized \"rubrics\" of what students should be learning, in response to the many attempts by \"outsiders\" to rank or rate schools for consumers of higher education.\n\nThe experiment, however, raises concerns about the state of critical thinking skills among college students. Despite the global reputation of American universities for excellence in teaching, the experiment shows that universities have only begun to demonstrate what they can produce in real-world learning. Knowledge-based degrees are still important, but given the pace of discoveries in many fields, employers are demanding advanced thinking skills from college graduates.\n\nIf faculty can now work with college presidents, government leaders, and others to accurately measure the intellectual worth of a college degree, more people may seek higher education and come out better thinkers. The experiment did not measure the work of students who have completed less than 75 percent of their coursework, leaving room for further study and improvement.",
    " Title: The Paradox of American Humanitarian Intervention: A Critical Examination of U.S. Military Involvement in Foreign Conflicts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a world where humanitarian intervention is often met with skepticism, the United States, a nation known for its generosity and selflessness, has found itself in a peculiar position. The latest example of this paradox can be seen in President Donald Trump's recent air strike on a Syrian airbase, a response to a nerve gas attack that moved the president's \"nobler impulses.\" However, this intervention, like many before it, has raised questions about the effectiveness and morality of using military force for humanitarian purposes.\n\nThe Syrian air strike is not an isolated incident. The United States has a long history of using its military for humanitarian intervention, a term that, as the article points out, has become a virtual oxymoron. From Operation Restore Hope in Somalia under President George H.W. Bush in 1992, aimed at alleviating a famine caused by civil war, to President Bill Clinton's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 in response to Serbian persecution of ethnic Albanians, the results have often been disastrous.\n\nIn Somalia, after a quarter-century of costly foreign intervention, the country remains Africa's most-failed state, plagued by war, terrorism, and famine. In Yugoslavia, the NATO air campaign spurred a frenzy of ethnic cleansing and resulted in the deaths of 500 Serbian civilians.\n\nThe Iraq War, initiated by President George W. Bush, was justified as a means of liberating the oppressed people of Iraq. However, the invasion unleashed deadly chaos that continues to this day. A 2013 study led by public health professor Amy Hagopian of the University of Washington concluded that the Iraq War and occupation caused nearly a half-million Iraqi deaths.\n\nIn Libya, President Barack Obama's intervention against dictator Moammar Gadhafi played a central role in turning the country into another failed state, a cauldron of anarchy and a hotbed of terrorists.\n\nPresident Trump's air raid on a Syrian airbase confirms the main thing Americans have learned from history: our leaders do not learn from history. The administration has made clear that as long as Assad limits himself to conventional forms of slaughter, he can expect to be left alone. However, if Trump were to expand our military involvement, the likely consequence would be more bloodshed rather than peace.\n\nIf the president were serious about humanitarian concerns, he would not be trying to cut the foreign aid budget, which has a better record than military force of actually helping the afflicted. Instead, he is lavishing money on efforts that have proved destructive while shorting those that have worked.\n\nPublic health efforts, such as the program initiated by George W. Bush to curb AIDS in Africa, have saved millions of lives through prevention and treatment. Yet, Trump proposes to cut U.S. funding for this program by $300 million this year.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the advantages of public health efforts over military intervention. These advantages include saving lives at a lower cost, making friends rather than enemies, and not causing innocent civilian casualties or shattering societies.\n\nIn a world where military solutions are often the preferred choice, it is crucial to remember the lessons of history and the potential consequences of our actions. As the article suggests, if the United States is truly committed to humanitarian intervention, it should focus on cost-effective, life-saving public health programs rather than military force.",
    " Title: Second Whistleblower Emerges in Trump-Ukraine Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the original whistleblower who sparked the inquiry, has announced that he is now representing a second whistleblower. This second individual, described as an intelligence official, has first-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint and has been interviewed by the head of the intelligence community's internal watchdog office, Michael Atkinson.\n\nThe existence of a second whistleblower, particularly one who can speak directly about events involving the president related to conversations involving Ukraine, could potentially undermine President Donald Trump's repeated claims that the original complaint, released on Sept. 26, was \"totally inaccurate.\" The original complaint alleged that Trump pressured a foreign power to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter, and that unnamed senior White House officials then tried to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call.\n\nAccording to the first whistleblower, more than a half-dozen U.S. officials have information relevant to the investigation, suggesting the probe could widen even further. The second whistleblower, while having spoken with the internal watchdog office, has not yet communicated with the congressional committees conducting the investigation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made brief remarks about the second whistleblower at a screening of the film \"The Great Hack\" in Los Angeles. Schiff expressed gratitude for the courage and patriotism of whistleblowers, emphasizing the crucial role they play in exposing wrongdoing.\n\nThe White House has maintained that Trump has done nothing wrong, with press secretary Stephanie Grisham stating on Sunday that \"it doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers about the same telephone call - a call the president already made public - it doesn't change the fact that he's done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe unfolding events in the impeachment inquiry continue to be a topic of intense interest and debate.

    " Title: \"Elizabeth Warren Proposes Return-Free Tax Filing System in the U.S., Aiming to Simplify Tax Preparation Process\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to streamline the tax preparation process for American citizens, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has reintroduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act. The legislation aims to enable the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop a return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download and fill out their tax forms using data the agency already has.\n\nThe proposed system, known as pre-populated tax returns or return-free filing, could save Americans a collective 225 million hours in preparation time and $2 billion in costs, according to one estimate. This system is already in practice in several countries, including Japan, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Spain.\n\nIn these countries, employers and banks provide the necessary tax information to the government, which then populates the taxpayer's return. Taxpayers can still dispute the numbers or further itemize their deductions, but for most, it would be a matter of signing off. In some of these countries, taxpayers don't even have to take any action if they accept the government's pre-populated return.\n\nThe idea of return-free filing is not new to the United States. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan called for Americans to \"not even have to fill out a return.\" The concept was also included in his Tax Reform Act.\n\nSen. Warren's bill, which has a number of cosponsors, including Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (NH), Tammy Baldwin (WI), Al Franken (MN), Tom Udall (NM), Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), Edward Markey (VT), Tammy Duckworth (IL), Maggie Hassan (NH), and Independent Bernie Sanders (VT), faces opposition from the tax preparation industry.\n\nLast year, H&R Block lobbied against Warren's bill and spent a total of $3 million lobbying the government, in part against return-free efforts. Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, spent over $2 million lobbying last year, with much of it spent in favor of legislation that would permanently block the government from offering these services.\n\nIntuit has lobbied against a number of past bills that would have allowed pre-prepared tax returns for many Americans\u2014and in favor of others that would have blocked the Treasury Department from starting return-free filing. Intuit has made it clear that any government filing option would threaten its business.\n\nThe tax preparation industry has spent nearly $28 million on lobbying since 1998. The lucrative nature of the industry is evident, as about 80 percent of taxpayers rely on a preparer or software to file their taxes, while they pay an average of $200 to tax preparation services a year, which eats up nearly 10 percent of the typical tax return.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Exchanges to Reopen with Increased Insurers and Improved Technology, but Concerns Remain over Consumer Costs and Choices\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the ObamaCare exchanges prepare to reopen next month, the Department of Health and Human Services has reported a 25 percent increase in the number of insurers, which officials argue will lower premium costs through competition and offer customers more choices. The report, released on Sept. 23, indicates that Americans shopping at the 36 federally-facilitated marketplaces can now choose from 248 qualified health plans, compared to 191 last year.\n\nThe report shows that 67 new insurers have joined the exchanges, but 10 have withdrawn, resulting in a net increase of 57. States under the federal program with the biggest increases were Indiana, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Texas, with four additional choices each. Eight states had zero additional choices, and no state had fewer choices.\n\nRep. Tom Price, a Georgia GOP member of the Congressional Health Care Caucus, acknowledged that ObamaCare has made some progress in reducing federal spending on uninsured Americans but expressed concerns about consumer costs remaining too high. He argued that the plans are not providing Americans with the coverage choices they want and need, with networks forcing people into places they don't want to go.\n\nThe report also included information on eight of the 14 state-run sites, showing 67 companies now offering insurance policies, compared to 61 in 2014. However, the additions are essentially existing, private insurance companies going into new states, not new companies offering policies for the first time, a source told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe massive problems faced by online ObamaCare shoppers when the exchanges debuted in October 2013, including system crashes, error messages, incorrect information, and lost applications, appear to have been largely fixed in the past 12 months. President Obama made sure the software problems were essentially fixed after the first several weeks by hiring industry experts to work around the clock to write better computer code and fix software bugs.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the technology's back end, which connects patients' insurance information to healthcare providers. Rep. Price argued that the front end of the computer system, which allows Americans to buy insurance online, might be largely improved, but the back end remains a \"terrible problem for doctors and hospitals.\"\n\nThe president crafted the legislation to help an estimated 30 million uninsured Americans get coverage. The 2010 law, officially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also offers financial assistance to Americans buying insurance through exchanges and made insurance available to people previously denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe administration reached its goal of enrolling 6 million people by its self-imposed March 31 deadline. Currently, 7.3 million people have enrolled in marketplace plans, paid their premiums, and have access to insurance, according to Sylvia Burwell, the agency director. Meanwhile, some states continue to struggle with their sites, most notably Oregon and Maryland.",
    " Title: White House Releases 2012 Taxpayer Receipt: Breakdown of Federal Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, the White House has released the 2012 Taxpayer Receipt, providing a detailed breakdown of how federal income tax revenues were spent. The release comes amid ongoing budget debates between the President, Democratic legislators, and their Republican counterparts.\n\nAccording to the White House, military operations and health care programs take up the bulk of federal income tax revenues. A married couple with one child making $50,000 a year, roughly the median household income in America, paid an average of $995 in federal income taxes in 2012, just 1.99%.\n\nNearly a quarter of income taxes, $245.17, went to the \"National Defense\" category. A slightly smaller sum, $223.38, or 22.45%, was spent on \"health care.\" Ongoing military operations, such as the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, swallow the largest sum of defense spending, accounting for more than 10% of taxpayer dollars, the White House said.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid, programs for the country's seniors and the poor, respectively, take up nearly all of the \"health care\" spending category in the income tax breakdown. This does not include the separate Medicare Tax of $725, or 1.45%, levied on the family used as an example.\n\nThe federal government spends comparatively little on education and the promotion of science and technology. Together, they all receive less than 5% of expenditures. This includes NASA's budget. A major exception is the development and construction of weapons technology, which weighs in at 7.62% of total federal expenditures.\n\nThe biggest tax by far is the workers' contributions to Social Security, which weigh in at $2,100 for a family of three earning a median income of $50,000 per year. That's 4.2% of the family's gross income and is more than its federal income and Medicare taxes taken together.\n\nOver the past 40 years, the federal budget deficit has amounted to 3.1% of gross domestic product per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Deficits are predicted to be slightly higher over the next 10 years, as rising health care and retirement costs increase federal spending, the budget office said.\n\nBudget deficits in the U.S. and much of the West surged with the onset of the world economic crisis in 2008, but began dropping in 2012, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. U.S. tax revenues\u2014including Social Security and Medicare\u2014have amounted to 18% of GDP over the past 40 years and are expected to rise slightly to 19% of annual GDP for the next 10 years, the budget office said.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte Caught in the Crossfire of National Gun Control Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nTILTON, N.H. \u2014 Senator Kelly Ayotte, a first-term Republican, has found herself at the epicenter of the nationwide gun control debate, following her vote against expanded background checks for commercial gun sales. The controversy, which has been simmering since the Senate's failed vote two weeks ago, has made New Hampshire a focal point in the ongoing national battle.\n\nDuring a recent town hall meeting, pro-gun control activists, who were in attendance, expressed their displeasure with Ayotte's stance. Two women attempted to approach Ayotte to discuss her vote, but were brushed aside by security, highlighting the ongoing controversy that surrounds the New Hampshire senator.\n\n\"It's a mixed reaction,\" Ayotte told reporters as she hurriedly exited the meeting. \"Something both sides feel strongly about.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Senate's failed vote, powerful outside groups, including those run by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have pledged to invest significant resources in New Hampshire. Their aim is to either persuade Ayotte to reverse her opposition to the bill or to face the political consequences of her stance.\n\nThe emotional debate threatens to redefine Ayotte, a young, conservative Republican woman whose political career has been marked by her focus on foreign policy and deficit hawkishness. Critics in the state have sought to portray her as \"NRAyotte\" in the wake of the gun control debate.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has responded with radio ads thanking Ayotte for her support.\n\nThe contentious issue risks transforming Ayotte, a senator representing a libertarian-minded state that is traditionally supportive of gun rights, into a polarizing figure. Polls indicate strong support for expanded background checks in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It hurts her,\" said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic operative and former head of the state party. \"Elections are won in New Hampshire with the vote of independents, particularly independent women. Independent women will not favor a candidate who does not believe in background checks. It will be an issue.\"\n\nAyotte, seemingly eager to move past the controversy, appears to be adopting a lower profile on the gun control issue. However, her stance may continue to be a point of contention in the upcoming elections, potentially impacting her political future.",
    " Title: Trump and Clinton Trade Economic Policy Barbs as Campaigns Gear Up\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange of political rhetoric, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have engaged in a verbal sparring match over their respective economic policies.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Detroit on Monday, Trump unveiled his new tax plan, promising to revitalize the American economy. The GOP nominee maintained his composure despite interruptions from protesters, staying focused on his economic vision for the nation.\n\nSpeaking at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump outlined his plans for America's economy, stating, \"We will make America grow again. I want to jump-start America, and it can be done, and it won't even be that hard.\"\n\nTrump's plan includes cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets from the current seven to just three. He also proposed reducing taxes on businesses, as the U.S. has the highest corporate tax among major nations. Additionally, Trump suggested allowing parents to fully deduct the cost of child care from their taxable income.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump also took aim at Clinton's economic plans, accusing her of penalizing Americans for working and doing business in the United States.\n\nClinton swiftly responded, criticizing Trump's economic proposals as a repackaging of old Republican ideas. Speaking at a campaign rally in Kissimmee, Florida, she said, \"Today in Detroit, he's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named. Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve. They wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. They tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new.\"\n\nClinton emphasized her commitment to being a \"small business president\" and creating jobs, stating, \"If Trump were able to implement what he's proposing, heaven forbid, it would cost three and a half million jobs. He would actually reduce jobs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the latest round of national polls shows Clinton leading her GOP rival by double digits. However, Trump's hour-long speech on a key issue - the economy - could be a sign that the Republican candidate is ready to work with the GOP to get his campaign back on track.",
    " Title: Hope Hicks Returns to White House as Trump Surrounds Himself with Loyal Aides\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hope Hicks, one of President Donald Trump's most trusted and longest-serving aides, is returning to the White House as the president works to surround himself with loyalists as his reelection campaign moves into high gear.\n\nHicks, a former White House communications director who was one of Trump's original 2016 campaign staffers, is expected to serve as counselor to the president, working with presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. According to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity before the announcement had been made public, she left the White House in 2018 and moved to California to work as a top executive at the Fox Corporation, though she and Trump remained in touch.\n\nHicks' move comes just one week after Trump was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges. Since then, he's been on a tear to clear his administration of those he sees as insufficiently loyal, including ousting staffers at the national security council and state department and pulling the nomination of a top treasury department pick who had overseen cases involving Trump's former aides as U.S. Attorney. More departures are expected in the coming days, including at the shrinking foreign policy arm of the White House, where Trump's national security adviser has been pushing for months to cull staff.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has been working to surround himself with longtime aides he believes he can trust as he heads into what is expected to be a bruising general election campaign to remain in the White House. In addition to Hicks, Trump recently brought back John McEntee, another longtime staffer who began on the 2016 campaign as an intern and rose to become one of Trump's closest staffers, with an office adjacent to the Oval Office. McEntee had served as Trump's personal aide until he was forced out of the White House in 2018 on the orders of former chief of staff John Kelly over issues with his security clearance.\n\nMcEntee has now been tapped to lead the White House Presidential Personnel Office, an influential posting that coordinates the screening and hiring of thousands of federal government workers. As part of that mission, he is expected to work to ensure that only those who believe in Trump's mission are offered jobs.\n\n\"This is bringing back Ringo and John and Paul and George,\" said Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign, referring to the members of the super group \"The Beatles.\"\n\n\"This is putting the band back together for what is probably going to be the most consequential and important concert of their lives,\" he said, noting that the people being brought back into the fold \"are people that understand Trump as a person, who understand President Trump's priorities, who he likes personally\" and who \"are going to spend every waking moment of their lives trying to help him.\"\n\nIn her new role, Hicks will not be part of the White House communications department, but will work closely with Kushner and White House political director Brian Jack \"in a number of strategic areas,\" according to a White House official. She is expected to start early next month, though details were still being worked out Thursday.\n\nKnown for her loyalty and low public profile, Hicks was part of the small inner circle that traveled the country with Trump aboard his private jet as he waged his unlikely campaign for the Republican nomination and then the presidency in 2015 and 2016. She was often described as someone who was especially deft at reading the president's moods and helping others navigate his instincts.\n\nTrump never wanted Hicks to leave the White House, which she chose to do as she was called to testify before lawmakers and the special counsel's office during the Russia investigation. And she and the president remained in regular touch while she was at Fox, with the president trying to convince her to return to the White House since nearly the day she left, according to one of the people. The president's sales pitch, the person said, intensified in recent months amid impeachment.\n\nThe news of her decision was praised publicly by top administration officials, including Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary who also serves as the current White House communications director.\n\n\"I have worked with Hope for almost six years and can say without hesitation she is one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have come across,\" Grisham said in a statement. \"She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty, and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.\"\n\n\"There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks,\" Kushner added. \"We are excited to have her back on the team.\"\n\nEven before Trump's acquittal, his national security adviser Robert O'Brien had been working to shrink the ranks at the National Security Council, where Alexander Vindman, the director for European Affairs, had worked before he was escorted out of the White House last week. O'Brien said the streamlining will be completed by the end of the week, with about 70 fewer staffers than the 115 to 120 staffers when he started the job in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative Newsmax TV announced Thursday that Trump's first press secretary, Sean Spicer, will be hosting a political talk show that will air weeknights at 6 p.m. from Washington. \"Spicer & Co.\" will debut on March 3.",
    " Title: President Trump's First Overseas Trip as Commander-in-Chief: A Comprehensive Itinerary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump embarks on his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief today, with a multi-destination journey spanning the Middle East and Europe. The trip, which begins on Friday, includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, NATO's 28th summit in Brussels, Belgium, and the 43rd G7 summit in Taormina, Italy.\n\nThe trip follows a series of high-profile controversies, most recently the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. Here's a breakdown of the president's planned itinerary:\n\nIn Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump will attend an arrival ceremony, followed by meetings with King Salman and members of the royal family, a royal banquet, and the signing of several agreements to strengthen U.S.-Saudi security and economic cooperation. Trump and the First Lady will dine with the Saudi royal family, and he will address leaders of Muslim countries on the need to combat radical ideology.\n\nTraveling to Israel, Trump will meet with President Reuven Rivlin, lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, a Holocaust memorial, and deliver remarks at the Israeli Museum. He will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and attend a private dinner with the Netanyahus.\n\nIn Bethlehem, Trump will meet Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas and express his administration's desire to facilitate an agreement ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He will visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, where he will pray.\n\nAt the Vatican, Trump will meet Pope Francis, tour St. Peter's, and meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella. He will also meet King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, as well as Prime Minister Charles Michel. Trump will later meet with the presidents of the European Union and the European Council.\n\nAt the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron and deliver remarks at the unveiling of a NATO memorial, reaffirming the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance. He will attend a meeting and dinner with NATO leaders.\n\nTrump will then travel to the 43rd G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily, where he will advocate for his economic agenda and call for increased security cooperation. He will attend a dinner hosted by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and speak to U.S. troops at Sigonella Naval Air Station before returning to the U.S.\n\nThis comprehensive itinerary underscores President Trump's commitment to strengthening alliances, addressing global conflicts, and promoting economic growth during his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief.",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Urge Senate Action on Fiscal Cliff Legislation as Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement Wednesday, House Republican leaders called on the Senate to act first on legislation aimed at averting the fiscal cliff, indicating they would not reconvene the House until the Senate passes a bill through its chamber. The statement, signed by House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, stated that if the Senate does not approve and send the bills to the president for signing, they must be amended and returned to the House.\n\nThe statement read, \"Once this has occurred, the House will then consider whether to accept the bills as amended, or to send them back to the Senate with additional amendments. The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate must act first.\"\n\nSenate Democrats responded later Wednesday, urging House Republicans to pass a bill that would extend tax rates for income below $250,000. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, \"The Senate bill could pass tomorrow if House Republicans would simply let it come to the floor.\"\n\nThe call for action comes as a stalemate over the fiscal cliff persists. House Republican leadership held a conference call Wednesday, with all House Republican lawmakers set to have a conference call with leadership on Thursday. The call was limited to top GOP leaders, not the full House Republican conference, according to several sources. No decisions were made on the call.\n\nWith tax rates set to rise on all income levels and federal spending cuts set to take effect, the GOP position is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs to move a bill to avert the fiscal cliff or else he is abdicating his duties. Top Republicans also need to discuss whether to bring the House into session. GOP leadership has promised lawmakers a 48-hour warning if they decide to convene, meaning the earliest the House could reconvene would be Friday, if the warning was given Wednesday. However, weather in Washington is poor, and it is the height of the holiday travel season, making it possible for the House to return before January 1.\n\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also warned Congressional leadership Wednesday that the nation's statutory borrowing cap would be hit on December 31. \"Extraordinary measures\" would allow the federal government to continue borrowing money for two months, but the fiscal cliff standoff throws even that calculation into flux.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 29: A Controversial Tobacco Tax Initiative Amid Budget Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 29, a tobacco tax initiative aimed at curbing smoking and raising funds for cancer research, is facing a tough battle at the ballot box amidst the state's financial crisis. The proposition, if passed, would impose a significant increase on cigarette taxes, generating an estimated $735 million annually.\n\nChris Lehman, one of the organizers behind the initiative, expressed his disappointment over California's declining status as a leading anti-smoking state. He stated, \"You think of California as a healthy, progressive state leading in tobacco cessation, but it's just not. And it's not for lack of trying.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society, a key contributor to the proposition, has invested more than $7 million in its passage. The society, along with other health organizations, argues that raising the cost of tobacco is the most effective way to discourage smoking, particularly among teenagers.\n\nHowever, the proposition's timing has raised eyebrows, as California grapples with a $16 billion budget deficit. Governor Jerry Brown announced the deficit last month, proposing severe spending cuts to address it. The $735 million raised from the tobacco tax would not be used to close the deficit, according to the proposition's organizers.\n\nOpponents argue that the proposition's timing is inappropriate, given the state's financial woes. Michael C. Genest, a former director of finance for the state, noted the irony of a major tax increase with no budget allocation during a time of severe budget cuts.\n\nCalifornia's cigarette tax currently stands at 87 cents, half the national average, and ranks 33rd in the nation. The state is one of only three states that have not raised the cigarette tax over the past decade. About 12 percent of Californians now smoke.\n\nOpponents of the proposition have criticized the lack of legislative oversight and the potential for funds to be used out of state. Philip Morris USA and the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company are the leading contributors behind the effort to defeat Proposition 29, with the California Republican Party also contributing around $1 million.\n\nSupporters of the proposition, including former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, argue that the funds raised could significantly contribute to cancer research and prevention efforts. However, the proposition's passage requires a simple majority from the voters, unlike the two-thirds vote required for other tax increases in California.\n\nThe debate over Proposition 29 highlights the complexities of balancing public health initiatives with fiscal responsibility in times of economic hardship. As the election approaches, the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: President Obama Criticizes Donald Trump as Unfit for Presidency, Citing Unprecedented Campaign and Divisive Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare move, President Barack Obama on Tuesday publicly declared Donald Trump as \"unfit\" to serve as president, urging Republican leaders to reconsider their support for their party's presidential nominee. During a press conference at the White House with Singapore's prime minister, Obama questioned the suitability of Trump as a potential successor, stating, \"If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?\"\n\nThe criticism stemmed from Trump's recent remarks about the Muslim parents of a U.S. Army officer who was killed in the Iraq War. Obama asked, \"What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer?\" He further emphasized that Trump's divisive comments are not isolated incidents but a consistent pattern.\n\nRep. Richard Hanna, a retiring congressman from New York, became the first GOP lawmaker to announce he would vote for Hillary Clinton following Obama's remarks. Hanna cited Trump's comments on the Khan family as the reason for his decision.\n\nIn response, Trump released a statement criticizing Obama and Clinton for their handling of the economy, foreign policy, and the Iran nuclear deal. He also criticized Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of State, stating it put national security at risk.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump escalated last week following his feud with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of the soldier. Trump's comments about their religion and his suggestion that Ghazala Khan's initial silence was due to her faith drew widespread criticism.\n\nTrump has since responded to the Khans' comments, stating in an interview with ABC News that he had sacrificed by building his business and suggesting that Ghazala Khan's silence was due to her religion. In a Monday night interview on Fox News, Trump said, \"His son died 12 years ago, and if I were president, his son would not have died because I would not have been in the war, if I was president back then.\"\n\nWhile no other GOP leaders have dropped their endorsement of Trump, Hanna's decision to vote for Clinton highlights the growing divide within the Republican Party. Hanna told The Syracuse Post Standard, \"I think Trump is a national embarrassment. Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?\"",
    " Title: Former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III Discusses Clinton Email Investigation Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Fox News, former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III has revealed that he, his family, and his staff faced intense backlash during the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016, with the Clinton campaign reportedly planning to fire him if she won the election.\n\nMcCullough, who was appointed by the Obama administration, discussed his role in the Clinton email probe for the first time on television during an interview on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" He shed light on how the probe was politicized and his office was marginalized by Democrats.\n\nIn January 2016, after McCullough informed the Republican leadership on the Senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that emails beyond the \"Top Secret\" level passed through Clinton's unsecured personal server, the backlash intensified. McCullough recalled, \"All of a sudden I became a shill of the right. And I was told by members of Congress, \u2018Be careful. You're losing your credibility. You need to be careful. There are people out to get you.' \"\n\nMcCullough, who was responsible for the 17 intelligence agencies, said the executive who recommended him to the Obama administration for the job, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, was also disturbed by the independent Clinton email findings. Clapper's comments came during an in-person meeting about a year before the presidential election, according to McCullough.\n\nAfter the Clapper meeting, McCullough said his team was marginalized. \"I was told by senior officials to keep [Clapper] out of it,\" he said, while acknowledging he tried to keep his boss in the loop.\n\nAs one of the few people who viewed the 22 top-secret Clinton emails deemed too classified to release under any circumstances, the former IG said, \"There was a very good reason to withhold those emails... there would have been harm to national security. \" McCullough went further, telling Fox News that \"sources and methods, lives and operations\" could be put at risk.\n\nSome of those email exchanges contained Special Access Program (SAP) information characterized by intel experts as \"above top secret.\" WikiLeaks documents show the campaign was formulating talking points as the review of 30,000 Clinton emails was ongoing.\n\nMcCullough was critical of the campaign's response, as the classified review had barely begun. \"There was an effort... certainly on the part of the campaign, to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to see here,\" McCullough said.\n\nIn March 2016, seven senior Democrats sent a letter to McCullough and his State Department counterpart, raising serious questions about the impartiality of the Clinton email review. However, McCullough was not making the decisions on what material in Clinton's emails was classified\u2014he was passing along the findings of the individual agencies who got the intelligence and have final say on classification.\n\n\"I think there was certainly a coordinated strategy,\" McCullough said.\n\nMcCullough described one confrontation with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office just six weeks before the election, amid pressure to respond to the letter\u2014which Feinstein had co-signed. \"I thought that any response to that letter would just hyper-politicize the situation,\" McCullough said. \"I recall even offering to resign, to the staff director. I said, \u2018Tell [Feinstein] I'll resign tonight. I'd be happy to go. I'm not going to respond to that letter. It's just that simple.' \"\n\nAs Election Day approached, McCullough said the threats went further, singling out him and another senior government investigator on the email case. \"It was told in no uncertain terms, by a source directly from the campaign, that we would be the first two to be fired\u2014with [Clinton's] administration. That that was definitely going to happen,\" he said.\n\nMcCullough said he was just trying to do his job, which requires independence. \"I was, in this context, a whistleblower. I was explaining to Congress\u2014I was doing exactly what they had expected me to do. Exactly what I promised them I would do during my confirmation hearing,\" he said. \"... This was a political matter, and all of a sudden I was the enemy.\"\n\nHe said pressures also increased early on from Clinton's former team at the State Department, especially top official Patrick Kennedy. \"State Department management didn't want us there,\" McCullough said. \"We knew we had had a security problem at this point. We had a possible compromise.\"\n\nSpeaking about the case more than a year after the FBI probe concluded, McCullough in his interview also addressed the possibility that a more cooperative State Department and Clinton campaign might have precluded the FBI's involvement from the start. \"Had they come in with the server willingly, without having us to refer this to the bureau... maybe we could have worked with the State Department,\" he said.\n\nMore than 2,100 classified emails passed through Clinton's personal server, which was used exclusively for government business. No one has been charged. Asked what would have happened to him if he had done such a thing, McCullough said, \"I'd be sitting in Leavenworth right now.\"\n\nFox News asked a Clinton campaign spokesman, Feinstein's office, and Clapper for comment. There was no immediate response.",
    " Title: Wisconsin and Minnesota Primaries Set Stage for Tight Congressional Races in Key Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the upcoming midterm elections, voters in the key battleground states of Wisconsin and Minnesota chose their nominees on Tuesday, setting the stage for tight races in November.\n\nIn Wisconsin, state senator Leah Vukmir emerged victorious in the Republican primary to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, according to an Associated Press projection. The state, which helped secure Republican Donald Trump's surprising presidential win in 2016, could serve as a barometer of Democratic strength ahead of the midterms.\n\nRepublicans also selected Bryan Steil, a former aide to House Speaker Paul Ryan, to replace Ryan in his seat in southeast Wisconsin. Steil will face Randy Bryce, an ironworker known as \"Iron Stache,\" in a suburban Milwaukee district that Democrats covet.\n\nIn the gubernatorial race, Wisconsin Democrats selected Tony Evers, the state schools chief, to challenge incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. The outcome of Walker's challenge will be closely watched as another measure of Democratic intensity.\n\nMeanwhile, in Minnesota, state senator Karen Housley was chosen by Republicans to take on Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Tina Smith, appointed after former Senator Al Franken resigned last year amid sexual harassment accusations.\n\nPrimaries in two House districts representing regions affected by Trump's trade policies could play a key role in determining control of Congress. Former state representative Joe Radinovich outlasted a bevy of Democrats in an open-seat race in the state's northeastern mining region, which has seen some benefit from the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs. In the state's south, Republican Jim Hagedorn defeated Carla Nelson in a district the party hopes to seize after the Democratic incumbent, Tim Walz, ran for governor.\n\nBeyond the Upper Midwest, Connecticut and Vermont also held primaries on Tuesday. In Vermont, unofficial results showed Christine Hallquist as the first openly transgender person to win a major U.S. party nomination for statewide office in the Democratic governor's primary. Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate, easily won that state's Democratic Senate primary. However, Sanders, as before, is expected to decline the nomination and run as an independent.",
    " Title: The Republican Party Faces an Identity Crisis as Trump's Presumptive Nomination Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is grappling with an identity crisis as Donald Trump's strong performance in the Super Tuesday primaries puts him on a path towards the Republican presidential nomination. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's victories on the Democratic side all but secure her own nomination.\n\nThe transformation of the Republican Party, according to Republican strategist Ford O'Connell, is a result of Trump's appeal to a broad base of voters, many of whom are longtime Republicans and others who are new to politics. This shift is causing concern among party leaders, who see Trump's message and policies as a departure from traditional Republican values.\n\nTrump's positions on social issues, such as his call for mass deportations of illegal immigrants, and his incendiary rhetoric, are particularly troubling for Republican leaders. They fear that Trump's image as a divisive and intolerant candidate could alienate large segments of the electorate, such as Hispanics and African Americans, and harm the party's chances in future elections.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, in a rare public statement, spoke out against Trump's recent controversy, stating that the Republican Party does not \"prey on people's prejudices, but appeals to their highest ideals.\" Ryan, like most Republican elected officials, has pledged to support the party's nominee, but some cracks in the fa\u00e7ade of party unity are beginning to show.\n\nFreshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) has publicly stated that he will never vote for Trump, and if Trump wins the nomination, Sasse says he will look for a third-party candidate. Retiring Rep. Scott Rigell (R-VA) also issued an open letter rejecting Trump as a potential nominee, citing concerns about his judgment, temperament, and character.\n\nHowever, on Capitol Hill, no other Republican has joined Sasse's call for a third-party option. Most leading party members are lying low and hoping that Trump can be thwarted. To date, only Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) has endorsed Trump, and he faces stiff competition from other candidates, including Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz's victories on Tuesday position him as Trump's main opponent going forward, but even that presents a challenge to mainstream Republican leaders. Cruz is a loyal conservative, but his hard-line, no-compromise style has alienated most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate. In a nomination race between Trump and Cruz, some Republican activists prefer Trump, seeing him as somewhat more electable in November than Cruz.\n\nIn any case, it will be difficult for Cruz to knock Trump off his path to the nomination. Some Republicans say that, given the still-large field of five candidates, including Ben Carson, the GOP establishment's best hope is for no candidate to reach the Republican National Convention with the majority of delegates required to secure the nomination. In that event, party leaders would hope to win over enough delegates for a candidate they view as more electable against Clinton, likely Rubio.\n\nHowever, Trump has the momentum, and if he's the nominee, Republicans face ominous signs that he could have a hard time getting the turnout he needs to win. In the exit polls from Super Tuesday contests, among voters who did not support Trump, three-fourths said they would not be satisfied with him as the nominee. That raises the question of whether such voters would even turn out, or if they did, vote for the Democrat.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Tensions Escalate: Potential Consequences and Global Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have intensified, leading to a significant drop in global markets on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 700 points, with the Dow recovering slightly before the end of trading, closing at a loss of 572 points.\n\nThe escalation began when President Donald Trump announced a possible expansion of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods by $100 billion, adding to the $50 billion in tariffs already imposed in response to intellectual property concerns in China and $3 billion in tariffs on aluminum and steel imports.\n\nChina has already announced retaliation for the first $53 billion in U.S. tariffs and could be expected to respond to the next $100 billion, though this would nearly equal total U.S. exports to China. The trade war has raised concerns among trade groups in Washington and GOP lawmakers, who have expressed alarm at the back-and-forth.\n\nWhite House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow, a former CNBC host and free-trade advocate, insisted that the U.S. is not in a trade war, but rather attempting to \"right some of the wrongs\" with respect to China. However, the sense that the trade war is intensifying has mounted, with some lawmakers and economists expressing concern about the potential consequences.\n\nRepublicans have been scrambling to find a middle ground between Trump's aggressive trade stance and the party's free-trade orthodoxy. Some lawmakers have criticized the tariffs as misguided economic policy, while others have expressed support for the president's efforts to address trade challenges head-on.\n\nThe expanding list of potential tariffs has opened the possibility that China could find new ways to strike back at the U.S. Goldman Sachs chief U.S. political economist Alec Phillips warned of potential complications, including foreign exchange and currency reactions, the possibility of China selling off some of its treasury holdings, and difficulties for U.S. financial, travel, and other services industries operating in China.\n\nThe Asian giant could also seek to make it difficult for U.S. financial, travel, and other services industries to operate in China, where the U.S. has a $38 billion trade surplus in services. China has criticized Trump for the sanctions and has sought to close ranks with the European Union, which has also criticized Trump over steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on imports around the globe.\n\nThe trade war between the world's two largest economies has raised concerns about the global economy and the potential for a prolonged trade conflict. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the trade tensions could shave 0.8% off global growth by 2020, while the World Bank has warned that the trade tensions could push an additional 9 million people into extreme poverty.\n\nAs the trade war continues to escalate, both the U.S. and China will need to carefully consider the potential consequences and work towards a resolution that benefits both economies and the global economy as a whole.",
    " Title: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Announces Support for Iran Nuclear Deal, Citing Confidence in Enhanced Security for Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, has announced her support for the Iran nuclear deal. In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" she expressed her decision, stating that the deal's opponents have failed to provide evidence that an alternative plan would be effective.\n\nWasserman Schultz, who represents a largely Jewish constituency, also penned an op-ed in the Miami Herald on Sunday, calling the decision \"the most difficult\" she has had to make in her nearly 23 years in elected office. She emphasized her commitment to Israel's security, stating, \"I am a Jewish mother... There\u2019s nothing more important to me as a Jew than to ensure that Israel\u2019s existence is there throughout generations.\"\n\nThe White House is closely monitoring Wasserman Schultz's decision, as her vote is seen as influential among Democrats. She revealed that she spoke with President Barack Obama on Saturday, and he assured her that she would be part of a group working with the administration to develop an enhanced security package for Israel and tighten the ability to enforce the deal.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, which secures enough votes in the Senate to allow President Obama to implement the pact, has been a contentious issue, particularly among Jewish lawmakers. Vice President Joe Biden met with Jewish leaders in South Florida last week, urging them to support the deal, which he argued would strengthen the U.S.'s position in addressing concerns from Israel and Arab states regarding Iran's regional behavior.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, criticized the Iran agreement, calling it a \"major, major defeat\" and comparing it to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the lead-up to World War II. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Colin Powell described the deal as \"a pretty good deal\" on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing the halt in Iran's nuclear program as a significant achievement.\n\nThe debate over the Iran nuclear deal continues, with opponents arguing that it leaves open a potential future lane for Iran to rev up its nuclear program, while proponents, like Wasserman Schultz, emphasize the deal's potential to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threshold state and to focus on Iran's terrorist activities.",
    " Title: Kavanaugh's Confirmation to the Supreme Court: A Political Reality for Vulnerable Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court appears to be a near certainty, given the current political landscape. With the Republican party holding a slim majority in the Senate, attracting enough Republicans to vote against Kavanaugh seems increasingly unlikely. Senators such as Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have shown no signs of deviating from their party line.\n\nDemocratic activists have been urging Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to pressure vulnerable Democrats, including Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN), to vote against Kavanaugh. However, such a move would be politically risky, as these senators hail from states that President Trump won by robust margins in the 2016 election.\n\nIf these senators were to vote against Kavanaugh, they could face a backlash from voters, who might be swayed by the president's campaigning against their opponents in the upcoming midterms. Conversely, if they support Kavanaugh, Trump is likely to campaign vigorously for their Republican opponents.\n\nThe concerns about Kavanaugh's potential impact on issues such as Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act are valid, but the unpredictable nature of the Supreme Court makes it difficult to predict the exact outcomes of his rulings. The potential for Chief Justice John Roberts to adjust his behavior in response to a more conservative court is a speculative possibility.\n\nThe defeat of these three vulnerable Democrats could significantly weaken the Democratic party's influence in the Senate, making it more difficult to thwart President Trump's legislative agenda. This could be particularly significant if the Democrats were to gain control of the House in the upcoming midterms.\n\nIn the eyes of many Democratic party activists, a vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation by these senators would be a political compromise. However, it is unrealistic to expect politicians to risk their careers in a losing cause. Senate Minority Leader Schumer must balance the demands of party loyalists with the political realities of the current political climate.\n\nRoss K. Baker, a distinguished professor of political science at Rutgers University and a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors, echoes this sentiment. \"It is not worth the loss of seats that will cost his party current influence and move it further away from a future majority,\" he tweeted (@Rosbake1).",
    " Title: Trump's Speeches and Tweets: A Week of Controversies, Exaggerations, and Factual Inaccuracies\n\nIn the past week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has faced scrutiny for several inaccurate statements made during his speeches and tweets. This article examines some of the most notable falsehoods and exaggerations Trump has made in the past seven days.\n\n\"When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.\" - 28 June, Monessen, Pennsylvania\n\nIn 2015, five US steelmakers complained about Chinese producers receiving government subsidies and flouting import rules. This spring, the Obama administration imposed a 522% tariff on the Chinese companies, and the US International Trade Commission also announced an investigation into aluminum imports, hinting at more tariffs on the Chinese.\n\nFact-check: Donald Trump on trade, globalization, and the Clintons (Politifact)\n\n\"Today, we import nearly $800bn more in goods than we export.\" - 28 June, Monessen, Pennsylvania\n\nTrump's statement is not entirely accurate. The US's 2015 deficit on goods was indeed $762.6bn. However, the US is a service economy, and last year it had a surplus in its service trade, which, with other market forces, drove the overall trade deficit down to about $500bn, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump himself outsources manufacturing to China and Bangladesh, making suits and ties there and importing them to the US.\n\n\"Our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians, believe me.\" - 28 June, Monessen, Pennsylvania\n\nThe men who led the young United States in the 1790s and early 1800s likely understood trade better than at least one current politician, but they understood it in a world of slavery, plantations, and New England shipping. Even then, Trump's trade ideas would not have necessarily been welcome; the founders had vicious disagreements over it.\n\nTrump invoked Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln to argue for tariffs as a means of protecting American manufacturing. Hamilton supported tariffs to protect a young manufacturing economy, while Thomas Jefferson largely opposed them, realizing that they would empower northern businessmen over the farming, slave-holding south. Lincoln similarly supported tariffs to protect northern industry, which was then violently at odds with the south. However, by the late 19th century, tariffs had become tools of powerful tycoons, who could impose high prices on goods on the poor and middle class. Their power was reduced by the income tax and other reforms of the early 20th century. Automation and globalization have further complicated trade in the 100 years since.\n\n\"It was also Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.\" - 28 June, Monessen, Pennsylvania\n\nIn 2007, Republican George W. Bush signed the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, but Congress refused to ratify it for nearly five years. Barack Obama warned of employment consequences from the deal in 2008, but argued it would boost the shattered economy after he became president. Clinton opposed the deal and a candidate but supported it as Obama's secretary of state. However, to say she \"shoved\" it on the US is an exaggeration, considering its steady support from Republicans and centrist Democrats.\n\nThe US International Trade Commission predicted the agreement would have a \"negligible\" effect on jobs in the US, and its net effect is difficult to gauge. In May, the US Trade Representative reported export increases of 8.4% since 2011, and a net gain in manufacturing jobs \u2013 though this is likely tied to the general recovery rather than the deal.\n\n\"We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.\" - 25 June, Twitter\n\nOver several months, Trump has contradicted or reinvented his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. In December, he proposed \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\" In May, he called that \"just a suggestion.\" On 13 June, he said it would apply to regions \"where there is a proven history of terrorism\" and \"Islamic terror\"; on 25 June, he said British Muslims \" wouldn't bother\" him but those from \"terror countries\" would; and then on 27 June, his campaign claimed nothing had changed.\n\nThe US has one of the most arduous refugee acceptance programs in the world, a 18-months to two-year process that involves vetting by the UN and multiple US security agencies, fingerprint and medical checks, and in-person interviews. Trump regularly ignores the existence of this strict vetting system.\n\n\"Don't know anything about him.\" - 25 June, Aberdeen, Scotland, about George W. Bush's treasury secretary, Hank Paulson\n\nTrump professed ignorance after a reporter asked him about the Republican leader who endorsed Clinton in an op-ed last week. However, in 2008, Trump praised Paulson by name in an interview with CNN, which was unearthed by BuzzFeed. \"I think Paulson, I would give an A, because he really took something very strong,\" Trump said, speaking about the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe businessman frequently claims ignorance when confronted with something uncomfortable, even when he has spoken at length about that person or topic. \"I know nothing about David Duke.\" the candidate said in February, after the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan endorsed him. Trump had disavowed Duke two days earlier, and in 2000 had called Duke \"a Klansman\" and described him as \"not company I wish to keep.\"",
    " Title: Major Anti-Trump Groups Focus on Indiana as Key Battleground in Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Republican presidential race, Indiana is emerging as a critical state for anti-Trump groups, as conservative donors view it as a crucial step in preventing Donald Trump from securing the party's nomination. Doug Sachtleben, spokesman for the well-funded anti-Trump super-PAC, Club for Growth Action (CFGA), stated that the group has already invested over $1.7 million in Indiana, primarily on statewide television advertising opposing Trump.\n\n\"We believe Ted Cruz must win and will win Indiana,\" Sachtleben said, adding that the CFGA's Indiana ad, titled \"Math,\" argues that a vote for John Kasich divides the Republican field, helping Trump. The Kasich campaign has, in essence, endorsed this message, withdrawing from competing in Indiana, effectively ceding the state to Cruz.\n\nThree other significant Republican-aligned anti-Trump groups are concentrating their efforts in Indiana to halt Trump's momentum. Katie Packer, chairwoman of Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group backed by GOP mega-donors such as billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer and the Ricketts family, has stated that the group will spend at least $1 million in Indiana opposing Trump. Our Principles PAC has already spent over $16 million opposing Trump in primary and caucus states.\n\n\"We have a full-court press going there,\" Packer said on Wednesday. \"It's a pretty comprehensive TV buy that is in place statewide. We have got a full mail program, digital \u2014 it's really the scope of what we did in Wisconsin.\"\n\nIndiana holds a winner-take-most contest, with the statewide winner receiving 30 delegates, and 27 more being awarded through winner-take-all contests in each congressional district. Trump currently stands at 987 delegates, according to the Associated Press delegate tracker, and needs fewer than 50 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination. Both Cruz and Kasich are mathematically unable to reach that mark without a contested convention.\n\nA Trump victory in Indiana could leave him needing as little as 43 percent of the remaining delegates, and a total loss would leave him needing 56 percent. While Trump is seen as a lock for New Jersey's 51 winner-take-all delegates, the remaining contests offer few options for Trump to amass delegates outside of Indiana and California.\n\nThe anti-Trump movement's fervent hope is that Trump's delegate accumulation can be slowed in Indiana and ultimately stopped short in the June 7 California primary. If Cruz and the anti-Trump forces can keep Trump from the 1,237 mark and convince unbound delegates not to push him over that threshold on the convention's first ballot, it would reset the contest. Cruz has been successful in winning the loyalties of delegates, including those bound to Trump, and after the first ballot, the majority of them would be free to vote their conscience.",
    " Title: Enforcement of Gun Laws: A Focus on Prosecutions and the Straw Purchase Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of ongoing discussions regarding gun violence and gun control, the federal government has launched a campaign to discourage individuals with clean criminal records from purchasing firearms for felons who are legally prohibited from doing so. The campaign, which is being broadcast on radio and billboard ads nationwide, urges potential gun buyers to \"don't lie for the other guy.\"\n\nThis initiative comes as part of a broader push in Washington for new gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on military-style rifles and large ammunition magazines. However, recent studies have shown that the Obama administration has not enforced many existing gun laws effectively.\n\nAccording to a study by Syracuse University, federal gun crime prosecutions hit a decade low in 2011, down 40% from their peak under President George W. Bush in 2004. This has prompted 23 House Republicans to call on President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute more people for gun-related crimes.\n\nThe Syracuse study reveals a significant drop in federal weapons prosecutions, from about 11,000 in 2004 to about 6,000 in 2011, and a slight increase to 7,770 in 2012. The GOP letter also cites data from the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), which shows that of the 6 million Americans who applied to buy a gun in 2010, less than 2% were denied. Of those denied, only 44 were prosecuted, and only 13 were punished for lying or buying a gun illegally.\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has criticized the current administration's approach, stating, \"If the prosecution of people lying on forms is really a priority for the president, then all he has to do is say, 'I want my federal law enforcement officials to prosecute these kinds of cases.' Obviously, there is a different level of priority given to these types of crimes in this administration compared with other administrations.\"\n\nJustice Department sources argue that the Attorney General has limited resources and prefers to prosecute prohibited persons who have managed to obtain guns illegally, rather than those who merely lie on the form. A source also noted that \"lie and try\" cases, where individuals are prosecuted for lying on a form but ultimately denied the ability to purchase a gun, have little jury appeal due to the questionable harm caused by the individual not obtaining the gun.\n\nProsecutions for making false statements when buying a gun are down 29% over the past five years, while prosecutions for illegal possession are down 14%. Penalties for these crimes are also relatively light, with a third of those charged serving no jail time, and those who do typically serving one to four years of a possible 10-year sentence.\n\nRepublican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia has proposed a bill to make straw purchases a federal crime and to increase the penalty from 10 to 20 years. Rigell argues, \"When four out of 10 straw buyers suffer no meaningful consequences for what they did, we have a problem.\"\n\nThis article aims to provide a neutral and factual account of the current state of gun crime prosecutions and the ongoing debate surrounding the enforcement of existing gun laws.",
    " Title: Upcoming Gitmo Detainee Transfers to Africa: A Dozen Detainees to Leave Guantanamo Bay This Month\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is set to transfer two detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to an undisclosed African country this weekend, according to a U.S. official speaking to Fox News. This transfer is part of a planned series of transfers, with approximately a dozen detainees expected to leave the facility in two rounds over the coming weeks.\n\nIn January, the Pentagon conducted a bulk transfer of 10 detainees, marking the largest transfer from the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to date. However, due to legal requirements, these transfers cannot happen all at once, as the Pentagon is obligated to notify Congress 30 days before any transfers. The first notification was sent to Congress in early March, with a second notification issued in mid-April.\n\nCurrently, there are 91 detainees remaining at Guantanamo Bay. Thirty-five of these detainees have been cleared for transfer to other countries. The first transfer of two detainees is scheduled for this weekend, with the remainder expected in the middle of next month.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman declined to confirm the transfer of any Gitmo detainees beginning this weekend, stating, \"I do not have a timeline on when particular detainees will be transferred from Guantanamo. However, the Administration is committed to reducing the detainee population and to closing the detention facility responsibly.\"\n\nIn the past, the Pentagon has only confirmed detainee transfers once they are completed. The detainees are flown on U.S. military aircraft to their third-party nation.\n\nThere has been controversy surrounding the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay in the past. In a recent revelation, the Pentagon's point man for Gitmo stated that some of the detainees transferred from the prison have, in fact, re-joined the fight and in some cases, have been involved in actions that have resulted in American casualties.\n\nCongressman Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., has questioned the administration's statistics, stating, \"Unfortunately, there have been Americans that have died because of GITMO detainees.\" The Pentagon later issued a statement claiming that only 5% of detainees who have been released have returned to the battlefield during the Obama administration.\n\nSenator McCain has refuted the administration's statistics, stating that he believes more released Gitmo detainees return to the battlefield, posing a threat to American lives. \"We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight,\" McCain said.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon submitted a plan to transfer those detainees not eligible for transfer overseas to American prisons in Colorado, Kansas, or South Carolina. However, this plan was immediately rejected by Congress, who passed a law forbidding the transfer of any Gitmo detainees to the United States.\n\nIn response to the ongoing controversy, President Obama reiterated his commitment to closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, stating, \"This is about closing a chapter in our history.\" However, critics in Congress have called for a comprehensive plan for handling ISIS detainees, as the U.S. military has no plans to hold captured Islamic State operatives for more than a month before turning them over to the Iraqi government.",
    " Title: FBI Director Robert Mueller Grilled on IRS Probe, NSA Surveillance, and Benghazi Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated hearing on Thursday, FBI Director Robert Mueller faced a barrage of questions from lawmakers regarding various ongoing investigations, including the IRS's targeting of Tea Party and conservative groups, the federal government's surveillance programs, and the Benghazi scandal.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) seemed particularly frustrated with Mueller's lack of specific details about the IRS probe. \"You've had a month now to investigate,\" Jordan said. \"This has been the biggest story in the country and you can't even tell me who the lead investigator is.\"\n\nMueller repeatedly declined to answer Jordan's questions, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation or promising to get back to the lawmakers with answers. When Jordan asked, \"Can you tell me who the lead investigator is?\", Mueller responded, \"Off the top of my head, no.\"\n\nThe day didn't go much better for Mueller, who was also grilled on a number of other topics, including the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs, the Benghazi scandal, and the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\nMueller defended the government's collection of millions of U.S. phone records, emails, and other information as vital to the nation's national security. He argued that the metadata collection program, had it been in place before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, would have identified one of the 9/11 hijackers in San Diego and most likely derailed the plot.\n\nHowever, Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. expressed skepticism, stating, \"I'm not persuaded that the argument makes it OK to collect information on every call.\" Conyers added that by Mueller's interpretation, it would be \"anything and everything goes\" situation.\n\nMueller also testified that the government's controversial surveillance programs complied \"in full with U.S. law and with basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution.\"\n\nThe Justice Department revealed last month that it had secretly gathered emails of Fox News correspondent James Rosen and phone records of The Associated Press in an effort to crack down on leakers of classified information. The department later acknowledged that Attorney General Eric Holder was on board with a search warrant for Rosen's personal emails, obtained after federal officials accused him in an affidavit of being a likely criminal \"co-conspirator\" under a wartime law known as the Espionage Act.\n\nIn the past week, a 29-year-old contractor leaked NSA documents on the agency's collection of millions of U.S. phone records and the NSA's collection of emails and other information that people transmit online to and from foreign citizens. This has sparked a national debate over whether the Obama administration, in its efforts to thwart terrorism, has overstepped by using intrusive surveillance methods.\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the committee's chairman, said when it comes to national security leaks, it's important to balance the need to protect secrecy with the need to let the news media do its job. Goodlatte also said the committee planned to find out more about the status of what the congressman called the FBI's \"stalled investigation\" into the attack in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.\n\nAs for the Boston Marathon bombings, committee members want to know whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing between federal agencies, preventing the FBI from thwarting the explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Decisions and Voting Laws: A Comprehensive Overview of Recent Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day approaches, the flurry of last-minute legal activity surrounding state voting laws continues. Here's a recap of the significant decisions and ongoing cases that may impact the voting process in several states:\n\n1. Arkansas: The Arkansas Supreme Court has struck down the state's voter ID law, finding that requiring voters to present a photo ID imposes a new qualification for voting, violating the state's constitution. The ID law will not be in effect for the November elections.\n\n2. Ohio: The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed Ohio to cut back its early-voting period, overturning a lower court ruling. Early voting will now start on Oct. 6 instead of Sept. 30, and will be limited during evening hours and on Oct. 26. Opponents argue that these changes will disproportionately affect minority voters.\n\n3. North Carolina: The U.S. Supreme Court has stayed a federal appeals court decision to block part of the state's new voting law. The appeals court had ruled that two provisions\u2014eliminating same-day voter registration and prohibiting the counting of ballots cast in the wrong precinct\u2014should not go into effect this year.\n\n4. Wisconsin: The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked a federal appeals court ruling that would have allowed the state's voter ID law to go into effect this year. For now, Wisconsin voters do not have to show a photo ID at the polls.\n\n5. Texas: Civil rights groups have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the state's new voter ID law, one of the strictest in the nation, from remaining in effect this year. A decision is expected soon.\n\n6. Arizona and Kansas: A case involving a requirement for voters to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote is pending. The states are suing to get the federal government to change its registration form to reflect this requirement. A decision could come before Election Day.\n\nThe Supreme Court has shown a reluctance to allow major voting changes to be put in place right before an election. However, it has not ruled on whether these laws are constitutional. That's expected to happen after the election, and more likely next year.",
    " Title: Car Manufacturers Pivot Production Lines to Aid in Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a global effort to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, major car manufacturers are repurposing their production lines to produce much-needed medical equipment such as ventilators and face masks.\n\nOn Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced plans to convert one of its plants in China to produce about one million masks per month. The company aims to start production in the coming weeks, as stated in an email by FCA's CEO, Mike Manley.\n\nSimilarly, General Motors, Ford, Tesla, and other carmakers in the US, Japan, and Europe have pledged their support to offer resources for the production of ventilators. Ford, in collaboration with GE Healthcare and 3M, is working on designing modified respirators and ventilators, which could be produced using fans, batteries, and other car parts.\n\nWhile the firms have not set a timeline for the delivery of the products, Ford has already started manufacturing transparent face shields to complement existing protective gear for hospital staff. The company expects to produce about 75,000 of such shields this week.\n\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday, urging car and auto execs to speed up the production of ventilators and other medical equipment. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reduced barriers in the medical device approval process to expedite the production of ventilators.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that carmakers may face challenges in switching production due to the highly specific materials and components required for ventilators. Jens Hallek, head of ventilator manufacturer Hamilton Medical, told Wired that the materials and components needed to build a ventilator are \"highly specific\" and require \"specialized know-how.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he had purchased 1,255 FDA-approved ventilators from China and had them shipped to Los Angeles. Formula 1 teams in the UK are also working with the government and health authorities to increase the supply of medical equipment, with a hope for a tangible outcome in the next few days.\n\nOther car manufacturers, such as Nissan, are part of consortiums looking to develop new medical ventilators. Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra's company, The Mahindra Group, has also announced plans to explore how its factories can produce ventilators. The conglomerate is the world's largest tractor maker and India's biggest electric vehicle manufacturer.",
    " Title: Congressional Impasse Leads to Doubling of Interest Rates on Federally Subsidized Stafford Student Loans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford student loans have doubled overnight, rising from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent following Congress's failure to reach a consensus on the matter. This increase, if not reversed, is estimated by the Congress's Joint Economic Committee to cost the average college student an additional $2,600.\n\nThe increase in interest rates has been a contentious issue between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats advocating for maintaining low interest rates to support poor and middle-class students in their pursuit of higher education. On the other hand, Republicans have proposed linking student loans to the financial markets, a proposal that President Obama has also considered in his budget sent to Congress earlier this year. This market-based approach has been met with resistance from fellow Democrats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, expressed hope that President Obama would be able to persuade Democrats to join a bipartisan effort to assist students. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has expressed skepticism about tying loan rates to the 10-year treasury note yield, stating that such a proposal would not pass the Senate without stronger protections for students and parents.\n\nAdam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, stated last week that a deal on student loans could not pass the Senate due to the Republican insistence on shouldering the burden of student loans on students and middle-class families, rather than closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. Senate Democrats, according to Jentleson, are working towards a compromise, but the Republicans are unwilling to relent on this critical point.\n\nSenate Democrats have indicated that they may consider voting on a one-year extension of the current interest rates on July 10, following a recess for the 4th of July holiday. However, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed a preference for including a comprehensive student loan measure in a long-range law governing colleges and universities. Warren stated that a one-year patch would provide the necessary time to address the issue comprehensively.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Expresses Uncertainty Over Sequester's Economic Impact, Questions White House's Communication Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, House Speaker John Boehner expressed uncertainty over the potential impact of the forced spending cuts, known as the sequester, that began taking effect on Friday. Boehner, in a recent op-ed, argued that the sequester could threaten \"U.S. national security, thousands of jobs, and more.\"\n\nDuring an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Boehner stated, \"I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not.\" He further added, \"I don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work.\"\n\nBoehner and President Barack Obama were among those who issued dire warnings about the $85 billion in cuts that are now supposed to take place over the next seven months, the remainder of the fiscal year. Both sides escalated their rhetoric in the weeks leading up to the sequester deadline, March 1, in an attempt to build pressure on the other side to compromise and reach a deal to avoid the cuts.\n\nWhen asked if he had been exaggerating the consequences of the spending cuts before the deadline, Boehner responded, \"I am concerned about its impact on our economy and its impact on our military. Listen, we've known about this problem for 16 months.\" He went on to blame Democrats and President Obama for not acting to address the issue.\n\nPresident Obama, in a press conference on Friday at the White House, did not sound as pessimistic about the impact of the cuts as he and his administration had before the deadline. He stated, \"What's important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away. The pain, though, will be real. Beginning this week, many middle-class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways.\"\n\nWhen asked if the president had been exaggerating his claims about the sequester, Boehner pointed to the example of Education Secretary Arne Duncan stating that teachers in West Virginia were already being laid off because of the spending cuts. Duncan's claim has since been debunked.\n\n\"There's a lot of questions about how the White House is handling the communications on this,\" Boehner said. The House Speaker's comments come as both parties continue to grapple with the implications of the sequester and seek a solution to mitigate its effects.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Importance of Blood Sugar Control in COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes\n\nA new study published in the journal Cell Metabolism has provided evidence that people with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) who maintain control over their blood sugar levels will fare better if they contract the novel coronavirus. The study, which examined a cohort of 7,336 COVID-19 patients with or without T2D from 19 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, found that those with well-controlled blood sugar who had COVID-19 were less likely to die than those whose blood glucose was poorly controlled.\n\nThe data showed that people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and T2D required more medical interventions, despite these interventions, they also had significantly higher mortality - 7.8 percent versus 2.7 percent - as well as a greater incidence of multiple organ injury. However, those with well-managed blood sugar who had COVID-19 were less likely to die than those whose blood glucose was poorly controlled. They also received fewer medical interventions including supplemental oxygen and/or ventilation and had fewer health complications.\n\n\"We were surprised to see such favorable outcomes in the well-controlled blood glucose group among patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing Type 2 diabetes,\" said senior study author Hongliang Li, at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. \"Considering that people with diabetes had much higher risk for death and various complications, and there are no specific drugs for COVID-19, our findings indicate that controlling blood glucose well may act as an effective auxiliary approach to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and preexisting diabetes,\" the study found.\n\nExperts have also highlighted that risk factors for dying from COVID-19 include the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The virus has devastated African-American and Hispanic communities in several states. \"The alarming COVID-19 mortality rate in America's communities of color can be directly attributed to problems with health access and resources - the same issues which link these communities to disproportionately high rates of diabetes and related chronic diseases,\" said Tracey Brown, president and CEO of the American Diabetes Association. \"In order to tackle America's systemic health inequity problem, we must meet those who are most at risk in their community. Greater accessibility and availability to COVID testing is critical in order to slow the rampant spread of COVID-19 in minority communities.\"\n\nOverall, researchers said their work offers a few core messages for those with diabetes: They should take extra precautions to avoid becoming infected with COVID-19 due to the higher risk of severe complications or dying after being infected, and those with diabetes should take extra care to keep their blood sugar under good control during the pandemic.",
    " Title: Florida's COVID-19 Surge and Controversial Legislative Actions: A Critical Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Florida, once again, finds itself in the national spotlight, this time as the new epicenter of COVID-19 infections. As of July 6, the state has surpassed 200,000 cases and over 3,731 deaths. In South Florida, where cases are most concentrated, hospitals are reducing elective surgeries as three of Southwest Florida's nine acute-care hospitals have no available intensive-care unit beds for adults.\n\nAmidst this dire situation, Governor Ron DeSantis signed SB 664: Verification of Employment Eligibility, also known as E-Verify, into law on June 30. This bill requires businesses in Florida to use the program to verify the employment eligibility of their workers, potentially leading to discrimination against immigrants.\n\nThe timing of this bill's passage has raised concerns, as it was prioritized during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, when Florida was experiencing its first two deaths and anxieties about a spreading pandemic were rising. Immigrant rights organizations warned that this would intimidate undocumented immigrants in the state and cause them to avoid contact with any government institution due to fear of being detained and deported.\n\nSince assuming office, Governor DeSantis has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, with many accusing him of improvising, falsifying data, and blaming others for his failures. DeSantis has refused to take steps to mitigate the spread by closing down non-essential businesses, a tactic that has helped bring the virus under control in other states.\n\n\"We're not going back, closing things,\" DeSantis said. \"I don't think that's really what's driving it. People going to a business is not what's driving it. I think when you see the younger folks\u2014I think a lot of it is more just social interactions, so that's natural.\"\n\nDeSantis has also been criticized for his lack of commitment to encouraging people to stay home or wear masks. Instead, Florida Republicans have chosen to push for an economic restart in the middle of a pandemic that is overwhelming the healthcare system in South Florida.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, DeSantis and his supporters still find the time to push policies like E-Verify that harm vulnerable populations. Critics argue that this is cruel and unnecessary, especially during a pandemic.\n\nThomas Kennedy, a communications fellow for Community Change Action, has been vocal about his concerns. \"November, and our chance to repudiate these hateful Republican politicians at the ballot box, can not come fast enough,\" Kennedy tweeted."
