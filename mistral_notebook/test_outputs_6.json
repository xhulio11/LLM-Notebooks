    " Title: Senate Postpones Vote on Unemployment Insurance Extension Due to Weather-Related Absences; Rescheduled for Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the U.S. Senate has postponed a key procedural vote on a contentious proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting approximately 1.3 million Americans due to the absence of more than a dozen lawmakers caused by travel disruptions resulting from inclement weather. The vote, initially scheduled for Monday evening, has been rescheduled for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe postponement follows unanimous approval from both parties for a delay, granted by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid just before the chamber was due to hold the test vote. Backers of the bill to extend long-term unemployment benefits were reportedly nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote.\n\nFour Republicans, including Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have stated they will vote to begin debate on the bill. However, this is still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster.\n\nThe political landscape on Capitol Hill is expected to be influenced significantly by the upcoming midterm elections, particularly in the Senate, where Republicans are aiming to regain control. Extending benefits is a priority for congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama, who is emphasizing income equality as a key aspect of his second term.\n\nThe $6.4 billion extension is a point of contention for many Republicans, who argue that it could harm the economy and discourage job creation. Some GOP members have signaled they might support an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk, a Republican known for working across the aisle, received a call from Obama but missed it due to being out of the office. Kirk expressed a desire to help those in need but emphasized the importance of finding a way to pay for the measure without adding to the deficit irresponsibly.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, one of the four Republicans who has stated she will vote to begin debate on the bill, has not ruled out blocking it later if cost offsets are not added. \"I want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it. Ultimately, I think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it's more closely linked to job training for the long-term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back,\" she said.\n\nThe other three Republicans who have expressed support for the bill are Dean Heller of Nevada, a co-sponsor of the bill, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.\n\nDemocrats view the test vote as a potential win-win situation. If Republicans back the bill, they can build momentum for the measure. If Republicans do not, they gain a political advantage. In remarks before the vote, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged a delay \"so we can have a real debate\" and decide how to pay for the extension.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7% in November, according to the most recent Labor Department statistics. This means more than 10 million people were out of work, with a third of them unemployed for at least 27 weeks. The benefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after Congress opted not to continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out.\n\nDemocrats argue that the program is crucial to help Americans who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery. Republicans counter that the program, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost $26 billion to continue for another year, is costly and acts as a disincentive to looking for work. The Senate will reconvene on Tuesday to hold the rescheduled vote on the unemployment insurance extension.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Administration's Response to Coronavirus Outbreak, Highlights Economic Growth and Judicial Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a town hall event on Thursday, President Donald Trump defended his administration's response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, emphasizing the initial closure of the U.S.-China border and the relative low number of infections in the country.\n\nWhen asked about a long-term plan to tackle the outbreak, Trump said, \"We have plans for every single possibility.\" He also contrasted his response to the coronavirus with the Obama administration's public health policies, invoking a comparison he made on Wednesday between the coronavirus crisis and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 during the early days of the Obama presidency.\n\nTrump also used the town hall to tout his appointment of about 200 federal judges, asserting that his predecessor left him a slew of vacancies to fill. In reality, Republicans in the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, filibustered dozens of Obama-appointed judges, stalling them in the Senate.\n\nThe president also addressed the rapidly dwindling Democratic field, with Trump saying Bernie Sanders would be a formidable challenger because of his loyal base. He needled Elizabeth Warren for dropping out after Super Tuesday, saying she split the progressive vote to the detriment of Sanders.\n\nTrump closed the town hall with an unusual message of respect for his fellow Washington insiders, diverging from his \"drain the swamp\" message and saying, \"I have a lot of close friends. I really do.\" He added that he speaks to all senators and congressmen frequently and praised the \"great people\" in Washington.\n\nWhen asked how he could bring a fractured America together again, Trump said, \"I really believe we are going to win back the next election and when we do, the other side is going to say OK, that is it, let's get along.\" He added that many Democrats were on board to collaborate with him in the coming years, despite a faction he called the \"radical left Democrats.\"",
    " Title: The Republican Senate: A Continuation of Government by Crisis as Ted Cruz's Influence Grows\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the midterm elections, the Republican Party's takeover of the Senate has led to a shift in power, and the question of whether the Tea Party would finally break free from its House quarantine has been a topic of debate. However, it appears that the era of government by crisis, characterized by debt ceiling standoffs, government shutdowns, and other contentious issues, is not coming to an end. Instead, the new Senate is shaping up to be a reflection of Ted Cruz's ideological and procedural radicalism.\n\nThe recent news of President Obama's planned executive orders on immigration reform has sparked a response from a bloc of at least 50 Republican lawmakers, who are reportedly planning to thwart these orders by attaching language to \"must-pass\" legislation, such as funding for the government. This move highlights the continued willingness of the Republican Party to use government shutdowns as a tool for political leverage, despite promises to end gridlock and partisan warfare following the midterms.\n\nRepublican Representative Matt Salmon, the chief organizer of the push, stated, \"If we have an opportunity to actually do something rather than complain... why shouldn't we?\" This approach, while logical from the perspective of those who view the president's actions as lawless, has been met with criticism from some within the party.\n\nConservative commentator Erick Erickson, known for his outspoken views, has called for the Republican Party to take more drastic measures, such as turning Camp David into a refugee holding facility and closing down all golf courses controlled by public funds. Erickson's comments, while humorous in nature, are a clear indication of the frustration felt by some on the right wing over the perceived lack of action from the Republican Party.\n\nInterestingly, the voice of Ted Cruz, the likely future presidential candidate and Tea Party favorite, has been notably absent from the conversation. While Cruz has spoken about avoiding the \"mushy middle\" and aggressively repealing Obamacare, he has been relatively quiet on the specifics of his vision for the new Senate. This could suggest that Cruz is assessing the level of influence he can wield in a Republican Senate, and the early signs indicate a GOP still divided and prone to government shutdowns.\n\nAs the new Congress prepares to be sworn in, it remains to be seen how the Tea Party's influence will shape the Senate and the government as a whole. However, the early indications are that the era of government by crisis is not over, and Ted Cruz is poised to play a significant role in this ongoing dynamic.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Foreign Tour Kicks Off on a Rocky Note in Britain\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's foreign tour, which began in Britain, has started off on a less-than-smooth note, with a series of missteps and diplomatic faux pas.\n\nThe tour, intended to showcase Romney's foreign policy acumen, has been marred by a series of incidents that have raised eyebrows and caused controversy.\n\nThe first incident involved comments attributed to an anonymous campaign adviser in a British newspaper, suggesting that Romney understood the shared \"Anglo-Saxon heritage\" between the U.S. and Britain in a way that President Obama did not. The comments were viewed as racist by some and were swiftly disowned by the Romney campaign.\n\nRomney himself then caused a stir by expressing doubts about the security and other logistical issues surrounding the London Olympics, stating that it was \"hard to know just how well it will turn out.\" This was met with a sharp rebuke from British Prime Minister David Cameron, who quipped, \"We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nAfter a meeting with Romney at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, Romney walked back his earlier remarks, expressing confidence in the games. However, this appeared to be too little, too late, as London's mayor, Boris Johnson, used Romney's earlier comment to rally tens of thousands of Londoners at a pre-opening ceremonies rally.\n\nJohnson, in a rousing speech, declared, \"Are we ready? Yes we are. Our venues are ready. The stadium is ready. The aquatic center is ready... the security is ready... the police are ready... and our athletes are ready. Aren't they? Team GB [Great Britain] is ready. They're going to win more gold, silver, bronze medals than you'd need to bail out Greece and Spain together.\"\n\nIn addition to the verbal gaffes, Romney also breached British protocol by publicly disclosing a meeting with Sir John Sawers, the head of the British intelligence agency known as MI6. Such meetings are typically not acknowledged, according to British news outlets.\n\nThe tour, which includes stops in Poland and Israel, was intended to demonstrate Romney's foreign policy credentials. However, the early stages of the trip have not gone as planned.\n\nThe liberal-leaning British newspaper The Guardian and the conservative-leaning Daily Telegraph both kept tabs on the British reaction to Romney on their respective Election 2012 blogs.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Romney can recover from these early missteps and successfully navigate the remainder of his foreign tour.",
    " Title: President Obama Unveils Executive Order to Increase Minimum Wage for Federal Contract Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at building momentum for a nationwide minimum wage hike, President Barack Obama has announced an executive order to increase the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour, up from the current rate of $7.25. The order, which has been advocated by progressive Democratic lawmakers, will affect more than 2 million employees, according to an administration official.\n\nDuring Tuesday night's State of the Union address, the president will call on Congress to pass a Democratic plan to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 over three years, and to adjust it for inflation. The proposal also includes a rise in the minimum wage for tipped workers.\n\nCritics argue that raising the minimum wage could potentially discourage businesses from hiring more workers during a time when job growth is a priority. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell stated on \"Fox News Sunday\" that \"We have a crisis in employment among young people right now, and generation 18 to 30, people that got out of college, are finding there are no jobs for them. The last thing we want to do is have even fewer jobs for younger people.\"\n\nHowever, the president is focusing on the economy once more, as he seeks to revive the issue. Last year, Obama called for a federal minimum wage hike during his State of the Union speech, stating, \"Let\u2019s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour.\"\n\nThe new executive order only applies to future contracts, not existing ones, and will only affect contract renewals if other terms of the agreement change. As a result, the order will benefit fewer workers than initially estimated by advocates of federal contract employees.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner downplayed the impact of the latest executive order, stating, \"Let's understand something: this affects not one current contract, it only affects future contracts with the federal government. And so I think the question is, how many people, Mr. President will this executive action actually help? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero.\"\n\nIn December, Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote to the president urging him to take the \"bold step\" of signing an executive order to increase wages for federal contractors. At the time, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a lukewarm response to the lawmakers' request.\n\nObama is expected to use Tuesday's State of the Union address to outline his intentions to use executive powers to achieve his goals when Congress fails to pass legislation. The minimum wage issue has gained prominence in the slowly recovering economy and the growing public debate about income inequality. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage, including more than half of Republicans polled.\n\nFive states passed minimum wage measures last year, and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals. Many of these proposals would lift families above the federal poverty line, which is $15,730 for a family of two. In Iowa, a bill would raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10.\n\nDemocrats across the political spectrum have advocated for a higher minimum wage this year, following Obama's call for an increase in his February budget speech. Since then, union-organized demonstrations in front of profitable mega-chains such as Wal-Mart and McDonald's have kept the issue in the public eye.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses James Comey of Leaking Classified Information, Amidst Ongoing Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified information, following a report that more than half of the memos Comey wrote detailing Russia-related conversations with the president contained classified material.\n\nAccording to a report by The Hill, citing \"officials familiar with the documents,\" Comey authored a total of seven memos describing his talks with Trump on the Russia case earlier this year, and four of them had markings indicating they contained classified material at the \"secret\" or \"confidential\" level.\n\nThe memos, which were recently shown to Congress, were described by Comey's team as personal, despite the FBI's claim that they were all government documents.\n\n\"James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!\" the president tweeted.\n\nThe claims in The Hill regarding Comey's memos are reminiscent of the same kind of allegations against former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom Comey's team investigated for mishandling classified material on her private server and email.\n\nThe report comes as Trump and his family are grappling with a New York Times report that Donald Trump Jr. and other members of the president's inner circle met last summer with a Russian lawyer with the expectation of getting \"damaging information\" on Clinton \u2013 information that, according to Trump's son, did not materialize.\n\nA special counsel has been tasked with investigating Russian meddling in the campaign and possible collusion with Trump associates, ever since Trump fired Comey earlier this year.\n\nOn the heels of that firing, Comey first admitted in congressional testimony that he had used an old friend at Columbia University to get his notes leaked to The New York Times about his discussions with Trump.\n\nHowever, when asked about the latest claims, Columbia University professor Daniel Richman \u2013 the Comey friend who leaked part of one memo to The New York Times \u2013 told Fox News on Monday that \"this is a non-story.\"\n\n\"No memos were given to the press, and no memos were classified at the time I received them,\" Richman told Fox News, explaining that the \"substance\" of one memo was given to the press but not the physical document.\n\n\"That was not classified at the time, and remains unclassified,\" he said.\n\nRichman told Fox News he received four memos from Comey, all of which were not marked. Richman questioned the White House claims.\n\n\"It's kind of interesting that the White House is now suggesting they're true,\" Richman said.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller's office declined to comment on the ongoing investigation when asked about the report in The Hill.\n\nHowever, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway called the latest report an \"incredible bombshell\" and said Monday that Comey was at least violating FBI rules if the account is true.\n\n\"The boy scout, choir boy defense does not hold up here because if it contains classified information, he is apparently violating, at the very least, what all FBI members sign \u2013 they sign a document saying you will not do something like this,\" Conway told \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\n\"The irony to me, anyway... is that this is exactly the problem that Hillary Clinton had with her illegal server \u2013 the handling of classified and confidential information that Jim Comey was meant to investigate, if not prosecute,\" Conway added.\n\nConway recalled Comey's testimony, when the fired FBI director admitted leaking his notes to a close friend with the intent to trigger an appointment of a special counsel.\n\n\"If people go back and listen to him under oath, he is admitting what his intent was,\" Conway said. \"You couple that with the fact that this was classified information, I think this is what the story should be \u2013 not all this nonsense about Russian collusion and what not.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Healthcare Bill Faces Setback as Senate Republicans Struggle to Gain Support\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate healthcare bill, a key legislative priority for the Republican party, has once again stalled after two conservative senators announced they would not support the legislation due to its failure to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The bill, spearheaded by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would result in 22 million more Americans being uninsured by the end of the decade, primarily due to Medicaid cuts, and many of those who retain insurance under the bill would pay more for fewer benefits.\n\nThe bill was amended following a report from the Congressional Budget Office, but the GOP decided not to wait for a new score before moving forward. Democratic senators are universally opposed to the legislation, while the most moderate and conservative Republicans have also refused to sign on, either because it does too much or too little to move away from Obamacare's improvements to the healthcare system.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's media supporters are grappling for a response to the bill's setback. The message from the White House has been inconsistent on healthcare, largely due to the president's lack of interest in the policy debates surrounding the future of health insurance for American citizens. In May, the president held a Rose Garden event to celebrate the passage of the House bill, which he described as a \"great plan.\" Weeks later, he turned around and privately called that legislation \"mean.\"\n\nIn the absence of clear messaging from the top, Trump's media allies have turned their criticism towards McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI). Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle stated last night, \"I think this is a failure on the part of the leadership, to be quite honest. Because they needed to get this to stick and to coalesce and get it done.\" Steve Doocy added on Fox & Friends this morning, \"Second failure for Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nIf the Senate bill continues to struggle, and Trump does not publicly support McConnell, we could see calls for his replacement in the near future. Trump's lack of interest in policy leaves his supporters plenty of room to say that they didn't like the bill, without creating any dissonance about the fact that the president supported the legislation. Doocy went after the bill from the start this morning, saying, \"Ultimately, what undid this bill is -- the one they are not going to vote on now -- is it was a lousy bill. I mean, it still had big taxes. It still had a lot of regulations. It had that insurance company subsidy slush fund that Rand Paul was talking about. It was not what the American people wanted.\"\n\nOne of the challenges Senate Republicans faced in pushing through healthcare legislation is that, due to the need for 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, they were trying to pass the bill with a 50-vote threshold through the budget reconciliation process. This process limits what can actually go into the bill, making full repeal of Obamacare extremely difficult.\n\nIn order to sidestep that process, the hosts of Fox & Friends are calling for Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster altogether, making all votes subject only to a majority vote. It's unclear how this would help pass a healthcare bill since Republicans just demonstrated they don't have 50 votes in the Senate. Trump, who regularly watches Fox & Friends, tweeted, \"The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!\"",
    " Title: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders Speech at NetRoots Nation Draws Thousands, Highlights Tensions Within Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political move, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders addressed an audience of over 11,000 activists at the Phoenix Convention Center, marking his largest speaking engagement to date. The event coincided with the annual gathering of NetRoots Nation, a national meeting of thousands of leftist activists, bloggers, and special interests.\n\nThe presence of these activists in town for the conference undeniably boosted attendance for Sanders' speech. While it may seem unusual for an aging political figure to captivate an audience with a list of left-wing policy issues, Sanders' appeal and the combative tone of the NetRoots conference present a growing challenge for traditional Democrat party members.\n\nEarlier in the day, both Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley faced protests during a town-hall style panel at the conference. O'Malley, who spoke first on the panel, was interrupted by approximately 40 \"Black Lives Matter\" protesters, who stormed the room while an activist seized the microphone.\n\n\"We are going to hold this space and acknowledge the names of black women who have died in police custody, and then Governor O'Malley, we do have questions for you!\" protester Tia Oso declared. \"As leader of this country, will you advance an agenda that will dismantle structural racism in this country?\"\n\nBoth O'Malley and Sanders, who wear their leftist politics openly, seemed taken aback by the exchange. In part of his response, O'Malley said that \"all lives matter,\" a statement that he later apologized for, acknowledging that it may have offended some. He expressed regret if the phrase caused any offense.\n\nSanders, amidst a torrent of jeers, turned to the moderator and asked, \"What are you doing here?\" and \"Are you in charge here?\"\n\nThe twin events on Saturday highlight the promise and challenges of the growing activism among hard-core leftists. On one hand, their attendance contributed to Sanders' largest campaign event to date, providing a crucial backdrop for media coverage that has fueled his rise in the polls.\n\nOn the other hand, the palpable anger among these committed activists, fueled over the years by the explicit design of President Obama and national Democrats, is taking over the party. It is driving the national party not only into the far reaches of leftist philosophy but also a deep embrace of identity politics that is likely to alienate most voters.\n\nAs one Black Lives Matter protester later explained, \"It's not like we like shutting things down, but we have to. We are tired of being interrupted.\"",
    " Title: American Special Forces Successfully Rescue Journalist Luke Somers, but Civilian Casualties Occur in Yemen Raid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a daring operation, American Special Forces successfully rescued journalist Luke Somers, who had been held captive in Yemen since his kidnapping in 2013. However, the rescue mission resulted in civilian casualties, with at least eight non-combatants, including a 70-year-old man, being killed during the raid.\n\nThe operation took place on Saturday in the village of Shabwah, in the southern province of Yemen. According to a tribal leader, Tarek al-Daghari al-Awlaki, the American commandos raided four houses, killing at least two militants. The family of Luke Somers, who had been pleading for his release in a video released shortly before the death, was notified of his death by the FBI.\n\nThe American commandos, aided by a small number of Yemeni counterterrorism troops, used V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft to approach the village under cover of darkness. The operation faced steep odds, with the compound being guarded by about half a dozen gunmen and the approach being difficult, virtually eliminating the element of surprise. The commandos were detected when they were less than 100 yards from the compound.\n\nThe intelligence on Luke Somers' location was accurate, and it seems likely that the deadline set by the militant captors to kill him on Saturday set the clock on carrying out the mission. The operation on Saturday began at about 1 a.m. This marks the second time in recent years that American Special Operations forces have failed to free hostages in a raid, with a similar incident occurring in Syria in July.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the killings represent a larger shift in the tactics of Al Qaeda, which has largely turned away from executing hostages in recent years in favor of negotiating ransoms. When they have faced military raids, Al Qaeda militants have executed hostages. The operation on Saturday was the latest in a series of global combat missions undertaken by America's Special Operations forces since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the most notable being the raid into Pakistan in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden.",
    " Title: Cleveland Police Rescue Three Women Held Captive for Decades\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, three women who had been missing for over a decade were found alive in a house near downtown Cleveland on Monday. The women, identified as Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight, were kidnapped in their teens or early 20s and were held captive in the house since then.\n\nThe rescue began with a frantic 911 call from Amanda Berry, who pleaded for help to escape from the house on Cleveland's west side before the captor returned. Berry, now 27, had disappeared in 2003, and DeJesus, 23, and Knight, 32, had vanished in 2002 and 2004, respectively.\n\nNeighbors Charles Ramsey and Anna Tejeda played crucial roles in the women's rescue. Ramsey heard screaming and saw Berry at a door that could only be opened enough to fit a hand through. He helped her escape by calling the police, who arrived within minutes and took the other women from the house. Tejeda, who was sitting on her porch with friends, heard someone across the street kicking a door and yelling. One of her friends went over and helped Berry kick the screen out of the bottom of the door, allowing her to get out.\n\nAuthorities arrested three brothers, but they have not released their names or any information about them or the charges they might face. The women appeared to be in good health and were taken to a hospital for evaluation and to be reunited with their families. A 6-year-old child was also found in the house, but police did not disclose the child's identity or relationship to anyone in the house.\n\nThe women's loved ones expressed their joy and relief at their rescue. Kayla Rogers, a childhood friend of DeJesus, said she could not wait to hug her, while Tasheena Mitchell, Berry's cousin, said she could not wait to hold Berry and squeeze her.\n\nThe women's disappearance took a toll on their families, particularly Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, who died in 2006 after spending three years looking for her daughter. Councilwoman Dona Brady spent many hours with Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive.\n\nMayor Frank Jackson expressed gratitude that the women were found alive and said there are many unanswered questions in the ongoing investigation. At Metro Health Medical Center, the women are being evaluated by appropriate specialists, and their conditions are not being discussed in detail.\n\nIn January, a prison inmate was sentenced to 4 1/2 years after admitting he provided a false burial tip in the disappearance of Berry. Last summer, two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of DeJesus in 2004 were released from the city jail after officers did not find her body during a search of the men's house. In September 2006, police acting on a tip tore up the concrete floor of the garage and used a cadaver dog to search unsuccessfully for DeJesus' body.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and authorities have not released any information about the charges the three brothers might face or their names. The women's rescue has brought relief and joy to their families and friends, and they are now looking forward to reuniting with their loved ones.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Condemns Bill Clinton's 'Super Predator' Remark, Criticizes Welfare Reform at Apollo Theater Forum\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed the controversial \"super predator\" remark made by former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and criticized Clinton's handling of crime and poverty during his two-term presidency at a race-centered forum held at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York on Saturday.\n\nDuring the event, Sanders made it clear that he has significant differences with Clinton's approach to crime and poverty during his time in office. He also rebuked Clinton for defending his wife's use of the phrase \"super predator\" to describe perpetrators of violent crime.\n\n\"The president owes the American people an apology for trying to defend what is indefensible,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhen someone in the audience at the Apollo Theater shouted that the \"super predator\" reference was code for \"black people,\" Sanders responded, \"That's exactly right.\"\n\nSanders and Hillary Clinton are currently competing to win the New York primary on April 19. With Sanders having performed poorly with minority voters in earlier contests, he has been making efforts to forge stronger ties to the African-American community as the campaign moves to diverse states like New York. The event at the Apollo Theater was one such effort, with Sanders sharing the stage with African-American supporters including entertainer Harry Belafonte and Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner, who died two years ago in a struggle with police who put him in a chokehold.\n\nWhen asked about Hillary Clinton, Belafonte, who is also a civil-rights activist, said, \"Hillary who? We've been there and done that.\"\n\nThe first question Sanders received from the moderator involved Clinton's extended back-and-forth with a pair of protesters in Philadelphia on Thursday. In that exchange, Clinton sought to explain his wife's use of the term \"super predator.\" He talked about gang leaders who were getting teenagers \"hopped up on crack\" and sending them out to kill other African-Americans.\n\nClinton also defended a bill he signed as president in 1996 overhauling the welfare system by imposing limitations on federal assistance and enacting new work requirements. When protesters said the welfare law increased poverty, Clinton said, \"Then why did we have the largest drop in African-American poverty in history when I was president?\" He blamed Republicans for subsequently undercutting the program by yanking money intended to cushion the law's impact.\n\nSanders was unsparing in his criticism of the welfare legislation, casting it as a cynical ploy to win votes.\n\n\"Do you all remember that?\" he asked the audience. \"The premise, which was a right-wing Republican premise, was that the problem was all these people were really living high off the hog.\"\n\nA consequence of the new law was that \"extreme poverty \u2026 went up,\" Sanders said.\n\nClinton signed the law as he was campaigning for re-election in 1996.\n\n\"Here are people who are helpless, who are barely making it economically,\" Sanders said. \"To go after them to win votes and cut the benefits of children and moms is unacceptable.\"\n\nClinton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A day after his clash with the protesters, Clinton voiced regrets over the episode. He said he was not especially \"effective\" in dealing with the criticism.",
    " Title: The Complexities of US-Iran Relations: A Look at Iran's Foreign Policy and the Potential for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing US-led nuclear deal negotiations with Iran are primarily focused on Iran's nuclear program, yet they also spark debates about Iran's role in the Middle East. As Iran continues to assert its influence and maintain a foreign policy that is largely hostile towards the US and its allies, questions arise about the potential for change in Iran's foreign policy.\n\nSteve Coll, a renowned journalist, recently discussed this issue on a podcast, comparing Iran to the Sunni Arab countries in the Middle East. He noted that while the US faces Sunni Arab countries with pro-American elites and deeply hostile populations, in Iran, the situation is reversed. The elites are mostly hostile, or require hostility to maintain their power, while the population is ready for change.\n\nColl's observations were made in the context of Iran's annual Quds Day celebration, where hard-liners chant against Israel and America. During his visit, Coll found that many attendees were not genuine supporters but were bused in for the event. He also noted that, despite the anti-Western deeds and rhetoric of the regime, the population is largely over the idea of a never-ending revolutionary struggle against the foreign devils.\n\nHowever, the Iranian government has important constituencies that earnestly believe in anti-Western policies. These include security agencies, the clerical establishment, and hard-liners who believe their legitimacy rests on maintaining hostility with the West. The tension between Iran's anti-American elite and its more pro-normalization population is a real problem for the country's leadership and its stability.\n\nThe comparison to Sunni Arab dictatorships is particularly apt, as these countries also have governing elites and security-military establishments that like the West and see Western support as crucial, but rule over populations that are more anti-American. This creates political problems in those countries, and while it has managed to hold for decades, it could hold in Iran as well.\n\nThe contradiction between desiring authoritarian elites to overrule their populations in Sunni Arab societies, while wanting popular opinion to reign in Iran, is a reflection of the larger instability in American foreign policy in the Middle East and the status quo in the region.

United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe nine justices on the Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday in a potentially significant case, Elonis v. United States, regarding free speech on the Internet. The case revolves around Anthony Elonis, who was convicted of making threats of violence and sentenced to nearly four years in prison after posting hostile messages on Facebook about his community and his then-estranged wife, following a protective order against him. Elonis claims his threats were not serious and were merely original rap lyrics.\n\nThe case is the first major test of free speech rights on the Internet, and the court's eventual ruling could apply to more traditional forms of communication. According to CNN's Jan Crawford, after hearing complicated and convoluted arguments from both Elonis' lawyers and government lawyers, the justices seemed skeptical of both sides.\n\nJohn Elwood, an attorney for Elonis, said after the arguments that he thought they went \"reasonably well\" but agreed the outcome would be \"very hard to tell.\" He stated that a victory for the government in this case could have far-reaching consequences for communications online, where the intent of one's message is not always clear.\n\n\"Increasingly, people who speak on the Internet, which is where much speech happens today, could be held subject to felony liability not because they intended to threaten anybody but because somebody misinterpreted their comments as a threat,\" Elwood said. \"That is a risk on the Internet, where you're frequently speaking to people without the context of tone of voice, body gestures, and frequently talking to people who you do not even know in the physical world.\"\n\nJeff Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said after Monday's arguments that the government made a strong case. Dion argued that throwing out Elonis' conviction would effectively \"make a rulebook on how to legally threaten your spouse.\"\n\nShould Elonis win, it would invalidate a majority of stalking statutes in the U.S., Dion said. He added that \"a threat is a threat,\" whether it comes via social media or otherwise. Paulette Sullivan Moore of the National Network to End Domestic Violence echoed this sentiment, stating, \"If I leave the message on your windshield, or post it on your door, or post it on the Internet -- however I communicate, whatever medium I use to communicate the threat -- doesn't make it any less a threat.\"\n\nAccording to Scotusblog, \"The Justices did not spend a lot of time analyzing whether the Internet was different from other forums of communications, [although] now and then a Justice would throw in a presumably knowing reference to Eminem or to rappers more generally.\" The outcome of the case remains uncertain, as the justices seemed divided during the arguments.",
    " Title: Trump Narrows Down Supreme Court Nominee List, Plans Interviews Over Weekend\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, US President Donald Trump has announced that he plans to announce his nominee for a new Supreme Court justice on July 9. The decision comes after the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy earlier this week, which has created a vacancy on the nine-member US Supreme Court.\n\nDuring a flight from Washington to New Jersey on Friday, President Trump stated that he has narrowed his choice down to \"about five\" candidates, including two women. He also mentioned that he would be interviewing one or two of these candidates over the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster.\n\nThe US Supreme Court plays a crucial role in US society, often serving as the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, stopped President Barack Obama's immigration orders, and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward.\n\nJustice Kennedy, who is 81, has been a key figure on the court, despite being a conservative. He has sided with liberals on previous decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights.\n\nSeveral front-runners for the vacancy have been reported by US media. Brett Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge in Washington DC and a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is at the top of most lists. Other potential nominees include Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame. Raymond Kethledge, a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals and also a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is another possible contender.\n\nIn other news, President Trump also discussed his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next month. He stated that they would be discussing allegations of Russian election meddling, as well as the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the war in Syria. When asked about the possibility of lifting US sanctions on Russia, President Trump responded, \"We'll see what Russia does.\"\n\nThe President also addressed the World Trade Organization (WTO), stating that it had treated the US \"very badly,\" but he was not considering pulling out. He emphasized that the US is the country's largest contributor.\n\nPresident Trump also clarified that he would not ask Supreme Court candidates about their position on the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision, which legalized abortion across the US. During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to deliver \"pro-life\" judges to the Supreme Court, a prospect that has alarmed women's rights groups.",
    " Title: Trump Visits U.S.-Mexico Border, Threatens Tariffs on Mexican Imports Amidst Immigration Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday, President Donald Trump reiterated his call for increased border security and threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles entering the U.S. if the situation does not improve. The visit comes as the U.S. immigration system grapples with a surge in Central American migrants seeking asylum.\n\nDuring a discussion with border officials, Mr. Trump expressed concern over the number of migrants crossing the border illegally or requesting asylum at legal border crossings. He stated, \"We can't take you anymore. I'm sorry. Can't happen. So turn around.\"\n\nThe President's comments were made at one of two international ports of entry in California's Imperial Valley, where he also visited a proposed border wall. Mr. Trump recently declared a border emergency to redirect funding for a border wall.\n\nThe President criticized the asylum system, claiming that people are fabricating stories of violence at home to stay in the U.S. \"It's a scam. It's a hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I know about hoaxes, I just went through a hoax.\"\n\nGang violence remains a significant issue in Central America, and Mr. Trump's recent call to cut off financial aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador has been met with criticism from members of both parties as counterproductive.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently estimated that about 100,000 migrants crossed the border illegally or asked for refuge at legal border crossings in March, a level not seen in more than a decade.\n\nDespite the tough rhetoric, Mr. Trump has backed off a threat to close the border entirely, stating that Mexico had made progress in apprehending migrants and stopping their journey to the U.S. border. However, before leaving Washington, he reiterated a new threat: if the situation doesn't improve, he will impose tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles entering the U.S.\n\n\"If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"This will supersede USMCA,\" he added, referring to the revised North American trade pact.\n\nThe President also said Ron Vitiello, a veteran border official, is no longer being considered to lead the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The nomination was withdrawn unexpectedly on Thursday. \"Ron's a good man,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But we're going in a tougher direction.\"\n\nThe move leaves the agency without a leader at a crucial time, and Mr. Trump didn't mention any potential replacements.\n\nThe President has sent mixed signals regarding the timeline for imposing tariffs, stating Thursday he would give Mexico a year to show action before leveling tariffs, but later saying he could still close the border. On Friday, he said, \"I never changed my mind at all. I may shut it down at some point, but I'd rather do tariffs.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the tariffs would work \"100%.\" He also mentioned exploring an economic policy for drugs coming over the border.\n\nTensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have risen due to Mexico's recent shift in migration policies. The administration of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has begun offering humanitarian visas to Central American asylum seekers making the trek across Mexico and has also cut back on deportations.\n\nMexico hasn't commented on whether it has stepped up migrant apprehensions in recent days as Mr. Trump has asserted, but government officials have said they believed trade and migration issues should be kept separate.\n\nMr. Trump didn't immediately clarify how he would carry out potential levies against Mexico. The Commerce Department has studied applying global tariffs on automobiles and auto parts on the grounds that such imports constitute a threat to national security.\n\nThe U.S., Mexico, and Canada in November signed a new pact overhauling their 25-year-old trade zone, concluding a year and a half of diplomacy after Mr. Trump was on the verge of pulling the U.S. out of the bloc.\n\nThe pact needs congressional approval and has encountered some opposition. Mr. Trump scoffed at that as \"purely political\" in remarks to reporters Thursday. \"The USMCA, everybody wants to see it passed,\" he said. \"But we'll see. Whatever they want to do is OK with me.\"\n\nAfter the border tour, Mr. Trump was scheduled to hold a series of fundraisers in California and Nevada on Friday and Saturday. He is also to deliver a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Las Vegas.",
    " Title: Obama and Xi: A New Era of U.S.-China Relations: Dreaming of a Shared Future\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy's dream of a prosperous and peaceful America, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet in California this weekend, marking a significant opportunity for both leaders to define a new era in U.S.-China relations.\n\nForty-five years ago, as a high school senior, the author stood on street corners handing out literature for Senator Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign. The quote that resonated was, \"Some see things as they are and say why, I dream things that never were and say why not.\" Last February, the author stood with President Xi Jinping, then vice president, at a luncheon, experiencing a new kind of Chinese leader. The discussion extended far beyond the allocated time, showing a Chinese leader willing to expose his human side.\n\nToday, when President Xi speaks of his \"Chinese dream,\" the author is reminded of that time when RFK talked about that dream. Like RFK, President Xi dreams of poverty alleviation, national rejuvenation, and freedom from corruption. His message is to not repeat the mistakes of history, to not allow historic great power rivalries to dictate our future.\n\nOn the domestic front, Premier Li Keqiang, in a speech delivered to senior party leaders, has committed to an aggressive agenda for economic reform, pledging to reduce government involvement in the economy and allowing market forces to play a greater role in guiding economic growth and increasing investment and innovation.\n\nInternationally, China is becoming the responsible stakeholder that Robert Zoellick called for in his speech before the National Committee in 2005. Improved military-to-military relations, commitments to establish standards for cyber hacking, and progress on long-stalled discussions regarding diligence by auditors on Chinese listed companies show progress on issues long stalled.\n\nPresident Xi's dream is about reform, and President Obama should do all that he can do to help him achieve the reform he seeks. As a first step, Obama and Xi should announce the commencement of negotiations for a free trade agreement with a three-year deadline for conclusion. A free trade pact would not only add jobs in America but also help China in its economic reforms.\n\nThey should also enliven the negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty and set a one-year deadline for completion. Bilateral investment will play an increasingly important role in this new great power relationship. To jump-start a major Chinese investment in the U.S., Obama should also pledge to authorize exports of shale gas to China.\n\nThe protection of intellectual property must be a top priority in a new great power relationship because both sides require it. In order to achieve an innovation society, China knows it must protect intellectual property. For the U.S., theft of its citizens' intellectual property makes it difficult to believe that China is committed to a truly new relationship. The presidents should establish a bilateral task force to agree on specific policies that will ensure greater protection for intellectual property.\n\nFinally, the presidents should announce that Obama will visit China within the next twelve months and during that visit, he will directly address the Chinese people about his vision of the future for America and U.S.-China relations. Let the two presidents lay the foundation for this new great power relationship and dream things that never were and ask why not.\n\nStephen A. Orlins, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, emphasizes the importance of this new era in U.S.-China relations. The future of both nations lies in their ability to work together and dream of a shared future.",
    " Title: US Senate Calls for Second Investigation into Khashoggi's Murder, as Trump Defends Saudi Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could escalate tensions between the US and Saudi Arabia, Republican and Democratic leaders of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee have called for a second investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The request, issued under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, demands a response within 120 days and specifically targets Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe call for a second investigation comes after US President Donald Trump acknowledged that the crown prince \"could very well\" have known about Khashoggi's brutal murder, adding, \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" The president later stated that the CIA had not made a \"100%\" determination on the killing.\n\nThe Saudi government has blamed Khashoggi's death on rogue agents but denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. However, US media have reported that the CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Trump told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it \"a suffering tape.\"\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement issued by Republican Senator Bob Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez, called on Trump to focus a second investigation specifically on the crown prince to \"determine whether a foreign person is responsible for an extrajudicial killing, torture or other gross violation\" of human rights.\n\nSaudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, has been a key ally of the US, particularly in the fight against Iran. The kingdom has spent billions of dollars on leading the fight against \"Radical Islamic Terrorism,\" while Iran has \"killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe statement also highlights Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases, stating that if these contracts are cancelled, Russia and China would be the \"enormous beneficiaries.\"\n\nWhile admitting the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was \"terrible,\" Trump wrote that \"we may never know all of the facts\" about his death. He also stated that the US intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of the US, Israel, and other partners in the region.\n\nTrump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended.\n\nThe release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. Trump's approach to foreign policy, with its blunt language and narrow, interests-based approach, has been a subject of debate and criticism.\n\nThe president's stance on the Khashoggi case has further dismayed Washington's allies in the West, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a \"Russia First\" and a \"China First\" approach in international affairs.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful. The take-away from this situation in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. US policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter.",
    " Title: Stranded Americans in Yemen Await Evacuation as U.S. Weighs Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the cargo hold of a wooden vessel, Muna Mansour and her family of nine, along with two other families, are making the best of their cramped and uncomfortable conditions. The Mansour family, originally from Buffalo, New York, is among the dozens of American citizens caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflict in Yemen.\n\nFor over three weeks, Saudi Arabia has been conducting airstrikes in an attempt to drive out the Shiite Houthi rebels, who have taken control of government buildings and some territory. The bombings have decimated some cities, including Aden, and foreigners find themselves trapped.\n\nMuna was visiting her sick father in Aden when the fighting broke out. With the Houthi forces to the north and the waters of the Gulf of Aden to the south, the city is essentially besieged. It took over 30 hours of travel, and a lull in the fighting, for the vessel to dock at one of Aden's smaller ports.\n\nThe State Department has stated that it is too risky to conduct an evacuation of citizens from the area. \"We have to make a decision based on the security situation and what is feasible to do,\" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said earlier this month. \"And given the situation in Yemen is quite dangerous and unpredictable, doing something like sending in military assets even for an evacuation could put U.S. citizen lives at greater risk.\"\n\nA group of U.S. organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League, have filed a lawsuit against the State Department and Defense Department over the government's stance on evacuations.\n\nFor Muna, her ordeal ended at Djibouti Port where Christina Higgins, the U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission, was among the embassy staff waiting to meet them. Higgins spoke about the challenges of evacuating U.S. citizens from Yemen, stating, \"We have one of the branches of al Qaeda that's especially active. There's the Houthis -- neither of these two groups friendly to U.S. citizens. We've had to weigh very, very carefully what is the safest way, the best way for us to help them.\"\n\nHiggins emphasized that each U.S. citizen is going to have to judge what is best for themselves and their families. \"For many U.S. citizens, that's going to mean sheltering in place. For other U.S. citizens, we're actively working at getting information to them on different avenues for travel out of Yemen,\" she said.\n\nWatching the U.S. embassy staff hand out cookies, water, and phones to reassure those waiting at home, it's clear the staff are overjoyed to have some of their citizens safe and sound. However, there are many more who are still in danger. The 15 Americans on board the vessel said they had counted 75 more families waiting in Aden port who could not afford the \"exit/transport\" fee being charged to depart Aden. This fee, not an official tax, was being charged by local fishermen to ferry passengers to the boat to board.\n\nAs the conflict in Yemen continues, the U.S. government is faced with the difficult decision of balancing the safety of its citizens with the complexities of the ongoing conflict. The situation remains fluid, and the fate of many American families remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Admits to Manipulating Online Polls at Trump's Direction\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer of U.S. President Donald Trump, admitted on Thursday that he paid a data firm to manipulate online polling data \"at the direction of and for the sole benefit of\" Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen had paid the data firm RedFinch Solutions to manipulate two public opinion polls in favor of Trump before the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nCohen, in a tweet on Thursday, stated, \"As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it.\"\n\nThe attempts to influence the polls ultimately proved largely unsuccessful but shed light on the tactics of the Trump campaign and Cohen's role within it. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently referred to his polling numbers to help fuel his candidacy.\n\nCohen was sentenced last month to three years in prison for his role in making illegal hush-money payments to women to help Trump's campaign and for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Russia.\n\nCohen has said Trump had directed him to commit the campaign-finance violations, which Trump has denied.\n\nThe Journal said Cohen commissioned John Gauger, who runs RedFinch Solutions, to write a computer script to repeatedly vote for Trump in a February 2015 Drudge Report poll on potential Republican candidates. Trump ranked fifth in the Drudge Report poll, with about 24,000 votes, or 5 percent of the total, according to the Journal.\n\nCohen also commissioned Gauger to do the same for a 2014 CNBC online poll identifying the country's top business leaders, although Trump was unable to break into the top 100 candidates, the Journal reported.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in an interview that the president had no knowledge of the polls being rigged. Trump tweeted about a CNBC poll on business leaders in 2014, calling it \"a joke\" and suggesting he was removed from the list because of \"politics.\"\n\nThe details of the newspaper report could not be immediately confirmed by \u2588\u2588\u2588. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did representatives for RedFinch Solutions and the Trump Organization. Charles James, a lawyer for Gauger, declined to comment.\n\nGauger said Cohen paid him in cash out of a blue Walmart bag, although not for the total amount he was owed. Cohen also promised Gauger work on the Trump campaign that never materialized, according to the Journal.\n\nCohen worked for Trump for many years as his self-proclaimed fixer, and once said he would take a bullet for Trump. However, the relationship has since publicly soured. Trump has called Cohen a \"rat,\" while Cohen has cooperated with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia during the campaign. Both Trump and Moscow have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCohen has also agreed to testify publicly in front of the House of Representatives' Oversight Committee in a hearing scheduled to take place next month.",
    " Title: FBI Documents Reveal Extent of Michael Cohen Investigation, Detailing Business Dealings and Trump Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the FBI's investigation into President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, was underway for nearly a year before the agency raided his home and office, recently disclosed documents show. The search warrant, albeit heavily redacted, offers new insights into the federal inquiry of Cohen's business dealings and the subsequent FBI raids on his Manhattan residence and office.\n\nThe documents, released Tuesday, indicate that the federal investigation into Cohen had been ongoing since July 2017, a period significantly longer than previously known. Lanny Davis, an attorney for Cohen, stated that the release of the search warrant \"furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.\"\n\nThe FBI raids, which took place in April last year, marked the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has posed a threat to Trump's presidency and resulted in Cohen's three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations. The federal agents, who also searched Cohen's hotel room and safe deposit box, seized over 4 million electronic and paper files, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.\n\nBoth Cohen and Trump expressed dissent over the raids, with Cohen's attorney at the time describing them as \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary,\" and the president taking to Twitter to declare that \"Attorney-client privilege is dead!\" A court-ordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged.\n\nThe raids on Cohen were partly initiated following a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is separately investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Tuesday's release of the search warrant came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Associated Press, that the search warrant be made public due to the high public interest in the case.\n\nThe judge acknowledged prosecutors' concerns that a wholesale release of the document \"would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties.\" This revelation suggests that prosecutors are still investigating Cohen's illegal payments to two women to keep silent about alleged affairs with Trump.\n\nThe judge ordered prosecutors to redact Cohen's personal information and details in the warrant that refer to ongoing investigations and several third-parties who have cooperated with the inquiry. However, he authorized the release of details in the warrant that relate to Cohen's tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen's conduct that did not result in criminal charges.\n\n\"At this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government's ongoing investigation,\" Pauley wrote in a ruling last month. Cohen pleaded guilty over the summer to failing to report more than $4 million in income to the IRS, making false statements to financial institutions, and campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments he arranged for porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen implicated Trump in his guilty plea, stating that the president directed him to make the payments during his 2016 campaign.",
    " Title: College Students' Perception of Free Speech: A Contradictory Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report on student views of free speech, published on May 5 by the Knight Foundation in partnership with Gallup, has raised concerns about the future of free speech in the United States. The report reveals a paradoxical series of findings, with college students supporting restrictions on \"offensive\" speech while also expressing concerns about the erosion of free speech.\n\nThe report shows a significant increase in the proportion of students who believe colleges should be able to restrict language containing slurs, rising from 69 percent in 2016 to 78 percent in 2019. Moreover, an overwhelming 71 percent of students (up from 63 percent) think colleges should be able to restrict the use of \"stereotypical costumes,\" a matter that might typically be considered beyond the jurisdiction of college administrators.\n\nIn contrast, the number of students who believe the First Amendment is secure has decreased, with 59 percent of respondents holding this view, compared to 73 percent in 2016. A majority of students also believe that the climate of their campus stifles free expression, and many acknowledge that liberals are freer to speak their mind than conservatives.\n\nThe findings seem contradictory at times, with large numbers of campus liberals aware of the receding free speech in colleges and elsewhere, yet championing further speech restrictions. A more likely interpretation is that these students increasingly perceive \"hate speech\" and other insensitive forms of expression as beyond the bounds of protected free speech.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that staggering numbers of students continue to believe that \"hate speech\" is legally restricted. Only 30 percent of respondents answered in the affirmative when asked if hate speech is protected by the First Amendment, with nearly half claiming that it is not. The result is even more dismal when looking exclusively at Democrats, with only 23 percent knowing that hate speech is protected.\n\nThe kindest interpretation is that this reflects a mere misunderstanding of the First Amendment and not a statement of preference. However, in tandem with the large majorities that are in favor of college restrictions of insensitive forms of expression, the report implies that many college liberals believe their censorship preferences are also enshrined in law.\n\nAmerica's college students are its future politicians, media figures, teachers, and bureaucrats. Unfortunately, the report suggests that their tilt toward an authoritarian view of speech has only grown.",
    " Title: SNL Tackles Performative Activism: A Critique of Corporate and Individual Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent episode of Saturday Night Live, the popular comedy sketch show took on the topic of performative activism, critiquing both corporate and individual actions that may appear altruistic but lack genuine commitment. The show's centerpiece was a satirical take on the infamous Pepsi ad that featured Kendall Jenner joining a protest movement, using a can of Pepsi to bridge the gap between protesters and police.\n\nThe original ad, which was met with widespread criticism and eventually removed from the internet, was a source of controversy due to its trivialization of the Black Lives Matter movement, the use of diverse individuals as props, and the portrayal of police responses that ignored historical double standards. In the SNL sketch, a fictional representative of the ad's creators, played by Beck Bennett, slowly realizes the wild miscalculations that led to the ad's creation, expressing a sense of shame and embarrassment that serves as a slight balm to those who have been shaking their heads at the ad all week.\n\nAnother sketch from this week's SNL, titled \"Thank You, Scott,\" satirized the rise of armchair activism, a phenomenon that, while better-intentioned than the Pepsi ad, is equally inefficient. In the sketch, Louis CK's hapless character, Scott, is moved by the injustices he sees in the world but lacks the motivation to take productive action. Instead, he shares an article on Facebook and adds \"Black Lives Matter\" to his Twitter bio, prompting a chorus of multicultural voices to sing a song (mockingly) praising all the \"Scotts\" for doing the least they can do.\n\nThe sketches serve as a reminder that while each of us may be fallible in matters of cultural sensitivity, it is essential to critically evaluate our actions and ensure they are genuinely supportive and not merely performative.",
    " Title: President-elect Trump Nominates Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President-elect Donald Trump announced on Monday the nomination of former rival Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Trump expressed his excitement over the nomination, praising Carson's intellect and passion for strengthening communities.\n\nCarson, who had previously downplayed any role in the Trump administration, recently stated he didn't know where he would fit. However, in a statement on Monday, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon expressed his desire to \"make a significant contribution, particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need.\"\n\nCarson's nomination for HUD might seem unusual at first glance, given his previous rumored contention for roles such as Veteran's Affairs, Education, or Health and Human Services. However, Carson has spoken and written about HUD and the issues it addresses extensively during his time as a primary candidate. In a Facebook post last month, Carson hinted at a potential HUD job offer from Trump.\n\n\"After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\" Carson wrote. \"We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation\u2019s housing needs are met.\"\n\nCarson also mentioned the HUD position as one of the offers from Trump during a Fox News Channel interview last month. \"Our inner cities are in terrible shape,\" Carson said. \"And they definitely need some real attention. There have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done, so it certainly is something that has been a long-term interest of mine.\"\n\nTrump has also announced his intention to nominate retired Marine General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense. Carson ran against Trump during the Republican primary battle but endorsed the businessman after dropping out of the White House race in March. Carson's position in the cabinet requires Senate confirmation before it becomes official.\n\nCarson, who grew up in inner-city Detroit, has often shared stories of his childhood struggles in his books and motivational speeches. In his 1996 autobiography \"Gifted Hands,\" Carson wrote about the humiliation he felt using food stamps to pay for bread and milk, and how he began to excel at school only after receiving a free pair of glasses that allowed him to see the lessons written on chalkboards.\n\nCarson has not confirmed whether his family ever lived in federally-funded housing or received Section 8 subsidies to help pay rent. As a political figure, he has criticized such public assistance programs for creating \"dependency\" on the government among low-income minorities.\n\n\"I'm interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society,\" Carson said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015. \"And as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"",
    " Title: Obamacare Employer Mandate Delay: Six Key Questions and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent announcement by the Treasury Department has delayed the implementation of a key part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, for one year. The employer mandate, or the shared responsibility rules, will not require businesses to offer health coverage to their employees or face penalties until 2015.\n\nThis unexpected move comes as the White House was gearing up for its public education campaign and enrollment to begin in October. The delay could potentially affect the number of people who will be covered under the new health insurance exchanges or marketplaces, as the employer mandate was not as central to the coverage push as the individual mandate.\n\nThe delay has raised several questions and implications:\n\n1. Is this the only delay the Obama administration will announce, or could it be the first in a series of delays?\n2. Will the individual mandate, a central component of the law, be affected?\n3. How will this delay impact the public's perception of Obamacare, and will it fuel the critics' arguments about the law's chaotic implementation?\n4. How will the delay affect the 2014 House and Senate campaigns, and will it embolden critics who call for the law's repeal or defunding?\n5. How will insurance companies respond to potential changes in the individual mandate, and what impact will it have on the cost and availability of health insurance?\n6. How will businesses respond to the delay, and will it alleviate concerns about the law's impact on the fragile economic recovery?\n\nThe White House maintains that the main elements of the law will be ready to go in October, and allies argue that the employer mandate delay only affects a segment of the law, not its core. However, the delay could have significant political and practical implications for the implementation of Obamacare.",
    " Title: Senate Impeachment Trial: A Political Chess Match Amidst Uncertain Witnesses and Documents\n\nArticle:\n\nThe delivery of the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate on January 15, 2020, marked the beginning of a new phase in the impeachment process. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, along with other impeachment managers, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, Rep. Val Demings, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, and Rep. Jason Crow, were present for the historic event.\n\nHowever, the Senate Republicans' approach to witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial has been met with criticism from the House Democrats. The fate of the impeachment trial, according to some, hinges on the presence of witnesses. If the Senate does not comply with the House's desired witnesses and documents, it is being accused of an \"unconstitutional and disgusting cover-up.\"\n\nThe House's insistence on Senate witnesses and documents is a contentious demand that mirrors the House's attitude towards the Senate's proceedings. The House, which rushed the impeachment process, is now urging the Senate to take up its investigative mantle. The House impeached Trump without key witnesses and documents, but the Senate is being pressured to hold a trial without them.\n\nThe House's impeachment process has been marred by a lack of time, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi prioritizing impeachment over a thorough investigation into Ukraine. Key witnesses, such as John Bolton, were not subpoenaed, and the release of new, disturbing Lev Parnas documents came after the House had already impeached Trump.\n\nThe Senate Republicans' argument for not calling witnesses is that the broad outlines of Trump's actions are already known, and the Senate only needs to decide whether his conduct rises to the level of removal. However, if Republicans maintain Trump did not engage in any misconduct, the natural question arises as to why key witnesses like Bolton should not testify to put the allegations against Trump to rest.\n\nThe impeachment process has been politically charged, with Speaker Pelosi rushing impeachment in part to get it over with as soon as possible for her vulnerable members. The Senate trial will likely be a political chess match between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, with the outcome of the witness issue depending on the contours of this contest.",
    " Title: Daughter of Ronald Reagan Condemns Father's Racist Remarks in Op-Ed\n\nArticle:\n\nPatti Davis, the daughter of former President Ronald Reagan, has denounced her father's recently uncovered racist remarks in an op-ed published in the Washington Post. In the article, Davis condemns her father's use of the term \"monkeys\" to describe African United Nations delegates in a 1971 phone call with then-President Richard Nixon.\n\nThe recording, released by the National Archives and published by The Atlantic on Tuesday, reveals Reagan venting about delegates who voted against the U.S. to have the United Nations recognize the People's Republic of China. In the call, Reagan can be heard calling the delegates \"monkeys,\" stating, \"To see those, those monkeys from those African countries\u2014damn them, they\u2019re still uncomfortable wearing shoes!\"\n\nIn her op-ed, Davis wrote, \"There is no defense, no rationalization, no suitable explanation for what my father said on that taped phone conversation.\" She asked for forgiveness for her father's words, but stated that these remarks were an \"aberration.\"\n\nDavis wrote, \"The words he used in his conversation with Nixon can not be interpreted as anything but ugliness.\" She added, \"That's what makes this so painful.\"\n\nDavis also noted that this is not the first time Reagan has been criticized for racist remarks. During his 1966 campaign for governor in California, Reagan stated that it was an individual's right to discriminate against African Americans in selling or renting their homes, according to Politico. Reagan also helped create the \"welfare queen\" stereotype, which portrayed black women as abusing taxpayer dollars to support lavish lifestyles.\n\nHistorians have also cited \"racist policies\" implemented during Reagan's presidency that disproportionately harmed people of color, laying the groundwork for his \"War on Drugs.\"\n\nThe previously unheard audio recording has surfaced during President Donald Trump's relentless Twitter attacks on four minority progressive congresswomen and Baltimore Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings. Trump has often referenced Reagan during his presidency and shares a slogan Reagan used during his 1980 campaign, 'Make America Great Again.' Trump has repeatedly defended his own statements, including tweeting that he doesn't have \"a racist bone in his body.\"\n\nA July Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of Americans view Trump as a racist.",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Speech: A Shift in Tone and Focus, but Questions Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from his usual free-flowing, off-the-cuff speeches, Donald Trump delivered a carefully crafted foreign policy address on Wednesday, marking a significant shift in tone and focus. The speech, however, left many questions unanswered, and it remains to be seen whether it will alter the perception of Trump as a foreign policy novice.\n\nThe speech, Trump's first serious attempt to address foreign and American concerns about his knowledge of foreign affairs, contained almost none of his earlier prescriptions for restoring America's economic and military greatness. Instead, it focused on his populist themes and his determination to pivot from what he called the \"Obama-Clinton\" foreign policy, which he criticized as having alienated traditional allies and friends and led the nation's foes to lose respect for the U.S.\n\nWhile many Republicans and even some Democrats would agree with his stark critique of some of the administration's contradictory, sometimes too-little, too-late initiatives, he offered few concrete remedies for restoring the economic strength that Trump believes underpins America's ability to project power abroad.\n\nOne of the toughest sections of the speech was Trump's withering critique of Hillary Clinton's expertise and performance as Secretary of State. He criticized her record of supporting the war in Iraq and other military interventions abroad, an implicit criticism of President George W. Bush as well. He also accused her of having \"misled\" the nation about the attack on America's consulate in Benghazi, where the U.S. ambassador and \"three brave Americans\" were killed. Instead of \"taking charge\" that night, he said, \"Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep.\"\n\nTrump's speech was notable for what he did not say. There was no mention of his determination to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and get the Mexican government to pay for it. There was no mention of letting South Korea and Japan acquire nuclear weapons or of walking away from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He did not say that he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal on day one or insist that it be renegotiated. He simply declared that Iran would not be permitted to get a nuclear weapon, which is precisely what President Obama said prior to signing his controversial agreement with Teheran.\n\nTrump's pledge to prevent American companies from moving abroad and force America's allies to pay more for their own defense by tougher negotiations with them suggested there remain similar gaps in his knowledge of American law and foreign affairs. Studies have shown that it is cheaper to base the 28,000 American troops in South Korea there than it would be to keep them at home; and South Korea already pays half of those costs.\n\nCritics of President Obama's foreign policy are likely to dismiss Trump's gaffes and contextual omissions as quibbles, and welcome his call for a more robust military, a tougher stance against Islamic radicalism at home and abroad, and an America-centric foreign policy. Republican \"realists\" will also welcome his call to deploy force \"when there is no alternative,\" a pledge which mirrors the isolationist mood of part of his party and the country.\n\nHowever, Trump's speech did not provide a clear roadmap for how he would achieve these goals, and it remains to be seen whether he can translate his populist rhetoric into concrete policies that can win over both Republicans and Democrats.",
    " Title: Sequester Debate Unchanged as Economy Shrinks Amidst Failed Agreement on Automatic Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent news of the economy shrinking towards the end of the year has been met with a sense of resignation among many members of Congress, as the looming threat of the sequester remains unchanged. If Congress fails to reach an agreement to stop the sequester, the Defense Department would face a $500 billion cut, while $700 billion would be taken from other domestic discretionary programs.\n\nSteve Bell, a former top aide on the Senate Budget Committee and current fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., expressed his Hill contacts' reactions to the news that a 22.2 percent drop in defense spending led to the U.S.'s fourth-quarter GDP shrinking by 0.1 percent. Bell stated, \"Not much. There is a sense of resignation among many members on the Hill. The pro-defense people have kind of lost momentum. The big deficit hawks have gained momentum. And the general, not a majority yet, but certainly a strong minority consensus is: 'Let the sequester occur. It's the only spending cuts we're ever going to get out of this entire mess from the last four years.'\"\n\nBell warned that the sequester, and its impact on defense, would lead to furloughs of civilian defense workers, the sale or bankruptcy of small subcontractors, and potentially a million lost jobs just from the defense sequester alone. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Wednesday's news a \"clamorous klaxon horn sounding danger.\"\n\nDefense contractors, who have much at stake, also saw danger signals. Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, warned that the cuts to defense spending are causing companies to pull back, lay off workers, and have real economic impacts. A study by George Mason University economists forecasts 2 million lost jobs in the first year of a sequester.\n\nHowever, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former Congressional Budget Office director, does not agree that the fourth-quarter GDP data is a cause for alarm. He expects the Commerce Department number-crunchers to eventually revise upward the fourth-quarter data, citing the U.S. military withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the Pentagon following orders to downsize over 10 years, as part of the reason for the decrease in defense spending.\n\nDespite the differing views, the sequester debate remains unchanged, with both sides continuing to hold firm to their positions. The White House blames Republicans for letting matters get to the present stage, while House Republicans attempt to hold up a mirror to President Obama. The focus, according to many economists, should be on entitlement cuts rather than the sequester.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes One-Year Extension for Cancelled Health Insurance Policies, Sparking Industry and Policy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has proposed a one-year extension for health insurance policies that would otherwise be cancelled due to the Affordable Care Act. This move is aimed at addressing the ongoing controversy surrounding the cancellation of individual insurance policies and the subsequent backlash from affected consumers.\n\nDuring his Thursday press conference, Obama stated, \"The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be cancelled into 2014.\" The announcement follows a series of public criticisms and political pressure, particularly from Democrats, for the administration's handling of the health care law's implementation.\n\nIndustry CEOs have been summoned to a White House meeting on Friday, an event expected to be filled with discussions about the ongoing relationship between the administration and the health insurance industry. The meeting is likely to be marked by conversations about accountability and the future of the health care market.\n\nHowever, the proposed one-year extension has raised concerns within the industry and among actuaries. Health insurance plans have already set their prices for the Obamacare plans based on a specific number of customers and a balanced mix of healthy and sick individuals. If they do not attract the anticipated number of customers, the mix will be disrupted, potentially leading to increased premiums and market instability.\n\nKaren Ignagni, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group, stated, \"Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers.\"\n\nCori Uccello, the senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, echoed these concerns, stating, \"Changing the [Affordable Care Act] provisions could alter the dynamics of the insurance market, creating two parallel markets operating under different rules, thereby threatening the viability of insurance markets operating under the new rules.\"\n\nThe proposed extension is seen by some as a political solution to a policy problem, potentially creating unintended consequences. Bill Pierce, a former Department of Health and Human Services official who has also worked in the health insurance industry, commented, \"It is a political solution to a policy problem... You can not solve a policy problem with a political solution.\"\n\nThe administration's proposal comes as Democrats face increased pressure to address the cancellation issue, with a Republican bill currently in the works that would allow all Americans to keep their health plans. The need for a political solution, however, may not justify changes that could have unforeseen consequences, according to Pierce.\n\nIn his press conference, Obama acknowledged the administration's role in the rollout issues, stating, \"What we want to do is to be able to say to these folks, you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan.\" The president's comments suggest a recognition of the need to address the public's concerns and to distance the law from the cancellations.\n\nAs the health care debate continues, the proposed one-year extension is likely to be a central point of discussion, with implications for both the health insurance industry and the millions of Americans affected by the cancellations.",
    " Title: Witnesses Recount Final Moments of Alton Sterling's Fatal Encounter with Police in Baton Rouge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the parking lot of a Baton Rouge convenience store where 37-year-old Alton Sterling was fatally shot by police, concentric rings of protesters gathered on Wednesday, a day after the incident. The outermost ring was filled with young men driving cars around the block with speakers blaring \"Fuck the police.\"\n\nAs one moved inward, the mood became more somber, with neighbors sharing stories about Sterling and handing out snacks and drinks. Local community leaders pleaded with the crowds to remain peaceful, while at the center, a trio of devastated people stood and stared.\n\nTawandra Carr, who lived near the store and had a playful relationship with Sterling, was the last person to speak to him before the shooting. At around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Carr approached Sterling in the parking lot, and the two pretended to argue before breaking into laughter. Sterling seemed in a good mood, neither knowing that an anonymous caller had just told police Sterling had threatened him with a pistol, and officers were on their way.\n\nSterling had packed up his wares for the night, but Carr persuaded him to sell her a bootleg copy of the new film Central Intelligence. He charged her two dollars.\n\nSuddenly, two police cars arrived from opposite directions and pulled into the parking lot. Carr said two officers, 28-year-old Blane Salamoni and 29-year-old Howie Lake, pushed past her and made straight for Sterling, who seemed baffled. \"He just kept saying: 'What did I do? What did I do?'\" she said.\n\nWithout answering, she said, the officers went for their Tasers and shocked Sterling. \"He didn't go down,\" Carr said. \"He was still saying: 'What did I do?'\"\n\nCarr's account, at that point, starts to coincide with a video made by a bystander. It shows the officers tackling Sterling onto the hood of a car, then to the ground where they pin him. In the midst of overlapping yelling and cursing, one of the officers cried out: \"He's got a gun!\" and both officers drew weapons.\n\nAbdullah Muflahi, who has owned the Triple S since 2010 and had always allowed Sterling to hawk his music and movies in the parking lot, arrived just as police did. He pulled his phone from his pocket and started recording. The officers kneeled on top of Sterling. There was a cluster of two or three shots, and the officers rolled off.\n\nThe police yelled: \"Get on the ground,\" Muflahi said. \"Why were they telling him to get on the ground? He was already on the ground. They had shot him three times.\"\n\nThere was a second burst of three shots, and as Sterling lay with blood pooling on his chest, an officer appeared to reach into Sterling's pocket and pull out what Muflahi said was a gun.\n\nMuflahi kept his mobile phone video a secret, fearing the police would take it from him if they knew he had it. In short order, he said, police confiscated the security camera footage from his store.\n\nVeda Washington, Sterling's aunt, arrived later. She had helped raise Sterling, and when Sterling's mother died in 1996 when he was a teenager, she took him in. When she arrived at the scene, she alternated between chanting now-familiar slogans like \"Black lives matter\" and wailing in mourning for the nephew she regarded as a son.\n\n\"I've been sick ever since they murdered him,\" she cried.\n\nThe three people at the center of the scene all shared one thing: they can't sleep.\n\n\"I've tried to sleep but I can't. I just keep replaying it in my mind,\" Muflahi said. \"Seeing my friend shot. Hearing the police yelling. Seeing his eyes roll back in his head.\"\n\nCarr said she can't close her eyes without feeling a weight of guilt descend on her. \"He wouldn't have stayed if I hadn't asked him for that stupid movie,\" she said. \"He would be alive now.\"\n\nThe officers, Salamoni and Lake, have been placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard practice for officers involved in shootings. Salamoni's father is a high-ranking member of the Baton Rouge police \u2013 commander of the department's special operations division. In 2009, before he became a police officer, Salamoni was charged with disturbing the peace, but the charge was dropped. The other officer, Lake, was involved in another shooting in 2014, when investigators say he and five other officers returned fire at a suspect.\n\nBoth officers say their body cameras fell off before Tuesday's shooting. On Wednesday morning, the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, announced the state was handing over the investigation to federal authorities after calls for transparency from community leaders and Sterling's family.\n\nBy Wednesday night, the mood among protesters at the Triple S was, at first, tense. People expressed anger, disillusionment with the police, and fear. Someone set up a makeshift podium in the parking lot, and a public address system. The protest organizers played gospel music, and the mood of the crowd quickly shifted as people started to sing along.\n\nVeda Washington climbed up on the soda crates that served as a stage, and took the microphone.\n\n\"I was OK until I saw that second video,\" she said. \"I'm mad. I'm so mad. I'm angry.\"\n\n\"But I'm not so angry that I will cuss out the police. Not so mad that I'll go into the street. Let's be peaceful in our protest.\"",
    " Title: House and Senate Move Towards Comprehensive Legislation to Address Opioid Epidemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant step towards addressing the growing opioid epidemic, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a comprehensive bill on Friday, receiving overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill, which aims to combat the prescription drug crisis that has surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death from overdoses, passed with a vote of 400-5. This is the last of 18 pieces of bipartisan legislation the House passed this week to address the drug crisis.\n\nThe abuse of opioids, synthetic painkillers, has become a significant issue in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 28,000 people died from overdoses from these drugs in 2014, and overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999.\n\nThe legislation passed by the House aims to fight the crisis in various ways, including helping pregnant mothers who suffer from addiction, increasing access to naloxone (a drug that can reverse the effects of an overdose), and creating a task force of patients, medical officials, advocacy groups, and federal agencies to establish guidelines for prescribing pain medication.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy emphasized the importance of the legislation at a press conference attended by two dozen Republican lawmakers. \"This has been a very big week in the House. Addiction divides families. Addiction tears communities apart. Addiction takes lives,\" McCarthy said. \"This week, action was taken. It was a bipartisan action.\"\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan has made the issue a top priority, highlighting the legislation multiple times throughout the week. In a press conference with House leadership, he invited Reps. Susan Brooks of Indiana and Robert Dold of Illinois, both of whom sponsored opioid measures that passed this week, to talk about the personal impact of the epidemic.\n\nThe Senate passed comprehensive legislation in March, which would authorize $725 million in grants for state and local governments to strengthen drug monitoring, improve addiction treatment, and expand prevention, education, and law enforcement efforts. The bill the House passed on Friday brings together the different measures passed throughout the week into one comprehensive package.\n\nThe House and Senate are expected to quickly create a conference committee to iron out the differences between their measures and send the legislation to President Obama, who is expected to sign it. Despite the overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle, issues of funding remain. The White House proposed $1.1 billion in new funding to combat the addiction problem, but while the current legislation calls for a lesser amount, it doesn't actually provide the funding.\n\nDemocrats in both chambers of Congress attempted to pass amendments that would have provided $600 million in funding, but Republicans blocked both efforts and plan to iron out the issue in the regular appropriations process later this year. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the author of the Senate's opioid legislation, has been aggressively pushing the House since his bill passed in March to act more swiftly and in a comprehensive way on this issue. Portman is confident the House and Senate versions can be brought together into a single comprehensive bill and sent to the president's desk soon.",
    " Title: Allegations of Plagiarism Surface as Buttigieg's Speech Styles Compared to Obama's\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, imitation may be considered a form of flattery, but for Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, it seems to be raising questions of plagiarism. The former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor is being criticized for his speech style, which appears to closely resemble that of former President Barack Obama in more than one instance.\n\nOver the weekend, Fox News highlighted a tweet sent out by Buttigieg, where he wrote: \"If we can light up a high school gym\u2014we can light a neighborhood. If we can light up a neighborhood\u2014we can light a city. If we can light up a city\u2014we can light up our country.\" This tweet was compared to a tweet from Obama in 2012, where the president wrote: \"One voice can change a room. And if it can change a room, it can change a city. And if it can change a city, it can change a state.\"\n\nCo-host of \"The View\" Meghan McCain commented, \"Oh COME ON! I know Pete thinks he's the next Obama, but this is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Buttigieg campaign responded to Fox News, stating that the tweet was in reference to an event earlier on the campaign trail where the lights went out, and attendees used their cellphones as lights.\n\nParkland survivor and conservative activist Kyle Kashuv accused Buttigieg of making a habit of mimicking Obama and further claimed the presidential candidate was plagiarizing while sharing a mash-up of similarities between Buttigieg and Obama's speeches. Kashuv tweeted a video made by The Recount with the message, \"So it turns out Pete Buttigieg is just blatantly plagiarizing Barack Obama. Cmon man at least come up [with] your own platitudes...\"\n\nLiberals also noticed the pattern. Another clip of Buttigieg using similar language to Obama was shared by a writer for Common Dreams, a publication that touts itself as \"providing breaking news & views for the progressive community.\"\n\nThe allegations of plagiarism have sparked a debate on social media, with some defending Buttigieg as simply using common phrases and others accusing him of copying Obama's style too closely. The Buttigieg campaign has yet to respond to the specific allegations of plagiarism.",
    " Title: White House Prevents CDC Director from Testifying on School Reopening Amidst Ongoing Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has barred the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, from testifying before Congress regarding the reopening of schools during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that Redfield would not be appearing at the hearing for the House Committee on Education and Labor's Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, scheduled for July 23.\n\nFollowing the announcement, House Education Committee Chairman Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the lawmaker who requested Redfield's presence at the hearing, released a statement, expressing his disapproval of the White House's decision.\n\n\"It is alarming that the Trump administration is preventing the CDC from appearing before the Committee at a time when its expertise and guidance is so critical to the health and safety of students, parents, and educators,\" Scott said in the statement.\n\nHe further criticized the White House's \"lack of transparency\" at such a critical point during the pandemic, as \"difficult decisions\" are being made regarding schools.\n\n\"This lack of transparency does a great disservice to the many communities across the country facing difficult decisions about reopening schools this fall,\" Scott added.\n\nScott also condemned the White House for \"prioritizing politics over science.\"\n\n\"The administration's strategy of prioritizing politics over science has had a devastating impact on our country throughout this pandemic,\" Scott said. \"It should not make that same mistake when it comes to reopening schools.\"\n\nDespite the pushback from Democratic lawmakers, the White House is maintaining its decision to deny Redfield from testifying.\n\n\"Dr. Redfield has testified on the Hill at least four times over the last three months. We need our doctors focused on the pandemic response,\" a White House spokesperson said on Friday.\n\nThe White House's decision comes amid ongoing deliberations about reopening schools in the fall. As more than 38 states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases, President Donald Trump has continued to demand schools reopen in the fall.\n\nWhen the CDC released its guidelines for safely reopening schools, the president took to Twitter, criticizing their recommendations as \"very tough and expensive.\" Trump also demanded that they revise the guidelines. Redfield, however, made it clear afterward that the CDC does not plan to revise its guidelines but instead plans to provide more information.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, there are more than 3.7 million known coronavirus cases in the United States, with the death toll surpassing 142,000 and over 1.7 million reported recoveries.",
    " Title: White House Decision on Encryption: Government to Seek Alternative Methods for Data Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the White House has decided to refrain from compelling technology giants like Apple and Google to breach the security of their products during criminal and national security investigations. Instead, investigators will have to rely on alternative methods to obtain data, such as data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted over phone lines.\n\nThe decision, made a week ago, goes beyond simply maintaining the status quo. The administration will continue to engage with these companies in an attempt to facilitate cooperation during investigations. However, the government will not force them to breach the security of their products, as such actions are not covered by the law affecting telecommunications providers.\n\nLast year, FBI Director James Comey expressed alarm when Apple introduced an operating system that encrypted virtually all data on an iPhone. The concern stemmed from the fact that Apple had designed the system to ensure that the company never held onto the keys, giving users control through the codes or fingerprints they use to access their phones. As a result, if Apple is handed a court order for data, it cannot open the coded information.\n\nComparing this system to a door that law enforcement cannot enter or a car trunk they cannot unlock, Comey's concerns about the so-called \"going dark\" problem received support from the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence officials.\n\nAfter a year of study and extensive White House debate, President Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to compel companies to give the government access would fail, both politically and technologically.\n\n\"This looks promising, but there's still going to be tremendous pressure from law enforcement,\" said Peter G. Neumann, one of the nation's leading computer scientists and a co-author of a paper that examined the government's proposal for special access. \"The NSA is capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.\"",
    " Title: Incumbents on Defense as Domestic and Overseas Crises Mount in Election Year\n\nArticle:\n\nIncumbents are finding themselves on the defensive as the 2014 midterm elections approach, with a series of crises both domestically and abroad making it difficult for them to focus on their campaign messages. The current election year, already challenging for incumbents, has become even more difficult due to a string of issues, including the Ebola virus, ISIS, and a volatile stock market.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was forced to cancel several campaign appearances this week to remain in Washington to oversee the Ebola response. The growing troubles are upending plans for the final stretch before the Nov. 4 election that will determine which party will control the Senate.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University, described the current situation as \"a pretty bad one.\" He noted that the president and the country are facing a multitude of problems, including the Ebola virus, ISIS, and a volatile stock market.\n\nChristopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican consultant in Pennsylvania, compared the current election cycle to the \"six-year itch\" election when George W. Bush's unpopularity led to a \"thumpin\" for his party. \"October 2014 is starting to remind me of October 2006, which in my professional time was the worst cycle for Republicans, and the best for Democrats,\" Nicholas said.\n\nBack in 2006, Bush's Republicans, like Obama's Democrats, were also unable to catch a break. Powerless in the face of the sectarian explosion engulfing Iraq, and scarred by Hurricane Katrina, Bush limped into the elections and Democrats marched off with the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nToday, Democrats in tough elections do not want to be seen with Obama, and Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes has refused to say if she voted for the president. The gloomy October is making it easier for Republicans to press their case against Obama and incumbent Democrats.\n\n\"This administration could not run the IRS right, and it apparently is not running the CDC right,\" Mitt Romney told New Hampshire's NH-1 television station on Wednesday. \"And you ask yourself what is it going to take to have a president who really focuses on the interests of the American people?\"\n\nDire warnings about the threat from Ebola and the administration's response have been percolating on conservative talk radio for weeks. But it took the infection of two nurses to insert the issue into the midterms.\n\nIn a Colorado Senate debate on Wednesday, GOP Rep. Cory Gardner demanded action amid Republican calls for a travel ban covering the epicenter of Ebola in West Africa. \"If the president is not willing to put into a place a travel ban, then we should have 100 percent screening of the people who are coming from those affected areas,\" Gardner said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Udall, trailing Gardner in the Rocky Mountain state, hit back by accusing his opponent of complicity in budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPotential Republican 2016 challengers are also pitching in, despite Obama's assurances that the chances of catching Ebola are \"extraordinarily\" low. \"The Obama administration has downplayed how transmissible it is,\" Senator Rand Paul said in an interview with CNN Thursday. \"If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party, they're contagious and you can catch it from them.\"\n\nIn an article for CNN.com, Marco Rubio laid out \"5 steps to beat Ebola.\" \"This challenge will only be made more difficult because many Americans lack confidence in our government's ability to effectively confront crises like this one,\" he said.\n\nFew charges are as damaging for a president as the sense he has lost control, and the cascade of dramas over the last six weeks or so has often left the White House struggling to catch up. The multiple crises have also played into a critique that the president is too passive and reacts to, rather than dictates, events.\n\nThere is also trouble for the White House abroad in the run-up to the mid-terms, and Republicans also see an opening against Obama and incumbent Democrats in the fight against ISIS. In one spot, New Hampshire senatorial candidate Scott Brown warned \"radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country. President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, stock market losses complicate Democratic attempts to highlight what good economic news there is out there\u2014including increasingly robust jobs growth and a dip in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, the lowest level in six years.

    " Title: House Approves School Security Measures Bill, Falls Short on Gun Control Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. House of Representatives has approved a bill on Wednesday that increases funding for metal detectors, locks, and other school security measures, but has not made any significant strides in tightening gun control laws, a month after the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe bill, which allocates $50 million to $75 million per year from 2019 through 2028 for school security and safety training, was passed with a vote of 407-10. However, no parallel measure is currently pending in the Senate, where a more ambitious bill is being debated.\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, stated, \"This bill, on its own, is not the kind of meaningful congressional action needed to address this crisis of gun violence.\" He emphasized the need for legislation that expands background checks and bans military-style assault weapons.\n\nThe House bill does not allow any of the funding to be used for arming teachers or other school personnel. The White House has expressed support for the bill, but has also suggested that it would be improved by lifting the restriction on arming school personnel.\n\nSince the Parkland massacre, student protesters have successfully lobbied for tighter gun controls in Florida. Hundreds of them gathered outside the Capitol to urge Congress to take action on placing new limits on firearms and gun sales.\n\nIn the Senate, a bill to strengthen existing background checks of gun purchasers is currently being debated. This bill enjoys broad bipartisan support but has not been scheduled for debate.\n\nCongressional aides have reported that discussions are underway about folding the school safety and background check bills into a government funding bill that lawmakers want to pass by March 23.\n\nEleven organizations, including some gun control and law enforcement groups, have written to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, urging the passage of the background checks bill this month.\n\nSince the Florida shooting, the Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration have considered measures to curb gun violence while trying to avoid crossing the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group or threatening the right to bear arms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.\n\nNeither the House nor Senate bills address many of the gun control initiatives backed by students, teachers, and families of shooting victims at the Florida school. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Katherine Posada, a teacher at the school, recounted the horror she experienced the day of the shooting and urged Congress to ban assault-style weapons like the AR-15 rifle used by Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the murders.\n\n\"Some of the victims were shot through doors, or even through walls \u2013 a knife can\u2019t do that,\" Posada said. \"How many innocent lives could have been saved if these weapons of war weren\u2019t so readily available?\"",
    " Title: Three Missing Women Found Alive in Cleveland After Decade-Long Ordeal\n\nA dramatic turn of events unfolded in Cleveland on Monday evening, as three young women who had been missing for several years were found alive inside a home. The women, Amanda Berry (27), Gina DeJesus (23), and Michelle Knight (32), were discovered following a frantic plea for help from Berry, which alerted a neighbor to their plight.\n\nKey Developments:\n\n* Three young women, Amanda Berry (27), Gina DeJesus (23), and Michelle Knight (32) were found Monday evening at a home in Cleveland after Berry's frantic cries for help brought a neighbor to the door. With them was a 6-year-old girl who police say is Berry's daughter.\n* The three women, all from the Cleveland area, had been missing for many years - Knight since 2002, Berry since 2003, and DeJesus since 2004. They have all been treated and released at a Cleveland-area hospital.\n* Three brothers have been arrested, but not yet charged, in relation to the women's disappearances. They are: 52-year-old Ariel Castro, 54-year-old Pedro Castro, and 50-year-old Onil Castro.\n* As of midday Tuesday, authorities had not released any details about what they found inside the home or exactly what they've learned from the three women.\n\nThe women are Amanda Berry (27), Gina DeJesus (23), and Michelle Knight (32), whose disappearances generated much attention in local media over the past decade. Three brothers in their 50s have been arrested. According to The Associated Press, Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King. About a year later, DeJesus vanished at age 14 on her way home from school. Police said Knight disappeared in 2002 and is 32 now. They are being treated at a Cleveland area hospital, where they're reported to be in fair condition.\n\nAs Tuesday dawns, we're learning more about how the women were discovered and what neighbors say about the man who they would see coming and going from the home. From 'Morning Edition': Three missing women found alive in Cleveland, a frantic 911 call from Amanda Berry, and a neighbor's account of her cries for help, have been widely reported.\n\nThe three suspects - 52-year-old Ariel Castro, 54-year-old Pedro Castro, and 50-year-old Onil Castro - are in custody and expected to be charged within the next 36 hours. As of now, their records show there were never any calls for service to Ariel Castro's home on Seymour Avenue, the location where the three women were rescued Monday evening. Police say Ariel worked as a Cleveland Schools bus driver, and was questioned once in connection with a child left on the bus, but no charges were ever filed in relation to the incident. The three women appear to be in good condition and were released from Metro Health Hospital earlier this morning.\n\nThe story is still developing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.",
    " Title: President Obama to Highlight Progress in Veterans Affairs, but Scandals and Mismanagement Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Veterans Day, President Obama will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and discuss his administration's progress in caring for veterans. However, critics of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) point to fresh scandals and ongoing mismanagement as evidence that little has changed.\n\nWhite House officials announced on Tuesday that Mr. Obama will emphasize progress in five areas for veterans, including reducing the backlog of benefits claims, increasing access to healthcare services, and decreasing homelessness among veterans. In conjunction with Mr. Obama's announcements, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe is set to declare that his state is the first to eliminate veterans' homelessness statewide.\n\nThe President will also call on Congress to act on three pieces of legislation to expand education benefits for veterans.\n\nHowever, problems within the VA continue to persist. An internal VA audit has found that secret waitlists occurred not only in Phoenix but at 110 VA facilities.\n\nVA officials have yet to correct a computer system error that led to tens of thousands of combat veterans being denied VA health care enrollment, an issue that was brought to light in August.\n\nThe administration has attempted, under VA Secretary Robert McDonald, to move beyond the crisis that erupted in Phoenix in April 2014 over delayed health care for veterans and phony waitlists, which led to the resignation of former Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. The agency claims it has handled about 7 million more health care appointments for veterans in the past 12 months than in the previous year.\n\n\"Because of many of the reforms that Secretary McDonald has put into place, we have seen important progress made at the VA when it comes to ensuring that our veterans have access to the health care and benefits that they deserve,\" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nNearly 18 months after the waitlist scandal broke in Phoenix, the problems there are not resolved. An inspector general's report in October found that seven more Phoenix-area veterans died after delayed treatment and lapses in medical care.\n\nMr. McDonald also acknowledged during a House hearing last month that his department is suffering \"a leadership crisis.\" In September, for example, one of his top deputies resigned under pressure from congressional investigators looking into a scandal over padding the salaries and relocation expenses of senior VA managers. Five VA officials invoked their Fifth Amendment rights at a House Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing last week in connection with the probe.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jeff Miller, Florida Republican, said the VA is still suffering from a culture that fails to hold wrongdoing accountable.\n\n\"Until the VA rids itself of those who engage in scandalous behavior, the department will always be mired in scandal,\" Mr. Miller wrote in an op-ed in The Hill Tuesday. \"But unfortunately, indefensible civil service rules that put the job security of failing VA bureaucrats ahead of the safety of the veterans they are charged with serving are prolonging the agency's problems indefinitely.\"\n\nPete Hegseth, president of Concerned Veterans for America, says the VA under Mr. McDonald \"is not fundamentally serious about fixing the systematic problems plaguing the department.\"\n\nGovernment watchdogs in the past year have found numerous additional cases of VA whistleblowers facing retaliation, and of VA leadership failing to discipline those responsible for mismanagement or dangerous health care practices.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel wrote directly to Mr. Obama on Sept. 17 about continued problems at the Phoenix VA Medical Center, including the lack of training of emergency room nurses and substandard care at other facilities.\n\nOSC head Carolyn Lerner told the President that the lack of accountability for the problems in Phoenix \"sends the wrong message to the veterans served by this facility, including those who received substandard emergency care.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she said, the VA continues to go after employee whistleblowers with a vengeance.\n\n\"The VA has attempted to fire or suspend whistleblowers for minor indiscretions and, often, for activity directly related to the employee's whistleblowing,\" she told Mr. Obama.\n\nIn a speech last week at the National Press Club, Mr. McDonald claimed that the VA has \"proposed disciplinary action against 300 individuals for manipulating scheduling.\"\n\n\"I just wish that there would be more fact-checking on some of the numbers that are used, because there are a lot of myths out there,\" he added.\n\nHowever, his claim is dubious. The VA's own statistics submitted to Congress showed that, as of last week, there were proposed disciplinary actions against 27 employees and one senior executive specifically for patient wait-time manipulation. Of those 27, three have been fired. Sharon Helman, the Phoenix VA medical center director, was fired for accepting improper gifts, not because of her role in the waitlist scandal.\n\nThe department has proposed disciplinary action against 305 employees for various issues, including 20 probationary workers and other non-medical employees such as food service workers and transportation supervisors.\n\nFunding for the VA has increased 73 percent since 2009, but examples of waste at the agency are rampant. Construction of a VA hospital in Denver is more than $1 billion over budget. And an investigation earlier this year uncovered that a VA executive received almost $300,000 in relocation expenses to move from Washington to Philadelphia.",
    " Title: Public Opinion on Supreme Court Interpretation of Constitution Split Along Party, Age, and Demographic Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate in the Senate over Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court has brought to light the deep-seated partisan and ideological divisions within Congress and the public regarding the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution by the high court.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in October, approximately half of the public (46%) believes the Supreme Court should make its rulings based on the Constitution's original meaning, while an equal proportion (46%) thinks the court should base its decisions on the Constitution's interpretation in contemporary times. This divide has remained relatively consistent over the years.\n\nThe survey reveals stark differences in views between Republicans and Democrats. About 74% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor the court basing its rulings on the Constitution's original meaning, while 23% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents hold the same view. This gap is slightly wider than it was in February 2014, when 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners and 27% of Democrats and Democratic leaners favored the originalist interpretation.\n\nThe survey also highlights significant differences in opinions by age, race and ethnicity, education, and religious affiliation. Young adults (under 30) favor a contemporary interpretation of the Constitution by a margin of 63% to 31%, while those aged 30 to 49 are more divided (44% original meaning, 45% contemporary interpretation). A 54% majority of those 50 and older prefer the court's rulings to be based on the Constitution's original meaning.\n\nRacial and ethnic differences are also evident, with blacks (63%) more likely than whites (41%) to favor a contemporary interpretation. Education level also plays a role, with adults with at least a college degree, particularly those with postgraduate degrees, more likely to favor a contemporary interpretation.\n\nReligious affiliation also influences opinions, with white evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly favoring the court basing its rulings on the Constitution's original meaning (79%). In contrast, among the religiously unaffiliated, 64% think the court's decisions should be based on the Constitution's contemporary meaning, while 30% favor the originalist interpretation.\n\nThis survey underscores the deep divisions in the American public regarding the interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court, with these divisions cutting across party lines, age, race, education, and religious affiliation.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Mixed Reviews for President-elect Donald Trump's Transition and Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo weeks after the election, a new CNN/ORC Poll reveals a divided American public regarding President-elect Donald Trump's performance during the transition and his expected presidency.\n\nThe poll indicates that a narrow majority, 53 percent, believe Trump will do a good job as president, while 40 percent approve of his handling of the transition so far. This approval rating is lower than the way previous presidents-elect were perceived during their transitions to the presidency.\n\nIn terms of policy priorities, a majority of Americans expect Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare (74 percent), renegotiate NAFTA (66 percent), and create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas (60 percent). The economy is expected to be in good shape a year from now, according to 63 percent of respondents, the highest share since September 2012.\n\nHowever, Americans are more divided over whether Trump will \"drain the swamp\" and reduce corruption in Washington (51 percent), defeat ISIS (50 percent), or build a wall along the border with Mexico (48 percent).\n\nThe poll suggests that a Trump presidency will bring change to the country, but opinions on whether it will be change for the better are divided. Only 43 percent of Americans believe it will be change for the better, a significant drop compared to the 63 percent who thought President Obama would bring change for the better in November 2008.\n\nTrump's favorability has risen post-election to a high point in CNN/ORC polling, with 47 percent having a favorable view of him, and 50 percent unfavorable. Despite the negative tilt, these ratings outpace the previous high reached just after the GOP convention in July, when 43 percent saw Trump favorably.\n\nOn one point of concern, few say Trump's efforts have gone far enough to assuage their worries about potential conflicts of interest. About 6 in 10 say the arrangement Trump has proposed for handling his business while serving as president\u2014to have his adult children run the Trump Organization\u2014does not go far enough to prevent conflicts.\n\nThe poll suggests that Trump is shaping up to be one of the most polarizing presidents-elect in recent years. While there is relatively high confidence in his ability to deal with the economy, there is also an outsized lack of confidence and a diminished middle ground.\n\nOn handling foreign affairs, confidence in Trump is sharply upside-down, yet still, few land in the middle. Almost half (49 percent) say they have no real confidence, while 27 percent say they have a lot of faith in the president-elect. Just 23 percent say they have \"some confidence.\"\n\nOverall, Trump ranks toward the middle of the pack on providing leadership and making appointments, but his no-confidence numbers far outpace those for his predecessors. On providing real leadership, 33 percent have deep confidence, but 43 percent say they have no confidence. And thinking about appointing the best people to office, 32 percent say they have a lot of confidence in Trump, yet 45 percent say they have no confidence in him to choose appointees.\n\nThese numbers could shift as Trump fills out his cabinet and staff; polling measuring confidence in previous presidents-elect was conducted closer to their inauguration after many critical appointments had been made.\n\nSeveral demographic divides that emerged during the campaign appear to persist post-election. Women are less apt to see Trump as a good president than are men, and residents of rural areas are more than twice as likely as urbanites to think Trump will do a good job. Among those in union households, a typically Democratic constituency where Trump had stronger appeal than most Republicans, 53 percent expect Trump to do a good job as president.\n\nOverall, the share saying things in the US are going well today has dipped from its late-October high, with 47 percent saying things are going well, down from 54 percent then. That shift is mostly partisan. While there has been an uptick in the share of Republicans who think things are going well (from 21 percent to 32 percent), the share of Democrats who say the same has dropped about twenty points (85 percent to 66 percent).\n\nAbout half of Americans overall say that four years from now, they expect the country to be better off than it is today, 46 percent say it'll be worse off, and just 3 percent say it'll be the same. That's worse than impressions of how the country would be after four years of Obama, but a little better than assessments of how it'd be doing four years into George W. Bush's presidency.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Criticism of Clinton's Campaign, Dismisses Soft Foreign Policy Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary Clinton's campaign success is based largely on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy.\n\nIn an interview on \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday,\" Trump stated, \"The only card she has is the woman card.\" He further added, \"Even women don't like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race.\"\n\nTrump's comments come after his sweeping victory in five Northeast primary contests on Tuesday, where he said, \"The only card she has is the woman's card. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.\"\n\nThe front-running Trump also dismissed criticism that he sounded like a liberal Democrat in his foreign policy speech last week, suggesting the United States scale back in the Middle East and focus on domestic spending.\n\n\"We need to knock off ISIS and get out of there,\" said Trump, who nevertheless continues to argue that overthrowing dictators has been a failed foreign policy strategy that has led to instability in the Middle East.\n\n\"Every move we've made in the Middle East has been wrong,\" he said, arguing other countries should pay more to protect the world and that more taxpayer money must go to U.S. infrastructure.\n\n\"We can't have this anymore,\" he said. \"We are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We need to strengthen our military and pull back \u2026 In the meantime, our country is becoming Third World.\"\n\nTrump also stated, \"I will be tougher than Clinton.\"\n\nGOP primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump's policy speech \"reflects a weak and naive approach to foreign policy.\"\n\nTrump also argued that his attacks on Clinton are no worse than those of her primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has questioned Clinton's qualifications.\n\nWhile both Clinton and Trump's favorability ratings among women are low, Trump's are worse, especially among female general election voters. However, Trump argued Sunday that his numbers will improve if and when he faces Clinton in the general election.\n\n\"Once I start on Hillary, the numbers will change,\" he said. \"Watch what happens with Hillary. Watch what happens with her numbers.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats Introduce Resolution to Block President Trump's National Emergency Declaration, Setting Up Potential First Veto\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at countering President Trump's national emergency declaration along the U.S.-Mexico border, House Democrats have introduced a resolution to block the executive order. The resolution, spearheaded by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), has garnered overwhelming support from fellow majority Democrats in the House.\n\nThe resolution, which currently boasts 222 cosponsors, was announced overnight by Rep. Castro, who denounced the move as a \"FakeTrumpEmergency\" and the border wall the president seeks to fund. By Friday morning, Castro reported additional support, including from Republican Rep. Justin Amash.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) voiced her disapproval of the president's actions during a press call with Castro, stating, \"The President is dishonoring the office in which he serves.\"\n\nThe level of support for the resolution suggests it will likely pass the House. However, the Republican-controlled Senate could also follow suit, potentially leading to a significant divide within the party over the president's decision. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has already expressed her support for such a measure, and other Republicans have voiced concern over the emergency declaration.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues, Pelosi argued, \"We have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Constitution, and defend our system of checks and balances against the President's assault.\" She continued, \"All Members take an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. The President's decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated.\"\n\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, maintains that the wall is necessary to protect the country from illegal immigration, crime, and drugs. He has highlighted construction already underway and has pledged to continue with more as he braces for both a congressional and legal battle.\n\nIn response to a lawsuit launched earlier this week by more than a dozen Democrat-led states, Trump criticized \"Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left.\" The brief resolution filed Friday simply states, \"The national emergency declaration is hereby terminated.\"\n\nThe resolution was introduced during a short pro forma session of the House, with Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) presiding over an almost empty chamber. Pelosi has promised that the House will \"move swiftly\" to pass the measure, predicting that the resolution will be referred to the Senate and then sent to the President's desk.\n\nPresident Trump declared the emergency last Friday, a decision tied to his signing of a government spending package that averted a second shutdown. While that package included $1.4 billion for 55 miles of border barrier \u2013 significantly less than Trump sought \u2013 Trump aims to use the emergency declaration and other tools to secure billions more. The funds would be transferred from a federal asset forfeiture fund, Defense Department anti-drug efforts, and a military construction fund. Federal officials have yet to identify which projects would be affected.",
    " Title: Former U.S. President Barack Obama Endorses Justin Trudeau Amid Blackface Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former U.S. President Barack Obama has endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for re-election, amidst the latter's recent blackface controversy.\n\nTrudeau, who is seeking to remain prime minister after next week's elections, has been embroiled in a scandal following the release of photos and videos showing him in blackface or brownface for various costumes. Trudeau has apologized for his actions, but has not been able to confirm that those were the only instances he had engaged in such behavior.\n\nIn a tweet, Obama wrote, \"I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\"\n\nObama and Trudeau have been friends since Trudeau was elected in 2015, and the two leaders have been compared to one another at times. Their friendship has continued even after Obama left office in 2017.\n\nObama's endorsement of a former blackface-wearing Canadian prime minister has raised some eyebrows, particularly in contrast to Obama's handling of U.S. presidential primaries, in which he has not publicly endorsed any candidate, not even his former vice president, Joe Biden.\n\nThe endorsement has sparked debate in Canada, with some citizens expressing discomfort over the endorsement as a form of foreign election interference. Drew Fagan, a professor of public policy at the Munk School of Global Affairs, called it \"unusual.\" However, there is no evidence of actual interference at this time.\n\nElections Canada spokeswoman Natasha Gauthier told the BBC, \"Whether expenses were incurred, who incurred them and for what reason would be among the factors that need to be considered before determining if undue foreign influence has taken place.\"\n\nObama has endorsed foreign leaders in the past, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The full implications of Obama's endorsement on the Canadian elections remain to be seen.",

The bill, which passed with a vote of 68-32, is now set to move to the House of Representatives for further consideration.\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisan cooperation, the Senate chamber saw senators vote one by one as the roll was called, with Vice President Biden presiding over the proceedings. Despite a pre-vote admonition from Biden asking the gallery to refrain from overt expressions of approval or disapproval, the gallery could not help but chant \"yes we can\" as the vote neared.\n\nThe bill fell short of the symbolically significant 70-vote threshold, but still significantly outperformed the 51 votes required for passage today. Fourteen members of the Republican conference crossed the aisle to join with Democratic support, while every 'no' vote was cast by a Republican.\n\nThe only real debate this week was among Republicans, with Senators Marco Rubio and Jeff Sessions delivering dueling closing floor arguments in support of and against the bill's passage, respectively.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has already stated that he will ignore the Senate-passed bill, and even Sen. Marco Rubio, a key proponent of the bill, has signaled support for the creation and passage of a distinct House bill. The Senate saga has come to a close, and the focus now shifts to the House, which may not begin the process for some time.\n\nUPDATE: The following is a list of the Republican senators who voted in favor of the bill: Alexander (TN), Ayotte (NH), Chisea (NJ), Collins (ME), Corker (TN), Flake (AZ), Graham (SC), Hatch (UT), Heller (NV), Hoeven (ND), Kirk (IL), McCain (AZ), Rubio (FL), Murkowski (AK).\n\nHouse Deputy Whip Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) has stated that passing the Senate bill is a \"pipe dream\" in his chamber. House Republicans have expressed a preference for immigration reform that prioritizes \"real border security,\" according to House Speaker John Boehner. The immigration reform process now moves to the House, where the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Congress Approves Fiscal Crisis Package Laden with Special-Interest Tax Breaks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a last-minute deal, Congress has approved a fiscal crisis package aimed at preventing middle-class tax hikes, but the bill has been criticized for including numerous special-interest tax breaks worth approximately $76 billion. The package, which was passed earlier this week and signed by President Obama, extends more than 50 temporary tax breaks for another year.\n\nThe tax breaks, which were already in the law, were allowed to expire at the end of 2011 as lawmakers struggled to reach consensus on a wide range of tax issues. The package passed by Congress this week renews the tax breaks retroactively, allowing taxpayers to claim them on both their 2012 and 2013 tax returns.\n\nAmong the tax breaks included in the package are:\n\n* A rule allowing TV and film producers to write off the first $15 million in production costs inside the U.S., valued at $248 million over 10 years.\n* A provision allowing motorsport race tracks to more quickly write off improvement costs, valued at $78 million.\n* A 50 percent tax credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance through 2013, worth $331 million.\n* Increased tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States, worth $222 million over 10 years.\n* A tax credit of up to $2,500 for buying electric-powered vehicles, expanded to include electric-powered motorcycles, at a cost of $7 million.\n* A tax credit for the production of wind, solar, and other renewable energy, at a cost of $12.2 billion.\n\nWhile each industry defends their tax treatment as vital, critics argue that the inclusion of these tax breaks in the fiscal crisis package feeds \"cynicism.\" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) described the situation as \"tax incentives for NASCAR track builders,\" while Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) called the package a \"terrible vote to have to take.\"\n\nBoth senators, who approved the bill, have expressed their disapproval of the last-minute additions to the bill. \"It's hard to think of anything that could feed the cynicism of the American people more than larding up must-pass emergency legislation with giveaways to special interests and campaign contributors,\" said Sen. McCain in a statement.\n\nThe tax breaks in the package were already in the law, and were merely extended for another year by Tuesday's vote. Businesses have grown accustomed to many of the longstanding tax breaks, but they also have had to get used to the uncertainty of whether they will be renewed each year. This time around the tax breaks were allowed to expire at the end of 2011 as lawmakers struggled to reach consensus on a wide range of tax issues. The package passed by Congress this week and signed by President Obama renews the tax breaks retroactively, so taxpayers can claim them on both their 2012 and 2013 tax returns.",
    " Title: Release of Nunes Memo Sparks Controversy as Trump Claims Vindication in Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, President Donald Trump claimed that the release of a previously classified Republican memo, which alleges abuse by the FBI and Department of Justice, vindicates him in the ongoing Russia probe. The memo, released by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Friday, alleges that officials at the FBI and DOJ used bias against Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, ultimately leading to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate charges of collusion between aides working for then-candidate Trump and Russian officials.\n\nTrump approved the memo's release on Friday and said its revelations were a \"disgrace,\" adding, \"A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.\" Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), also on the House Intelligence Committee, called for public hearings about the FBI and Justice Department actions that led to FISA warrants allowing the surveillance of former Trump adviser Carter Page.\n\nHowever, the reaction among lawmakers was not unanimous. Fellow Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona blasted the memo's release, saying it served \"no American interests\" to make the information public. Democrats were mainly in unison in their condemnation of the Nunes memo, including House Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) who said it was \"deeply misleading and factually inaccurate.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also criticized the memo, releasing a statement on Friday calling it a \"desperate attempt to distract the American people from the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee are pushing to release their own memo and in a statement on Friday said the Nunes document failed to provide \"vital context.\" Trump said Friday he \"would be inclined\" to allow a Democratic rebuttal if it passed a \"security and legal review,\" according to a White House statement.\n\nDemocrats contend the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine the Mueller criminal probe that was launched in May 2017 as an outgrowth of an earlier FBI investigation. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Trump's decision to allow the release of the memo was \"part of a coordinated propaganda effort to discredit, disable and defeat the Russia investigation.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Nadler circulated a memo to House Democrats disputing the conclusions of the Nunes memo and arguing that Page was a lawful target of surveillance. \"Carter Page was, more likely than not, an agent of a foreign power. The Department of Justice thought so. A federal judge agreed,\" Nadler wrote in the memo. The ongoing controversy surrounding the release of the Nunes memo and the Russia investigation is expected to continue as both parties seek to shape the narrative surrounding the probe.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown: Uncertainty Looms as Senate Rejects House Legislation for Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the first federal government shutdown in 17 years continues, there is no clear indication of when negotiations will commence to resolve the impasse. On Tuesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected House legislation calling for a House-Senate conference to address the disagreement.\n\nSenate Democrats rejected the House request due to their opposition to Republican efforts to tie continued government funding to attempts to restrict the Affordable Care Act. Democrats maintain that they are open to revising Obamacare, but they are unwilling to do so under the threat of a government shutdown or debt default.\n\n\"No matter how many times they try to extort the American people and the Democrats here in the Senate, we're not going to re-litigate the health care issue,\" said Sen. Harry Reid on the Senate floor, explaining why his Democrats voted down the House request for a conference. \"We're not going to do that. If they have problems with [Obamacare], we'll be happy to sit down and talk with them about a reasonable approach to do that. But we're not going to with a gun to the heads of the American people.\"\n\nIt remains unclear what the next move will be for Speaker John Boehner and his House Republican conference. When the House reconvened Tuesday afternoon, Boehner did not offer a detailed plan for resolving the current crisis. \"Our country has big problems. Today our government has big problems,\" he told the House. \"The only way these problems are going to be resolved is if we sit down amicably and keep the American people in mind and come to an agreement.\"\n\nAnother uncertainty is how long the shutdown will last. Stan Collender, a partner at communications firm Qorvis and a former senior Capitol Hill aide, predicts the shutdown will last at least a week.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the longer the shutdown lasts, the more difficult it will be for Republicans compared with Democrats. One, Democrats, for the time being at least, appear to have the advantage of a unified front. In politics, a unified party tends to have more leverage than a splintered party. Congressional Democrats are not only unified but have the president with them.\n\nIn contrast, some Republicans are openly questioning the House GOP strategy. Reps. Peter King of New York and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, and Arizona Sen. John McCain, were among the congressional Republicans who expressed doubts.\n\nIf Democrats remain united around the position that there will be no talks until the House passes the Senate's \"clean\" spending bill and reopens the government, that would mean Boehner would need to capitulate before the shutdown can end. Capitulation in this case would mean relying on some of his Republicans and House Democrats to get the required 217 votes to pass the spending bill.\n\nThat would certainly be embarrassing and could lead to another House GOP revolt against his leadership. But he may not have a choice.\n\nTwo, Democrats also appear to have the advantage of public opinion, according to a new Quinnipiac poll, which found far more people opposing an Obamacare-induced government shutdown than favoring it \u2013 72 percent to 22 percent.\n\nRepublicans also have the burden of decades of anti-government rhetoric that will very likely make their attempts to blame the shutdown on Democrats a harder message for them to sell.\n\nEven now, with the shutdown newly upon the nation, the Republican message that Democrats were to blame was being muddied by GOP rhetoric. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said during a Fox News interview: \"You may see a partial shutdown for several days. People are going to realize they can live with a lot less government.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Race Heats Up as Labor Day Marks Intensification of 2020 White House Race\n\nAs the summer comes to a close and the 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential nomination race enters a more competitive phase, former Vice President Joe Biden's frontrunner status faces increased scrutiny. With five months remaining until the first nominating contest in Iowa, the vast field of candidates is yet to coalesce around a clear consensus choice.\n\nBiden, 76, has maintained a lead over his competitors, but his campaign has been marred by concerns over his age, fitness for office, and his moderate stance in a party that has grown increasingly liberal. These questions are likely to intensify in the coming weeks as the White House race enters a more fervent stage.\n\nLabor Day traditionally marks the start of the White House race's final stretch, with the first nominating contest in Iowa scheduled for February. The Democratic field, divided along ideological and generational lines, lacks a unifying candidate.\n\nWhile Biden enjoys widespread name recognition due to his eight-year tenure as Barack Obama's vice president and a long Senate career before that, his standing may weaken as voters focus on other candidates, according to strategists. This could provide an opportunity for Biden's closest competitors, U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or another contender, to gain momentum.\n\nJoel Payne, a Democratic operative who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, stated that Biden's position is the weakest for a frontrunner in a contested primary in a long time. Payne attributes Biden's standing primarily to voters' familiarity with him rather than his performance on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Democratic field has shrunk slightly in the past month, with U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand dropping out last week. However, 20 contenders remain in the race. Ten Democrats will face off on September 12 at a debate in Houston.\n\nDelacey Skinner, a Democratic strategist, noted that most people are not familiar with many of the candidates. Jeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist in Iowa, likened the primary-season campaign to an American football game, with Labor Day marking the start of the second half.\n\nBiden has faced criticism for his gaffes and memory lapses, which have raised concerns about his age and his ability to challenge Trump if he is the party's nominee. Biden is also viewed with skepticism by some Democrats who see him as an out-of-touch moderate in a party moving leftward.\n\nElizabeth Warren has emerged as a significant contender, particularly in Iowa, a state Biden needs to win to reinforce his argument that he is the candidate best equipped to take down Trump. However, questions persist about Warren's ambitious liberal agenda and her ability to attract moderate and black voters, as Biden does.\n\nSkinner believes Warren can broaden her appeal beyond siphoning liberal voters from Sanders and other candidates on the left. \"She actually is starting to draw moderates. She doesn't feel like a Bernie (Sanders). She doesn't feel like she's out to blow things up,\" Skinner said. \"I see her as someone who can draw supporters from Bernie and from Biden.\"\n\nAll top-tier contenders have faced questions about their ability to unite a deeply divided party and ultimately defeat Trump. Sanders, a self-described \"Democratic socialist,\" has seen his support wane compared to his 2016 presidential bid. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris had a promising start but has since fallen in the polls, struggling to articulate consistent policy stances.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke have faced criticism for their lack of national experience and their handling of race relations and policing in their respective cities.\n\nJoe Zepecki, a Democratic strategist in the general election battleground state of Wisconsin, noted that flawed candidates are common at this stage of the campaign, and eventually, the party will coalesce behind a nominee.\n\nWhile this may be true, the enduring questions surrounding Biden's age and fitness for office may mean Democrats will lack the \"safe\" choice they have had in the past, whether the candidate has been Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, or Hillary Clinton in 2008 and 2016.\n\nIowa's Link emphasized that the 2020 race remains fluid, and even lower-tier contenders such as U.S. Senator Cory Booker or O'Rourke could still make a charge. The objective for candidates at this stage, Link said, is to \"organize, organize, organize - and get hot at the end.\"",
    " Title: The Demise of The Weekly Standard: A Lament for a Writer's Magazine\n\nArticle:\n\nToday, the news of the closure of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine that has been a beacon for political opinion writing and clear-eyed journalism, has left a void in the literary and political landscape. The magazine, which has been a home to a unique blend of cultural criticism, unabashed idealism about America, seasoned realism about politics, and a sharp yet sympathetic disdain for the absurdities of elite institutions, is no more.\n\nThe magazine, which was founded in the mid-1990s, was more than just a venue for conservative political opinion writing or a platform for clear-eyed political journalism. It was, simply put, a writer's magazine, defined by the distinct intelligences of the extraordinary people in its orbit.\n\nThe magazine's strength lay in its ability to bring in great people and let them be great. From the elitist anti-elitism of David Brooks' cultural writing in its early days to the sharp young-fogey heterodoxy of Matt Continetti's political writing in its middle age, the magazine was an incredible incubator of great writing.\n\nThe magazine's in-house writers, such as Christopher Caldwell, John Podhoretz, Matt Labash, Jon Last, Andy Ferguson, and many others, have defined the magazine most throughout its span. Their writing, which ranged from cultural criticism to political analysis, was always thought-provoking and insightful.\n\nThe magazine's back of the book, which was dedicated to books and culture, was particularly noteworthy. Long, discursive essays on old books and new ideas, on faith and philosophy, on culture and technology, were a testament to the magazine's understanding that politics is downstream of culture.\n\nThe closure of The Weekly Standard is a loss not just for the conservative movement, but for the literary and journalistic world as a whole. It was a unique and special magazine that offered proof of Tom Paine's assertion that a magazine, when properly conducted, is the nursery of genius. This grateful reader gives his thanks to The Weekly Standard and its writers for their contributions to the literary and journalistic world.",
    " Title: States Race to Protect Abortion Rights as Supreme Court Prepares to Hear Landmark Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 47th year since the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, states across the nation are scrambling to protect women's right to choose in the face of a conservative Supreme Court that could potentially overturn the historic ruling.\n\nBonyen Lee-Gilmore, who works on state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood, acknowledges the challenging political climate, stating, \"The reality is that the balance of the Supreme Court is not in our favor. We have to be prepared [if] Roe falls. That's just part of the reality of living under the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe preparations began last year when New York became the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its state law, effectively codifying Roe v. Wade. Since then, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont have followed suit, passing similar laws protecting the right to an abortion. Michigan, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia are also considering codifying the right to an abortion. In 2019, statehouses passed more legislation protecting or expanding abortion access than in the entire previous decade.\n\nHowever, in contrast, red states have been preparing for a post-Roe world. In 2019, four states\u2014Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee\u2014passed trigger laws, which would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and 12 states passed abortion bans. In total, eight states now have trigger laws on the books, and 20 have laws that could be used to restrict the right to an abortion if Roe were overturned.\n\nAndrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, comments on the divergent paths states are taking, \"We have a group of states last year that were tripping over each other in a race to the bottom to try to ban abortion outright, and then we also had a real record year on the other side.\"\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, approximately 25 million women of reproductive age live in a state where abortion could be banned if Roe is overturned. Millions more are already subjected to hurdles to access abortions, including 72-hour waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and invasive ultrasound procedures.\n\nIn March, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since the confirmation of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, a stipulation that opponents of the bill argue would leave the state with only one provider for a population of more than 4.5 million. Although the justices are not expected to overturn Roe outright in this case, legal experts argue that if the court were to rule in favor of the law, access to abortion in states like Louisiana could exist in name only.",
    " Title: Former President Obama Criticizes Justice Department's Decision to Drop Charges Against Michael Flynn, Citing Threat to Rule of Law\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private conversation with former members of his administration, former President Barack Obama expressed concern over the Justice Department's decision to drop charges against President Trump's ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The former president's comments, leaked to Yahoo News, were reported on Saturday morning.\n\n\"The news over the last 24 hours I think has been somewhat downplayed\u2014about the Justice Department dropping charges against Michael Flynn,\" Obama said during a web conversation with members of the Obama Alumni Association. He continued, \"The fact that there is no precedent that anyone can find for someone who has been charged with making false statements to the FBI getting off scot-free... That's the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic\u2014not just institutional norms\u2014but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.\"\n\nThe former president misstated the charges against Flynn, who was accused of making false statements to the FBI, not perjury. In 2017, Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the then-Russian ambassador but later sought to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nObama cited the Flynn case as a critical reason to vote for his former Vice President, Joseph R. Biden, in the November election against President Trump. \"So I am hoping that all of you feel the same sense of urgency that I do,\" he told the group.\n\nA former president criticizing internal Justice Department decisions is rare, as former chief executives typically avoid wading into political waters. Obama's comments were among his strongest attacks on the Trump administration to date, suggesting that he may become more outspoken as this year's election approaches.\n\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department dropped the case against Flynn, stating that the FBI's 2017 interview with Flynn was not conducted with \"a legitimate investigative basis\" because three weeks earlier, the bureau sought to close the probe, saying it had not uncovered any wrongdoing. Anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok pushed to keep the case open, according to bombshell court documents released earlier this month.\n\nPresident Trump has pointed the finger at the Obama administration for the Flynn prosecution, which he has repeatedly blasted as corrupt. \"He was targeted by the Obama administration to try to take down a president,\" the president said of Flynn on Thursday. \"And I hope a big price is going to be paid.\" The president added, \"The Obama administration Justice Department was a disgrace, and they got caught. It's treason.\"",
    " Title: State Department Faces Delay in Releasing Clinton Emails Due to Classified Information\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department has admitted that the process of reviewing and releasing emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's tenure has been delayed due to the presence of potentially classified information in her communications. John F. Hackett, the top open records officer for the department, revealed this information in a court filing on Friday.\n\nAccording to Hackett, the government only recently became aware of the classified nature of the information in Clinton's emails, prompting them to consult with intelligence officers to ensure no sensitive information was being disclosed. The department was supposed to have released 15 percent of Clinton's emails by the end of July, but as of now, they have released less than 12 percent, falling short by approximately 1,721 pages of the target set by Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this year.\n\nClinton and her allies have consistently maintained that she did not conduct any classified business on her personal email account, which she used instead of the secure State Department account. However, an inspector general's report suggests that information classified at the time of Clinton's emails was sent was not appropriately handled.\n\nAs the emails are being released per Judge Contreras' orders, the State Department is now required to redact all classified information. All of Clinton's messages are government records and should have been stored at the State Department for open records searches. However, due to Clinton's unique arrangement of using a private server, these messages were not part of the official record for six years, preventing the State Department from conducting a comprehensive search.\n\nThe State Department only demanded Clinton return her emails in 2014, nearly two years after she left office. She complied, turning over 55,000 pages, representing about 30,000 messages. Clinton claims she deleted another 32,000 messages that were purely private, and maintains she is now in compliance with the law. She has refused to hand over her server, stating that it would be unnecessary because she had already wiped it clean of the emails.\n\nHackett estimates that the department can make up the 1,700-page deficit over the next two months, releasing 6,106 pages of emails in August and another 7,156 in September. This will still leave more than 60 percent of the messages to be released from October through January, the deadline set by Judge Contreras for all 30,000 messages to be made public.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Allegedly Paid Tech Expert to Manipulate Online Polls for Trump in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen is under scrutiny once again, following reports that he paid a technology expert to manipulate online polls in Trump's favor in 2015. According to The Wall Street Journal, John Gauger, the owner of Red Finch Solutions and chief information officer at Liberty University, said Cohen offered him $50,000 to manipulate two news sites' polls.\n\nGauger, who said Cohen handed him a Walmart bag loaded with about $12,000 in cash during a 2015 meeting at Cohen's Trump Organization office, claimed that Cohen never paid the remaining $38,000 of the promised $50,000. Cohen, however, denied giving Gauger cash, stating that all monies paid to Gauger were by check.\n\nThe manipulation attempts reportedly included swaying a CNBC online poll on the top American business leaders and a Drudge Report poll on potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates. Despite Cohen's efforts, Trump did not break into the top 100 in the CNBC poll, and he ended up coming in fifth with 5 percent of the vote in the Drudge Report poll.\n\nCohen also asked Gauger to create a Twitter account, @WomenForCohen, which was run by a female friend of Gauger's to portray Cohen as a \"sex symbol\" and hype his statements in favor of Trump's presidential campaign. The account, created in May 2016 and still active with just 527 followers as of Thursday morning, has since posted tweets praising Trump and Cohen.\n\nGauger said the last time he spoke to Cohen was in April 2018, after Cohen's office, home, and hotel room were raided by the FBI. Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison last month after pleading guilty to crimes related to tax evasion, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress.\n\nCohen's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has previously questioned Cohen's credibility, calling him \"pathetic\" and a \"serial liar.\" At his sentencing, Cohen said he committed his crimes out of \"blind loyalty\" to Trump and felt it was his \"duty to cover up his dirty deeds.\" Cohen is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee on February 7.",
    " Title: Tillerson Outlines Diplomatic and Military Options in Response to North Korea's Nuclear Program\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to South Korea on Friday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that the U.S. does not wish to engage in military action against North Korea, but all options, including diplomatic, security, and economic measures, are on the table if a serious threat arises. Tillerson's Asia tour began in Japan and will end in China.\n\nDuring his visit, Tillerson emphasized that the policy of strategic patience, which was a hallmark of the Obama administration's approach, has ended. He stated, \"We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, economic measures. All options are on the table.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential military action, Tillerson said that while the U.S. would prefer to avoid armed conflict, \"If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, then that option is on the table.\"\n\nJoseph DeTrani, former special envoy for six-party talks with North Korea, told NPR's Audie Cornish that Tillerson is being straightforward with China and regional allies in the Asia region about the U.S.'s approach. \"If there's an imminent strike against the United States, we have to look at all options on the table,\" DeTrani said.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear threat and recent missile tests have cast a long shadow over Tillerson's trip. In a news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday, the Korean peninsula was mentioned more than 40 times.\n\nOn Friday, concerns about North Korea prompted a missile evacuation drill on Japan's coast, where more than 100 residents of a town heard sirens and were told to take cover in an exercise that is seen as unprecedented.\n\nDeTrani told NPR that reactive measures are necessary, but creative and forward-leaning measures are also required to give North Korea opportunities to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. \"We've got to be as creative, we've got to be as forward-leaning as possible to give North Korea those off-ramps so they realize there are opportunities available to them that will not be available if they continue on the path of building nuclear and missile capabilities,\" he said.\n\nTillerson will head to China this weekend, where he is expected to push Beijing to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. He is also expected to plan for a visit by President Xi Jinping to meet with President Trump at his private club in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, next month, although that has not been formally announced yet.\n\nFor its part, China wants its relationship with the U.S. to remain stable, so as not to distract from a leadership reshuffle this fall.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Cases Set to Stir Political Debate as Presidential Race Heats Up\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 presidential race enters its final stages, the Supreme Court is preparing to tackle a series of contentious issues that have been largely absent from the campaign trail. The justices are set to begin their new term on Monday, with cases on affirmative action, same-sex marriage, and the federal government's terrorist surveillance program potentially stirring political debate.\n\nThe Supreme Court's docket could once again resonate in the presidential race, following the historic 5-4 decision last term upholding the core of President Barack Obama's signature health law. The case on the University of Texas' affirmative action program, scheduled for argument on October 10, could rekindle an issue that has been off the national political radar for over a decade. The first presidential debate, focusing on domestic issues, is set for exactly one week before this case. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 11.\n\nRichard Taylor, a business diversity advocate and former Massachusetts transportation secretary under Mitt Romney, commented, \"I've got to believe at this point in the campaign neither the president or Governor Romney is going to want to give a quote on any of this.\" He added, \"If I was preparing either candidate for the debate, this would be on the checklist, but I don't think either campaign will be anxious to talk about it.\"\n\nIn court briefs, the Obama administration has supported the University of Texas' right to run its affirmative action program, which is being challenged by Abigail Fisher, a white undergraduate applicant who was denied admission. However, Obama aides have a history of being cautious about engaging in debates over race, particularly those related to education-related affirmative action.\n\nA federal government policy statement on the use of race in education was delayed for three years due to protracted interagency debates before its release last December. John Brittain, a civil rights activist and law professor at the University of the District of Columbia, noted, \"The administration had a paralysis of analysis... Overall, the Obama administration just has a reluctance to take on race and equality, and when they do so everything is so carefully sanitized and scrubbed to make sure it's the least offensive thing possible.\"\n\nAs the presidential race continues, the Supreme Court's upcoming cases could provide a new set of issues for the candidates to navigate, potentially adding another layer of complexity to an already heated election season.",
    " Title: President Obama Signs Bipartisan Budget Bill, Averts Government Shutdown and Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Barack Obama signed a bipartisan budget bill on Thursday, during his vacation in Hawaii. The spending measure, which was approved by the Senate last week and the House earlier, marks an end to the cycle of fiscal brinkmanship for the next two years, preventing another government shutdown.\n\nThe bill, which reduces across-the-board cuts already scheduled to take effect, restores about $63 billion over two years. It also includes a projected $85 billion in other savings. The bill appropriates funds for Department of Defense programs and related spending at other agencies. The act sets out a Pentagon base budget of $526.8 billion in the 2014 fiscal year.\n\nHowever, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2014 does not go as far as the president wants in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. As in past years, Obama attached a signing statement expressing his disapproval of \"unwarranted and burdensome restrictions\" on transferring detainees out of the prison.\n\nAlthough the law eases those restrictions a bit, making it easier to transfer detainees to foreign countries, Congress still prohibits the White House from moving detainees to U.S. soil, making it nearly impossible to close the prison. Obama has stated that the restrictions are \"unwise\" and that the executive branch must have the authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees.\n\nThe bill signing comes at the end of a tumultuous year that saw a partial government shutdown, a near-default by the Treasury, a calamitous health care rollout, and near-perpetual congressional gridlock.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Wrap Up Final Day of Campaigning in Battle of the Bands\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final 24-hour stretch of the 2012 Presidential Campaign, both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney embarked on a whirlwind tour of six states on Monday, each employing musical icons to rally support. The candidates' final full day of campaigning transformed into a musical spectacle, with each candidate accompanied by a star-studded lineup.\n\nPresident Obama, accompanied by Bruce Springsteen, embarked on a trip through Wisconsin, Ohio, and Iowa, while Mitt Romney, with The Marshall Tucker Band in Columbus, Ohio, and Kid Rock in Manchester, N.H., closed out his campaign trail.\n\nIn Madison, Wis., President Obama, with a hoarse voice, urged voters to help him \"finish what we started.\" He accused Romney of trying to \"repackage the same old, bad ideas\" as change and held up the Clinton administration's economic record of the '90s as evidence that Democratic ideas \"work.\"\n\n\"We have come too far to turn back now,\" the president said.\n\nRomney, in Florida, continued to hammer his message that Obama is holding back the economic recovery, and that clearing him out of office will unleash the power of America's supposedly regulation-burdened entrepreneurs.\n\n\"The door to a brighter future is open, it's waiting for us,\" Romney said. \"Tomorrow, we begin a new tomorrow.\"\n\nRomney claimed his campaign has \"gathered strength\" in recent weeks and become a \"movement.\" Indeed, Romney gained considerable traction in the polls after his first debate against Obama. However, the race is still effectively tied at the national level, and in the battleground states where the election will be decided, voters are similarly split.\n\nBy most estimates, Obama comes into Election Day with a slight advantage in the electoral vote count. The RealClearPolitics electoral map shows the states likely to vote for Obama are worth 201 electoral votes, while those likely to vote for Romney are worth 191. It takes 270 to win.\n\nThe toss-ups include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nOhio, with its 18 electoral votes, is considered crucial for either candidate. Most polls show Obama with a slight lead, but Romney is expected to campaign in Ohio on Election Day. Romney has been making a late play for Democrat-leaning Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes, a win there for Romney could provide him a firewall in case he loses Ohio.\n\nA poll released Sunday in The Pittsburgh Tribune showed the race in the Keystone State locked up at 47 percent in the final week.\n\nBoth candidates pledged to govern in a bipartisan fashion for the next four years as they both tried to reach independent and undecided voters.\n\n\"I want all parties to work together,\" the president said at a rally in Hollywood, Fla. \"We're not Democrats and Republicans first. We're Americans first.... As long as I'm president, I will work with anybody, of any party, to move this country forward.\"",
    " Title: Trump Appeals to Supreme Court in Bid to Block Release of Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Donald Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking to reverse a court order mandating the release of his tax returns. This move marks a dramatic escalation in Trump's efforts to maintain the privacy of his financial records.\n\nThe appeal comes after a federal appeals court in New York last week authorized Manhattan prosecutors to enforce a subpoena against Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his personal and corporate financial records from 2011 to 2018.\n\nTrump's legal team, led by Jay Sekulow, argued in their petition to the Supreme Court that the records request was politically motivated and infringed upon the immunity the Constitution grants to the president. The petition states, \"That the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable. Indeed, politically motivated subpoenas like this one are a perfect illustration of why a sitting president should be categorically immune from state criminal process.\"\n\nJay Sekulow, Trump's lawyer, stated, \"We have filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Second Circuit decision regarding a subpoena issued by the New York County District Attorney. The Second Circuit decision is wrong and should be reversed. In our petition, we assert that the subpoena violates the U.S. Constitution and therefore is unenforceable.\"\n\nA three-judge panel of the Second Circuit last week allowed Manhattan prosecutors to obtain Trump's financial records as part of a grand jury investigation. Cyrus Vance Jr., the Democratic district attorney for New York County, agreed not to enforce the subpoena due to Trump's lawyers' promise to quickly appeal to the Supreme Court. Vance's office is investigating payments allegedly made to silence two women who claim they had affairs with Trump.\n\nTrump's lawyers have maintained that the president has blanket immunity from criminal prosecution. During a notable oral argument before the circuit court last month, Trump's personal lawyer, William Consovoy, argued that the president could not be prosecuted even if he committed a crime in broad daylight.\n\nThe three judges on the circuit court panel, all Democratic appointees, did not rule on Trump's broad claims of immunity and whether the president could be prosecuted. However, they determined that any immunity Trump had did not cover a subpoena to his accounting firm.\n\nTrump has faced criticism for not adhering to a decades-long tradition of presidents voluntarily releasing their tax returns. This Supreme Court petition represents Trump's final attempt to keep the documents confidential.\n\nThis is one of two legal battles over subpoenas for Trump's financial records expected to reach the Supreme Court. In a separate case in Washington, D.C., a federal appeals court on Wednesday cleared the way for House Democrats on the Oversight Committee to pursue Trump's financial records from Mazars. Trump's lawyers have indicated they will also appeal that decision to the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: SpaceX's Historic Launch: A New Era in Commercial Space Travel and a Leap Forward for NASA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant milestone for commercial space travel and a return to American space launches from U.S. soil, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken blasted off on Saturday, marking the first time a private company has launched humans into orbit. The launch, which took place at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used for the Apollo moon missions, signifies a new era in space exploration and a significant step forward for NASA's commercial crew program.\n\nThe two astronauts, who are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, rode aboard a sleek, white-and-black Dragon capsule atop the Falcon 9 rocket. The mission unfolded amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest in the U.S., with many hoping the flight would serve as a morale-booster.\n\n\"Let's light this candle,\" Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight in 1961. With this launch, SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, becomes the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat previously achieved only by three governments: the U.S., Russia, and China.\n\nThe launch also ends a nine-year drought for NASA, marking the longest such hiatus in its history. Since retiring the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nThe mission is the latest milestone for NASA's commercial crew program, a partnership between the agency, SpaceX, and Boeing. The first attempt on Wednesday was scrubbed at the last minute due to bad weather. Space exploration and adjacent businesses, such as space tourism and long-haul travel on Earth, are expected to grow into a more than $800 billion industry in the next decade.\n\nNASA has also partnered with private companies for its Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024. Blue Origin's team, which includes defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, is one of the selected partners.\n\nAnalysts at UBS expect the \"space economy\" to grow to around $244 billion this year and $805 billion by 2030. \"Space tourism likely to be a common reality in the not-too-distant future,\" they said, and long-haul travel \"an even bigger opportunity.\"\n\nNASA ended its space shuttle program in 2011, when the Atlantis space shuttle set off for its last mission to the International Space Station, with Doug Hurley as one of four astronauts. Hurley and Bob Behnken are the two NASA astronauts headed into orbit on Saturday. NASA has tasked Boeing and SpaceX with developing and operating a new generation of spacecraft and launch systems capable of carrying crews to low-earth orbit and the International Space Station.

    " Title: Mitt Romney's Mormon Faith Remains a Political Mystery Amidst 2012 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election, is seeking to present himself as the savior of the economy and the nation, the American hero riding in on the proverbial white horse. However, his Mormon faith, a significant aspect of his personal life, remains a mystery and a potential obstacle for many voters.\n\nThe White House race has seen a resurgence of religious discussions, with recent revelations about proposed ads linking President Barack Obama to his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. In response, some Democrats argue that discussing Romney's religion is now fair game as well.\n\nThe White Horse prophecy, attributed to Mormon founder Joseph Smith, has been discredited by the Church for nearly a century, but it continues to be a topic of interest and debate among Mormons. The prophecy suggests that Mormons, flush with wealth, will rise and lead America back to greatness when the banks fail and the Constitution is nearing collapse.\n\nWhile the prophecy is controversial, it reflects important themes of mainstream Mormonism, such as the belief that the Founding Fathers were divinely inspired and that Mormons have a special role in preserving the Constitution and the nation.\n\nRomney, for the most part, has avoided discussing his religious beliefs in detail, referring to \"people of different faiths, like yours and mine\" in his commencement address to the evangelical Liberty University. This leaves journalists and observers searching for clues about Romney's religious views.\n\nThe attention given to Mormon views of the Constitution, which has percolated up from blogs to the New York Times, provides a window into how this can play out on the campaign trail. The prophecy's most famous line, \"the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed...it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse,\" is well-known among many church members and continues to be a topic of conversation.\n\nIf Romney believes in the prophecy, he would be in line with most other members of his faith. He has mentioned the divine influence on the Constitution several times on the campaign trail, such as when a woman accused Obama of treason and asked whether Romney would \"restore our Constitution,\" Romney responded, \"I happen to believe that the Constitution was not just brilliant, but probably inspired.\"\n\nThe prophecy is one of the most debated aspects of Romney's religion, even among believers. Like jazz and baseball, Mormonism has a distinctively American heartbeat. According to LDS beliefs, the Garden of Eden was located in Missouri, and Joseph Smith found the Book of Mormon in upstate New York. It is up to the Mormons to save America when the country begins to collapse.\n\nThe prophecy warns of trouble in the Middle East and anti-Mormon sentiment pervading the government. \"You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed...it will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber,\" the prophecy states. However, \"it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse,\" who will \"stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God.\"\n\nThe Black Horse, commonly interpreted as American blacks, will side with England and France, but eventually submit to the White Horse as the religion fulfills its world-conquering destiny in an Armageddon-style war with the Russians, while keeping an eye on the looming threat of China.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Victory for Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama Senate Race Reflects Trends from Recent Democratic Wins\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, Democrat Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a statewide office in Alabama since 2008, defeating Republican Roy Moore in a special election on Tuesday to fill the Senate seat previously held by Jeff Sessions. Jones secured 49.9% of the votes, while Moore garnered 48.4%. This marks the first time a Democrat has won a Senate race in Alabama since 1992, a period during which Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, who was still a Democrat at the time, switched parties in 1994.\n\nThe Alabama Senate special election exhibited several unique factors, including a GOP nominee accused of pursuing relationships with teenage girls, a controversial figure in the state, a mid-December vote, and a Democratic nominee who significantly outspent his Republican rival during the general election phase of the campaign.\n\nHowever, the Alabama results also reflect trends observed in prior elections, such as the race for governor in Virginia this year, that could indicate favorable conditions for Democrats in the upcoming 2018 mid-term elections, where control of the House of Representatives and now the Senate will be at stake.\n\nThese emerging Democratic advantages include energized support from non-white voters, increased party turnout in metropolitan areas, and stronger performance in well-educated suburban communities. Simultaneously, Republican turnout in white rural counties, which provided a significant boost to Donald Trump in 2016, has been lower in two key contests, the Virginia gubernatorial election and Tuesday's Alabama Senate race.\n\nJames A. Barnes, a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics, provided insights into the Alabama Senate race and its implications for the 2018 mid-term elections.",
    " Title: WIRED Concedes Right-Wing Criticism of WHO Contains Grain of Truth\n\nA left-leaning technology magazine, WIRED, has admitted that a \"right-wing stunt\" to blame the World Health Organization (WHO) for the Covid-19 pandemic may contain a valid point. The tweet from WIRED's account suggested that there is at least some reason to suspect that the WHO knowingly and consequentially misled the public.\n\nThe tweet linked to an article written by a WIRED \"Ideas Contributor\" who, surprisingly, found himself in agreement with conservative critics of the WHO. The article cited a call from Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) to investigate the WHO to determine if the United States should freeze their significant, taxpayer-funded contribution.\n\nThe WIRED contributor, who identifies as a global governance advocate, expressed surprise at finding himself in alignment with conservatives. He acknowledged that the \"right-wing move\" to scrutinize international institutions like the WHO is a familiar tactic, often used to justify cutting their funding. However, in this case, the contributor admitted that he is not in favor of cutting WHO funding and is not convinced that the WHO is guilty as charged.\n\nThe article points out the WHO's controversial tweet from January that claimed there was no evidence from China suggesting human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, despite ample evidence to the contrary. The WIRED contributor suggests that the \"right-wing stunt\" may have been an assessment of evidence and consequences that led to a lack of faith in the WHO.\n\nAs the global Wuhan coronavirus pandemic continues, people of all political stripes have shifted significant blame to the Chinese Communist Party for concealing the nature of the disease. Blame has then naturally trickled down to the WHO, who seemed to have, for whatever reason, a vested interest in protecting the CCP.\n\nWhile the media has consistently criticized President Trump for his response to the outbreak of the Wuhan Coronavirus in the U.S., particularly in the early days, it is difficult for even his most unflappable foes to ignore the errors and misguidance of the WHO.\n\nThe WIRED article concludes by acknowledging that the \"right-wing stunt\" may have been an accurate assessment of the WHO's actions, despite the political connotations often associated with such criticism. The article serves as a reminder that even in a highly politicized environment, it is important to consider all evidence and perspectives when evaluating the actions of international organizations like the WHO.",
    " Title: Understanding Trump's Communication Style: Serious, Not Literal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, a new approach to understanding Donald Trump's communication style has emerged. Journalist Salena Zito, in an article for The Atlantic, suggests that the media should take Trump seriously, but not literally. This distinction, according to Zito, is crucial in deciphering Trump's unique rhetoric.\n\nThe idea is that the media often takes Trump's more outlandish statements literally but not seriously, while his supporters do the opposite. Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and major backer, Peter Thiel, have both made similar points, stating that the media takes Trump literally but not seriously, while his supporters take him seriously but not literally.\n\nLast week, Trump himself admitted that his statement in April, \"We're not going to let Carrier leave,\" was not meant literally. He explained, \"I said, 'Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in.\"\n\nThis distinction is a useful tool for interpreting Trump's rhetoric, but it raises questions about how to handle his more controversial statements, such as his claim that millions of people voted illegally. Should the media take this indefensible claim \"seriously but not literally\"? Or should they assume that some number of people voted illegally, but not millions?\n\nThe distinction is also compared to Vice President Joe Biden's non-literal approach, which is safe due to his established role in the Washington establishment and the limited harm he can cause. Trump, however, is different. As an outsider and a self-proclaimed \"disrupter,\" Trump's words take on greater importance due to his lack of a track record in public office.\n\nThis serious-not-literal approach is a valuable analytical tool for understanding Trump's communication with his supporters. However, it is questionable as a prescription for how to treat a president or president-elect of the United States. Words matter, and credibility, a finite resource, can be easily depleted when one thinks they will never be held accountable for what they say.\n\nJonah Goldberg, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior editor of National Review, suggests that Trump would be well-advised to take his own words seriously, if not literally. What a president says matters, and credibility is a crucial asset in maintaining relationships with citizens, allies, enemies, and markets.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Dick Cheney Criticizes Senate Report on CIA Interrogation Techniques\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated interview on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" on Wednesday, former Vice President Dick Cheney criticized a recently released Senate report on CIA interrogation practices, labeling it as \"full of crap\" and a \"terrible piece of work\" that is \"deeply flawed.\"\n\nCheney, who served under President George W. Bush, defended the controversial interrogation techniques used on militants, including waterboarding and rectal hydration, stating that some of these methods had been previously tested and had produced results.\n\nDespite not having read the entire 500-page report summary, Cheney strongly defended the tactics and questioned, \"What are you prepared to do to get the truth against future attacks against the United States?\"\n\nCheney also refuted claims that President Bush was kept in the dark about the interrogations, asserting, \"I think he knew everything he wanted to know and needed to know.\"\n\nThe Democrat-led Senate intelligence committee released the report on Tuesday, which was met with a scathing critique of CIA interrogation practices. The report claimed the techniques used were \"brutal and far worse\" than the CIA represented to lawmakers. Furthermore, the report claimed the tactics were not effective and the CIA provided \"inaccurate\" information about it to Congress and the White House.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the head of the intelligence panel who ordered the release of the report, alleged on the Senate floor on Tuesday that the CIA techniques in some cases amounted to \"torture.\"\n\n\"History will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say 'never again,'\" Feinstein said on the floor. \"There may never be the right time to release this report. But this report is too important to shelve indefinitely.\"\n\nThe White House and President Obama backed the decision to release the report, despite warnings from lawmakers and some inside the administration that it could lead to a backlash against Americans. The Obama administration reportedly put more than 6,000 Marines overseas on high alert in response to the report's release.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Role in Trump Legal Challenges May Be Tested as Focus Shifts to Personal Matters\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's relationship with the U.S. Supreme Court could be tested by a series of legal disputes targeting him personally, including his taxes, businesses, and 2016 election campaign, which may ultimately be decided by the justices.\n\nTrump has viewed the court, whose 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices he appointed, as friendly territory, unlike certain lower courts and individual judges he has publicly criticized after ending up on the wrong side of rulings. The Supreme Court has already given the Republican president victories on some pivotal policies, including upholding his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nHowever, as the focus of some of the major legal challenges shifts from his policies to Trump himself, there could be disappointments in store for him, according to some legal experts, particularly if the Supreme Court stoutly defends the ability of Congress to pursue investigations of the president.\n\nConservative legal scholar J.W. Verret, an expert in corporate and securities law at George Mason University in Virginia, said, \"The conservative justices won't feel any loyalty to Trump, but will instead support strong separation of powers as delineated in the U.S. Constitution, assigning specific roles to the government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\"\n\n\"That means upholding lower court decisions finding proper legislative purpose in recent inquiries regarding tax and financial fraud subpoenas,\" Verret added.\n\nTrump, who is seeking re-election in 2020, and his administration have defied a series of subpoenas coming from the Democratic-led House of Representatives. The subpoenas have sought testimony from current and former administration officials as well as documents covering matters such as his tax returns, banking records, family business interests, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump's actions to impede the inquiry.\n\nThe president and his lawyers have defiantly challenged the oversight authority of Congress, a stance that Democrats have framed as an attack on the separation of powers. Trump has sued to try to block enforcement of certain subpoenas, losing thus far in lower courts. And House Democrats, who are divided on whether to launch the impeachment process set out in the Constitution to remove a president from office, appear poised to press the matter by bringing their own court actions to try to enforce their subpoenas.\n\nOther lawsuits, including one brought by congressional Democrats, also accuse Trump of violating an anti-corruption provision in the Constitution, called the emoluments clause, by continuing to accept payments from foreign governments through his businesses, including a downtown Washington hotel.\n\nSome of Trump's losses in lower courts are already on appeal, and potentially could come before the Supreme Court with decisions issued during the heat of the election season.\n\nStuart Gerson, a Republican former Justice Department official and former acting U.S. attorney general, said the Supreme Court might be skeptical if the aim of subpoenas by Democratic lawmakers is merely to \"educate the American people and build up a tide for impeachment that doesn't exist now.\"\n\n\"There's no black and white,\" Gerson added. \"It will be 'win some, lose some,' and the Supreme Court, I think, given its precedent, will define a middle ground.\"\n\nWilliam Consovoy, Trump's lead lawyer on cases involving his business dealings, did not respond to a request seeking comment. The White House declined to comment for this story.\n\nTrump has professed his faith in the Supreme Court and the importance of a president's role in making lifetime appointments to the top U.S. judicial body. Trump has said his promise to name conservative justices was a \"main reason\" why he was elected in 2016. His two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, have deepened the conservative hold on the court.\n\nAside from the travel ban, Trump's policy victories at the Supreme Court have included implementation of his ban on most transgender people in the U.S. military and blocking Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from being deposed in a lawsuit over the contentious plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. His administration has sought to bypass lower courts by rushing certain appeals of adverse rulings to the high court.\n\nTrump's lawyers have justified stonewalling subpoenas by arguing that the Democratic demands exceed congressional authority, are overly broad, or improperly invade Trump's private affairs. Federal judges have rejected those arguments, citing Supreme Court precedent that Congress has broad authority to investigate corruption or improper conduct in the workings of government.\n\nIf federal appeals courts uphold judges' rulings that side with Congress, Verret predicted the Supreme Court would deliver \"either a 9-0 outcome in support\" of the lower courts or would simply refuse to hear the administration's appeal, leaving the lower court rulings intact.\n\n\"This goes to precedent involving core congressional oversight power,\" Verret added.\n\nSo long as they do not impede a president's duties, demands from Congress for documents that could cause embarrassment or political problems do not provide legal grounds to refuse to comply, added William Ross, who teaches constitutional law at Samford University in Alabama.\n\nThe Supreme Court's first taste of the fight between Trump and congressional Democratic could come in two fast-moving cases. Trump is trying to block subpoenas for financial records that were issued to his accounting firm, Mazars LLP, and two banks with which he has done business: Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. Judges in Washington and New York, respectively, ruled that the subpoenas could be enforced. Trump has appealed in both cases and could seek to bring them to the Supreme Court if he keeps losing in lower courts.\n\nThe emoluments issue also could be heading toward the justices. The Supreme Court will likely have the final say concerning potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump's Washington hotel and other business interests \"because courts have never had to deal with this in 200-plus years,\" said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor at Stetson University College of Law in Florida.",
    " Title: Paris: Deadliest Terror Attack in Decades Hits Satirical Newspaper Charlie Hebdo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, resulting in the death of 12 individuals, including the editor and a cartoonist. This marks France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande, in a swift response, labeled the attack on the Charlie Hebdo weekly, known for its controversial caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, as a \"terrorist attack without a doubt.\" He also mentioned that several other potential attacks have been thwarted in France \"in recent weeks.\"\n\nAs the manhunt for the perpetrators continues, France has raised its security alert to the highest level and reinforced protective measures at houses of worship, stores, media offices, and transportation. Top government officials are holding an emergency meeting, and Hollande is scheduled to deliver a nationally televised address in the evening. Schools across the French capital have been closed.\n\nWorld leaders, including President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have condemned the attack. However, supporters of the militant Islamic State group have celebrated the slayings as well-deserved revenge against France.\n\nThe Islamic State group has repeatedly threatened to attack France. Just minutes before the attack, Charlie Hebdo had tweeted a satirical cartoon of the extremist group's leader giving New Year's wishes. Another cartoon, released in this week's issue and entitled \"Still No Attacks in France,\" had a caricature of an extremist fighter saying \"Just wait \u2014 we have until the end of January to present our New Year's wishes.\"\n\nThe 12 fatalities include two men who went by the pen names Charb \u2014 the editor and a cartoonist \u2014 and the cartoonist Cabu, as confirmed by Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman of the Paris prosecutor's office. Two police officers were also among the dead, including one assigned as Charb's bodyguard after prior death threats against him, a police official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe attack occurred around noon, with multiple masked men armed with automatic weapons attacking the newspaper's office in central Paris. Nearby worker Benoit Bringer told the iTele network, and Christophe DeLoire of Reporters Without Borders described the gunmen going to the second floor and indiscriminately firing in the newsroom.\n\n\"This is the darkest day of the history of the French press,\" DeLoire said.\n\nVideo images on the website of public broadcaster France Televisions showed two gunmen in black at a crossroads who appeared to fire down one of the streets. A cry of \"Allahu akbar!\" \u2014 Arabic for \"God is great\" \u2014 could be heard among the gunshots.\n\nThe attackers left in a waiting car and later switched to another vehicle that had been stolen, according to Luc Poignant of the SBP police union.\n\nUS officials have been in close contact with the French since the attack, with Obama's top spokesman stating, \"We know they are not going to be cowed by this terrible act.\"\n\nOn social media, supporters of militant Islamic groups praised the move. One Twitter user who identified themselves as a Tunisian loyalist of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group called the attack well-deserved revenge against France.\n\nElsewhere on the Internet, the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie was trending as people expressed support for the weekly and for journalistic freedom.\n\nCharlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other controversial sketches. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the prophet on its cover. Nearly a year later, the publication again published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the Muslim world.\n\nWednesday's attack comes on the same day as the release of a book by a celebrated French novelist depicting France's election of its first Muslim president. Hollande was due to meet with the country's top religious officials later in the day.",
    " Title: Senate Expresses Concern Over Trump's Tariff Strategy, Votes to Involve Congress in Section 232 Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a symbolic move, the Senate on Wednesday voted to instruct lawmakers working on a government funding bill to include language that would provide a role for Congress in tariffs implemented for national security reasons, known as Section 232 of the trade laws. The nonbinding vote, which saw 88 senators in favor and 11 against, underscores the depth of concern on Capitol Hill regarding President Trump's tariff strategy.\n\nThe vote is nonbinding, meaning lawmakers are not obligated to add trade language into the funding bill. However, the wide margin of support, with more senators voting in favor than the number needed to override a veto, indicates the level of anxiety among lawmakers about the tariffs.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) commented on the vote, stating, \"I think it's significant that, as many of us have discussed with the president and his Cabinet, there's some anxiety about... tariffs.\" He added, \"I think it's just a way to make that point.\"\n\nThe president has used Section 232 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including imposing financial penalties on key trading allies such as the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. However, Republicans have been wary of using legislation to push back against Trump before the midterm elections.\n\nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) attempted to attach legislation requiring congressional approval for tariffs applied for national security reasons to both a defense policy bill and the farm bill, but was blocked both times. Corker stated after the vote that he would continue to push for the Senate to pass stand-alone legislation on Trump's tariff authority.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) added, \"Congress has to rein in abuse of presidential authority and restore Congress's constitutional authority in this regard.\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has also stated he will bring up tariff legislation in the committee.\n\nTrump allies have warned lawmakers against passing legislation, arguing it would undercut the president's negotiating ability. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted against the measure, criticized senators, stating, \"I just don't understand why this body continues to try to tie the hands of this president at every turn.\"\n\nSenators John Barrasso (Wyo.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Dean Heller (Nev.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), James Inhofe (Okla.), Jim Risch (Idaho), and Tim Scott (S.C.) also voted against the measure.",
    " Title: Obama's Syria Decision Weighed by Past Iraq Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's response to the escalating conflict in Syria appears to be influenced significantly by the United States' involvement in Iraq. The ghosts of the Iraq War loom large over the president and his advisers as they navigate the Syria crisis, according to former officials and analysts close to the administration.\n\nThe administration's cautious approach to the Syria crisis is a direct result of the lessons learned from the Iraq War. They are determined to avoid repeating past mistakes and are wary of moving too quickly or becoming embroiled in another Middle East conflict.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration joined Israeli and European intelligence in stating that there was some evidence that President Bashar Assad had used chemical weapons. This leaves the administration in a delicate position, as they balance their concerns against Obama's repeated vows that the use of nerve agents or poison gas by Assad's regime would be a \"red line\" and a \"game changer\" that would warrant a stronger response.\n\nGreg Craig, who served as a foreign policy adviser on Obama's 2008 campaign and as his first White House counsel, noted the impact of the Iraq history. \"He does not want to jump to conclusions or shoot from the hip,\" Craig said.\n\nThe administration's caution is rooted in the past, with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) having incorrectly concluded that Iraq had nuclear weapons in 2003, a claim that was never substantiated. In a more direct parallel to Syria, the CIA also reported that Saddam Hussein had an active chemical and biological weapons program, a claim that also proved to be inaccurate.\n\nSandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, now with the Albright-Stonebridge Group, echoed this sentiment. \"This is actually a pretty good example of the kind of situation where it pays to learn the lessons of Iraq,\" Berger said. \"My sense is that they are reluctant to get involved on the basis of evidence that is not, to use a familiar term, a'slam dunk.'\"\n\nA White House official, who briefed reporters on the Syria issue Thursday, acknowledged the impact of the Iraq War on the administration's approach. \"Given our own history with intelligence assessments, including intelligence assessments related to weapons of mass destruction, it's very important that we are able to establish this with certainty and that we are able to present information that is airtight in a public and credible fashion to underpin all of our decision-making,\" the official said.\n\nThe challenges faced by U.S. troops in Iraq are also a key factor in Obama's wariness about becoming more deeply involved in Syria by directly arming rebels or setting up a no-fly zone. After some predicted American troops would be greeted with roses, the conflict in Iraq turned out to be a quagmire that took the U.S. five years to extract itself from\u2014and played a central role in delivering Obama to the Oval Office.",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Hopefuls Adapt Stances on Common Core, Immigration, and Israel Ahead of 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has become the latest contender to adjust his political positions, following in the footsteps of Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul. The changes, according to political analysts, are an attempt to align with the conservative values that will determine the GOP primary voters.\n\nJindal, who initially supported the Common Core education curriculum in 2010, has now criticized it as an example of federal overreach. This shift in stance mirrors Rubio's reversal on his signature immigration bill and Paul's softening of his stance on phasing out foreign assistance, including aid to Israel.\n\nDarrell M. West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institute, explained, \"They are adapting to new GOP winds and trying to put themselves in the strongest possible position. This means getting tough on the Common Core, which conservatives hate. It also means becoming more negative on comprehensive immigration reform and making sure they are supportive of Israel.\"\n\nThe adjustments in policy positions are a common tactic among political candidates, particularly during the pre-primary period. Mark McKinnon, a GOP strategist, noted, \"If you're going to flip-flop in politics, best to do it early and off-Broadway.\"\n\nHistorically, candidates have been known to change their positions on significant, heartfelt issues. For instance, Mitt Romney transitioned from being pro-choice to pro-life ahead of his 2008 and 2012 bids for the GOP presidential nomination. Similarly, then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 but ran against it in the 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nIn Jindal's case, his growing discontent with the Common Core was evident as he faced pressure from conservative and tea party activists in his state. On Wednesday, Jindal filed a lawsuit accusing the Obama administration of illegally coercing states into adopting the standards, which 44 states and the District of Columbia have adopted.\n\nRubio, in a separate development, made his most definitive statement yet on immigration, essentially declaring his own legislation dead, stating that there is \"no realistic path forward on comprehensive [immigration] reform for the foreseeable future.\" Instead, he suggested a piecemeal approach to the issue, starting with stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Rand Paul has sought to reassure voters that he has never supported cutting aid to Israel, despite previous statements to the contrary.\n\nWhile political shifts can be used by opponents to attack candidates, Michael McKenna, a GOP consultant, argued, \"These shifts are part of what makes popular sovereignty so great\u2014those who want to get elected have to (ultimately) express the will of the majority of the electorate, or they don't get elected. And usually, people like to do it when not too many folks are watching the evolution. Because it can get misconstrued as being indecisive or, worse, pandering.\"",
    " Title: The Kavanaugh Hearings and the Epidemic of Bigotry: A Reflection on Uncertainty, Tribalism, and Stereotyping\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh have sparked a heated debate, not only about the credibility of the nominee but also about the state of public discourse and the role of uncertainty in our society. At the core of this controversy lies a mystery: the events that transpired at a party 36 years ago, for which there is no corroborating evidence.\n\nThe hearings have raised crucial questions about how we handle uncertainty, how we weigh conflicting testimonies, and how we measure the credibility of these testimonies in light of cognitive science's findings about human fallibility in detecting falsehoods. In the midst of this uncertainty, many have rushed to take sides, either defending or condemning Kavanaugh, often without a thorough examination of the original evidence.\n\nThe polarization of opinions has led to an upsurge in base mobilization, where persuasion is no longer a priority in public conversation. Statements are made to rally one's own side, rather than to foster understanding or promote truth. This has resulted in a spectacle of histrionics, with figures like Senator Cory Booker and Brett Kavanaugh themselves engaging in passionate displays to galvanize their respective supporters.\n\nThe hearings have also highlighted an epidemic of bigotry, as individuals are quick to apply stereotypes to people they have never met. This bigotry, reminiscent of historical cases such as the Dreyfus Affair, the Central Park Five case, and the Duke lacrosse scandal, has led to thousands of people forming opinions about Kavanaugh based on their preconceived notions of \"privileged\" individuals. Similarly, many have rallied behind Kavanaugh due to a perceived threat from the \"Left.\"\n\nIn this divisive climate, it is essential to remember the importance of intellectual humility, critical thinking, and empathy. As we navigate through uncertainty, it is crucial to approach situations with an open mind, to question our own biases, and to strive for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. Only then can we hope to move beyond the tribal warfare that has come to characterize our public discourse.",
    " Title: Ferguson Protests: Residents and Protesters Undeterred by Violence, Call for Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nAs midnight approaches in Ferguson, Missouri, tension in the city remains high, with residents and protesters braving the cold temperatures to demand justice following the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Despite the violence and looting that occurred on Monday, people continue to come out, standing up against injustice.\n\nOutside the City Hall, crowds flipped a police cruiser on its side, broke out its windows, and set it on fire. Police moved in quickly to put out the fire and used pepper gas to disperse the crowd. \"We are not your enemy,\" they chanted. \"We just want justice.\"\n\nThroughout the day, authorities scrambled resources in a bid to prevent a repeat of the violence that erupted in the wake of the grand jury's decision. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered additional National Guardsmen to the area, boosting their numbers from 700 to 2,200. \"We are bringing more resources to Ferguson and other parts of the region to prevent a repetition of the lawlessness experienced overnight,\" the governor said.\n\nEarlier in the day, volunteers helped clean up vandalized stores and eateries and board up broken windows and doors. Some residents carried guns and said volunteers were out protecting houses on the streets off South Florissant Road. Armed men carrying assault rifles paced the roof of Beauty World, a store that was badly damaged in Monday's protests.\n\nCustomers inside Marley's said they were not afraid to be out, even as the noise of police sirens and helicopters filled the air. This was, they said, their community, and no one was going to take it away from them.\n\nCNN saw two protesters arrested after they refused to get out of the street. Most others returned to the sidewalk when asked to do so by police. Throughout the day, authorities worked to maintain peace and prevent further violence.\n\nThe vast majority of protests in the weeks after Brown's death have been peaceful. And authorities hope to keep it that way. \"All agree that the violence we saw in the areas of Ferguson last night can not be repeated,\" Nixon said.\n\nSt. Louis police have identified a man who was found shot to death and set on fire. Police Chief Jon Belmar told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper that he is not discounting the possibility that the death was linked to the violence that ravaged Ferguson on Monday night. Deandre Joshua, 20, was found Monday night behind the wheel of a Pontiac in a parking lot, just down the street from Canfield Green Apartments where Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson. Joshua had been shot in the head, police said. An accelerant was used to light him on fire, but the fire went out on its own, police said. He had burns to his arm, fingers, and both legs.\n\nThe events in Ferguson have sparked protests across the country, with activists taking to the streets in several states. \"They have given us no justice! We will give them no peace,\" protesters chanted as they massed in front of the Underground Atlanta shopping district in Atlanta. In the New York area, they briefly blocked one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton spoke in front of Brown's family earlier Tuesday, saying, \"We are on the side of Michael Brown to fight for what is right. We may have lost round one, but the fight is not over.\" The vast majority of protests in the weeks after Brown's death have been peaceful, and authorities hope to keep it that way.",
    " Title: Activists Advocating for Open Borders Endorse Warren and Sanders Ahead of Super Tuesday Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIllegal alien activists, through organizations such as United We Dream Action, are endorsing Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, particularly in key Super Tuesday states with significant illegal alien and foreign-born populations.\n\nIn a historic move, United We Dream Action, an organization with illegal aliens among its members, has endorsed both Warren and Sanders, citing their support for ending all deportations of illegal aliens. The endorsement was announced via a tweet, stating, \"For the first time ever, we are endorsing in a Presidential primary! We are excited to announce that we have chosen to endorse @ewarren and @berniesanders!\"\n\nThe endorsement video emphasizes the need to close detention camps, stop deportations, and dismantle the immigration enforcement system. Both candidates support key provisions of the 'Free to move, free to stay' platform, including shutting down for-profit detention centers, reducing budgets for ICE and CBP, reviewing and potentially halting deportations within the first 100 days, issuing executive orders to protect immigrants, and supporting legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship without provisions that could harm immigrants.\n\nThe endorsement is particularly significant in California, home to the largest illegal alien and foreign-born population in the United States. By election day in November, one-in-five of all California voters will have been born outside the U.S.\n\nIn North Carolina, Sanders is receiving support from open borders lobbying organization Mijente and the Hispanic American Democrats of Mecklenburg County. Members of each group have been canvassing for Sanders, with Oliva Chapela reporting, \"You don't know how many Latinos that I have canvassed and knocked that literally when I tell them about Bernie, they are like 'Yeah, of course.' And I'm like, 'What do you mean?' And they are like, 'Yeah, Bernie's the only choice.'\"\n\nIn prior primaries, such as the Iowa Democrat Caucus, illegal aliens and noncitizens have organized for Sanders, as reported by John Binder of \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders have endorsed a platform that includes decriminalizing U.S.-Mexico border crossings, amnesty for the majority of the 11 to 22 million illegal alien population, and taxpayer-funded healthcare for all illegal aliens, noncitizens, and foreign nationals.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for \u2588\u2588\u2588.

    " Title: Biden Campaign Advisers Request Networks to Limit Rudy Giuliani's On-Air Presence Amidst Ukraine Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at curbing the spread of perceived false information and conspiracy theories, senior advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden have written to major TV news channels requesting they limit the appearance of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on their networks.\n\nThe letter, disclosed by The Daily Beast, comes from Anita Dunn, a former acting White House communications director under Barack Obama, and Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager. In the letter, they argue that Giuliani, who is deeply embroiled in the Ukraine scandal that has prompted an impeachment inquiry, is peddling false and debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump.\n\nThe authors contend that by giving Giuliani airtime, the networks are allowing him to introduce increasingly unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation. They claim that Giuliani's on-air comments are not only false but also unhinged, with some pundits questioning his mental state.\n\nGiuliani has been a frequent presence on network and cable news shows since the news broke that an anonymous whistleblower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump was trying to solicit the help of the Ukraine government in his 2020 re-election bid. Under US election law, it is illegal to seek or gain electoral benefit from any foreign entity.\n\nThough Giuliani became a figure of national unity in the wake of 9/11 as \"America's Mayor,\" he has become a symbol of the extreme partisan divide that has opened up under Trump. His comments on the Ukraine matter have grown increasingly shrill, with him calling a fellow guest on Fox News a \"moron\" and an \"idiot.\" He has also invoked wild conspiracy theories involving Hillary Clinton, the philanthropist George Soros, and other right-wing bogey figures.\n\nHowever, the most consistent theme in Giuliani's on-air comments has been his attempt to smear Biden, who for months has been a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year. On ABC's This Week on Sunday, he repeated claims that in 2016, the then vice-president pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was investigating corruption in a gas company on whose board sat Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nIn fact, the investigation into the company, Burisma, was dormant by 2016. Top officials in the Ukraine government have made clear that no evidence of corruption relating to either Biden was found.\n\nIn their letter, Dunn and Bedingfield demand that the networks no longer book Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative. They also state that Giuliani is not a public official and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation's airwaves.\n\nIf Giuliani does appear, they demand that an equivalent amount of time be given to a surrogate for the Biden campaign. In response, Giuliani dismissed the letter as an instance of \"the usual left-wing censorship.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Struggles to Produce Rulings Amidst Ideological Divide and Contentious Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Supreme Court appears to be grappling with finding common ground in a key case, with Justice Stephen Breyer suggesting that a decision might be best postponed for the time being. Breyer's remark, made during a March 28 oral argument in a case concerning the redrawing of electoral districts, highlights the difficulty the nine justices seem to be experiencing in issuing rulings at their usual pace.\n\nThe court, which is ideologically divided with five conservatives and four liberals, has issued only 18 rulings in cases already argued this term, lagging behind its normal pace. Numerous major cases remain unresolved, including one on Wisconsin electoral boundaries heard in October and a similar case heard last month involving the same practice of \"partisan gerrymandering\" in Maryland.\n\nOther significant cases include a divisive case pitting gay rights against religious liberty, involving a Christian baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, as well as cases on fees paid by non-members to unions representing public employees, the right of workers to bring class-action claims against employers, the ability of police to obtain cellphone location data, and a California law regulating Christian-based anti-abortion facilities.\n\nSupreme Court experts expect the justices to issue a larger-than-normal number of 5-4 rulings in the coming months, increasing the chances of conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sides with the court's four liberals in major cases, casting the deciding votes.\n\nThe court's slowdown in rulings may be related to the presence of Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has shown signs of being a strident conservative voice on the bench. Gorsuch has also demonstrated a willingness to question the reasoning of his colleagues, a practice that can delay rulings.\n\nThe impasse over partisan gerrymandering was first evident when the court heard arguments on Oct. 3 in a challenge by Democratic voters to Republican-drawn state legislative districts in Wisconsin. Five months later, the justices appeared no closer to resolving the matter when they heard the similar Maryland dispute involving a Democratic-drawn U.S. House of Representatives district.\n\nThe court seemed similarly divided in the worker class action case argued on Oct. 2, the first day of the term. The justices will have to decide whether workers can be forced by companies to sign agreements waiving the right to bring class-action claims against their employer.\n\nBased on the Dec. 5 oral argument, Kennedy will also be the deciding vote in the case of whether the Denver-area Christian baker can be penalized under a Colorado anti-discrimination law or whether the U.S. Constitution's promise of free speech protects him.\n\nThe nine justices have not always been at odds with each other, even on contentious matters. There was no dissent when the court in February rejected President Donald Trump's bid to immediately end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children. The court also showed no divisions when it declined to intervene in another electoral boundaries fight, this time in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe slow pace of rulings may in part be due to scheduling, said Kannon Shanmugam, another regular Supreme Court lawyer. \"The court has had hard, divisive cases earlier in the term,\" he said. \"It's not surprising it might take a while.\"",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies Remarks on Trump's Hush-Money Payment and Other Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-point clarification released on Friday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now representing President Donald Trump in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, sought to clarify his views on several controversial statements he made in recent interviews.\n\nGiuliani, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Wednesday, revealed that Trump reimbursed his personal attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nHowever, in his clarification on Friday, Giuliani did not walk back the statement that Trump reimbursed Cohen. Instead, he attempted to clarify several other potentially problematic statements.\n\n\"These are my views,\" Giuliani's statement began. \"First: There is no campaign violation. The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President's family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\"\n\nThis statement appears to be a response to Giuliani's comments on \"Fox & Friends\" early Thursday, where he suggested the payment had political implications.\n\n\"It wasn't for the campaign,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox & Friends,\" but then added, \"Imagine if that [allegation] came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton?\"\n\nGiuliani continued in his statement Friday, \"Second: My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters.\"\n\nTrump, last month, had denied having any knowledge about the payment to Daniels in the weeks leading up to Election Day. While Giuliani said this week that Trump made the reimbursement, he also said Thursday that Trump did not know all the details until about 10 days ago.\n\nGiuliani, lastly, clarified a comment he made about the firing of James Comey. Giuliani had suggested that Trump fired Comey because he \"would not, among other things, say that [Trump] wasn't a target of the [Russia] investigation.\"\n\nIn his statement, Giuliani said, \"It is undisputed that the President's dismissal of former Director Comey\u2014an inferior executive officer\u2014was clearly in his Article II power. Recent revelations about former Director Comey further confirm the wisdom of the President's decision, which was plainly in the best interests of our nation.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Trump defended Giuliani as a \"great guy\" who \"just started days ago\" and said \"he'll get his facts straight.\"\n\n\"When Rudy made the statements\u2014Rudy is great, but Rudy has just started and he wasn't familiar with everything,\" Trump said Friday in a press gaggle at Joint Base Andrews. \"He's a special guy and he understands that this is a witch hunt.\"",
    " Title: NSA's Data Storage Center: A Response to Post-9/11 Surveillance Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the National Security Agency (NSA) began amassing vast databases of telephone call metadata and email traffic from major telecommunication companies. The email data collection program was halted in 2011, but it appears that similar data may now be gathered through alternative means.\n\nAccording to recently disclosed documents, America's phone and Internet companies grew increasingly wary of NSA demands as the years passed, fearing customer backlash over the sharing of their records with the government. To address this concern, the NSA devised a solution: storing the data itself. This is believed to be the origin of the NSA's massive data storage facility under construction in Utah, leveraging the declining cost of storage and the advancement of sophisticated search software.\n\nThese colossal databases, once referred to as \"bit buckets\" in the industry, are collections of electronic data waiting to be sifted through. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained, \"They park stuff in storage in the hopes that they will eventually have time to get to it, or that they'll find something that they need to go back and look for in the masses of data. Most of it sits and is never looked at by anyone.\"\n\nAn obscure passage in one of the Snowden documents, rules for collecting Internet data that the Obama administration wrote in secret in 2009 and that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved, suggests that the government was concerned about its ability to process all the data it was collecting. The rules allowed the government to hold on to the data if it could not keep up with the processing. The rules stated that \"the communications that may be retained\" for up to five years \"include electronic communications acquired because of the limitation on the NSA's ability to filter communications.\"\n\nA private expert who occasionally advises the NSA on this technology described the situation as follows: \"This means that if you can't desalinate all the seawater at once, you get to hold on to the ocean until you figure it out.\" The NSA's data storage strategy underscores the challenges faced by intelligence agencies in the digital age, as they strive to process and analyze vast amounts of data in the pursuit of national security.",
    " Title: A Cautious Assessment of the Iran Nuclear Deal: A Step Towards Peace or a Dangerous Appeasement?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, in April 2015, has been a subject of intense debate, with critics accusing President Obama of selling out Israel and drawing comparisons to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Adolf Hitler in 1938. However, a closer examination of the agreement reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Iran has agreed to significant concessions, including the dismantling of two-thirds of its nuclear centrifuges for at least a decade, a limit on uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent for 15 years, and a reduction of its low-enriched uranium stockpile by 97 percent. The controversial Fordo enrichment plant will be converted into a research center, and the Arak heavy water reactor, capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, will be redesigned and rebuilt to prevent this.\n\nWhile Iran's history of deception and support for terror groups like Hezbollah and regimes like Syria raises concerns about its compliance, the deal includes stringent measures to ensure Iran's adherence. Regular and intrusive access for international inspectors, not just of nuclear facilities, but of their supply chains, is a key component of the agreement. Sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy will remain in place and be lifted gradually only when the U.S. and others are satisfied that their demands are being met.\n\nCritics who compare the Iran deal to the Munich Agreement of 1938, where Chamberlain and France's \u00c9douard Daladier appeased Hitler, are drawing an inaccurate parallel. The Iran deal is not a call for total disarmament from Iran, nor does it allow for unmonitored access to Iranian armament factories. The deal is a step-by-step process of gradualism, with each side cautiously taking interim steps and searching for common ground.\n\nPresident Obama's critics have also accused him of selling out Israel, but this is far from the truth. Obama has increased funding for Israel's missile defense system, Iron Dome, and provided Israel with bunker buster bombs, a request rejected by the Bush administration. Ehud Barak, Netanyahu's former defense minister and a former prime minister himself, has praised Obama's administration for its efforts in securing Israel's security.\n\nWhile the deal is not perfect, and given Iran's history of deception, it is not a guarantee of \"peace in our time.\" However, the deal does provide a window of opportunity for increased scrutiny and a chance to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. As President Obama stated in the Rose Garden, \"If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it...with this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the Iran nuclear deal is a complex and nuanced agreement that requires vigilant monitoring and a cautious approach. While it is not a guarantee of peace, it does provide a chance to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and to potentially open the door for future diplomatic engagement. The deal is not a betrayal of Israel, but rather a step towards a more secure and stable Middle East.",
    " Title: Media Criticism of President Trump's Helsinki Statement Remains Intense, but is the Stain Indelible?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump's controversial press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the media's response has been unrelenting, with many outlets criticizing the President's statements and his subsequent attempts to clarify them.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is President Trump's assertion that he accepts the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. However, his explanation that he misspoke one word, that he meant to say \"would not\" instead of \"would,\" has been met with skepticism.\n\nCNN's Erin Burnett, for example, described Trump's explanation as a \"dog ate my homework\" alibi, while The Washington Post observed that Trump's delivery of his statement of retreat was classic Trump, sending mixed signals to both those who insist on traditional American values and those who support his unconventional approach.\n\nAnother point of contention arose when President Trump was asked by ABC reporter Cecilia Vega whether he believes Russia is still meddling in American politics. Trump's terse response of \"no\" was initially interpreted as a denial of Russia's current capabilities, but White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later clarified that Trump was simply saying \"no\" to taking questions, not addressing Moscow's current activities.\n\nThe New York Times posed the question of whether this episode marks a turning point in Trump's presidency or simply another in a series of controversial moments. The paper noted that the use of the term \"treason\" to describe Trump's actions is unprecedented in modern American politics, suggesting the deep divide and tension in the nation's current political climate.\n\nHowever, some commentators have accused Trump of being a traitor, including New York Times columnist Charles Blow, who made the accusation before Trump's meeting with Putin. This charge, the Times noted, is explosive and reveals the deep-seated animosity some journalists feel towards Trump.\n\nAs the dust settles, it remains to be seen whether this episode will have a lasting impact on Trump's presidency or if it will fade into the next controversy. One thing is certain, though: the media's response to President Trump's statements and actions will continue to be a topic of discussion and debate.",
    " Title: Scott Walker's Ambiguous Stance on Birthright Citizenship Sparks Confusion Among Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing presidential race, the topic du jour has been the potential ending of birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. This is a position that Donald Trump has advocated for, either through constitutional amendment or aggressive court challenges.\n\nThe question of Scott Walker's stance on this issue has been a subject of debate in recent days. While some media outlets interpreted his comments in an interview with NBC's Kasie Hunt as supporting the end of birthright citizenship, others view his response as a dodge.\n\nDuring the interview, when asked directly about his position, Walker said, \"Well, like I said, Harry Reid said it\u2019s not right for this country \u2014 I think that\u2019s something we should, yeah, absolutely, going forward \u2014 HUNT: We should end birthright citizenship? WALKER: Yeah, to me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country.\"\n\nHowever, his campaign later clarified Walker's response, stating, \"We have to enforce the laws, keep people from coming here, enforce E-Verify to stop the jobs magnet, and by addressing the root problems we will end the birthright citizenship problem.\"\n\nWhen asked again about his position by CNBC's John Harwood, Walker stated, \"I'm not taking a position on it one way or the other.\" He added that only after securing America's borders is it appropriate to address the issue of birthright citizenship.\n\nThis ambiguity in Walker's stance has raised eyebrows, especially considering his campaign's recent efforts to project a more assertive and Trumpian image. The New York Times reported that Walker acknowledged on a private conference call with donors that voters had found him passionless. He announced a reset of his campaign, according to a participant in the call, in which he would take on the Republican establishment to show that, like Donald J. Trump, he, too, strongly opposed the status quo.\n\nHowever, the initial days of this \"reset\" have been marked by ambiguity rather than assertiveness, with Walker refusing to take a clear position on key issues. This has left many voters and media outlets questioning his commitment to the conservative cause and his readiness for the presidency.",
    " Title: \"The Case for Abolishing the TSA: An Analysis of Airport Security and Bureaucratic Inefficiency\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has concluded a month-long contest aimed at streamlining airport security procedures. The TSA plans to award $15,000 in prize money to the applicants with the most innovative ideas. However, one research fellow at the Independent Institute suggests a more radical solution: disbanding the TSA and liberalizing security measures.\n\nAir travel, despite the stringent security measures implemented post-2001, remains incredibly safe. A report from the RAND Corporation reveals that more than 6 billion enplanements occurred between 2001 and 2011. During this period, incidents related to mechanical failures on aircraft resulted in more fatalities than security-related scenarios. In fact, when security-related incidents did occur, perpetrators were often apprehended by passengers, not by airport security.\n\nIf security is indeed necessary, one might question the TSA's effectiveness compared to alternative methods. An internal TSA report in 2011 found that the agency was largely ineffective in detecting explosives. Agents at two of the nation's busiest airports failed to detect fake bombs 60% or 75% of the time. This performance pales in comparison to private airport security, which, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office, missed fake explosives only 40% of the time, a figure from 1990 when security technology was less advanced.\n\nThe TSA's poor performance can be attributed to its bureaucratic structure. Unlike for-profit firms, the TSA does not face the right incentives. In a market setting, private firms contend with profit and loss. Earning a profit signals that a firm is providing a valuable service to the public and should continue its activities. A loss conveys the opposite. This profit-and-loss mechanism gives private firms incentives to please their customers and invent new and better ways to provide their services.\n\nA bureaucratic organization such as the TSA, however, does not face such feedback. Instead, a bureaucracy looks to increase its share of government funds. It does so in two ways. First, it tries to signal to the larger government that its work fulfills major government objectives and should be expanded. TSA officials do this by claiming their agency prevents acts of terrorism. Second, a bureaucracy expands by exhausting its budget and demonstrating that it can not accomplish its goals with the resources given. In the context of the TSA, this implies the organization has an incentive to get worse, not better, by continuously expanding its budget and security procedures.\n\nThe TSA's recent contest may indicate that the organization is aware of its less-than-popular status among travelers, but we shouldn't expect it to drastically improve the flying experience. The contest won't change the underlying incentives it faces. The TSA, a government-run bureaucracy, lacks the incentives to adapt, innovate, and cut costs. If we are truly seeking to increase airport security and reduce air-travel time, we should abolish it.\n\nAbigail R. Hall, a research fellow at the Independent Institute, a nonpartisan research and educational organization based in Oakland, Calif., presents this perspective. Her argument challenges the status quo and invites a reevaluation of the role and effectiveness of the TSA in ensuring airport security.",
    " Title: Obama's Visit to Hiroshima: A Symbol of War and Nuclear Weapons, but Also of Diplomatic Complexities\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama prepares to leave office, he has chosen Hiroshima, the city devastated by an atomic bomb in 1945, as his final foreign destination. This decision, reminiscent of his 2009 pledge to rid the world of nuclear weapons, has stirred controversy and raised questions about the potential implications of his visit.\n\nThe president's trip, according to the administration, is intended to focus on the future. However, the symbolism of the visit is fraught with potential for misinterpretation. In describing the visit, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes emphasized the loss of innocent lives, not only from the \"extraordinary loss of life of innocent Japanese civilians\" at Hiroshima but also the overall \"toll that war takes on innocent life.\" Rhodes described Hiroshima and Nagasaki as symbols of \"the toll of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nHowever, the narrative presented by Rhodes seems to omit historical context. The 2,403 innocents killed at Pearl Harbor, the millions of American, Allied, and Japanese casualties spared by the rapid culmination of the war in August 1945, are conspicuously absent from this narrative.\n\nMoreover, Obama's presence could potentially undermine burgeoning efforts at Japanese-South Korean reconciliation. The visit may be perceived as affirming the Korean view that Washington has \"chosen\" Tokyo over Seoul and now accepts revisionist history depicting Japan as the victim.\n\nHiroshima serves as a reminder not just of the tragedy of a weapon of war, but of aggressive regimes and the wars they impose. The Axis Powers may be gone, but modern-day despots remain. More important than an end to nuclear weapons, President Obama should instead call upon all nations to band together against totalitarian regimes that still seek to impose their will over weaker neighbors. The visit to Hiroshima, while symbolizing the devastating impact of nuclear weapons, also presents an opportunity for Obama to address the broader issue of global peace and stability.",
    " Title: Congress Overturns Obama-Era Auto Lending Rule, Allowing Dealers to Set Interest Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move that has been met with controversy, President Donald Trump has signed a bill that repeals a rule aimed at preventing auto dealers from marking up interest rates on auto loans, a practice that critics argue is racially discriminatory. The rule, which was initially implemented in 2013, was struck down under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a law that allows Congress to overrule agency regulations.\n\nThe auto lending rule was a response to reports indicating that black and Hispanic car buyers were disproportionately charged higher interest rates on their loans compared to white car buyers. This practice, known as \"indirect\" lending, involves third-party financial institutions that return a portion of the higher interest rate back to the car dealership.\n\nSupporters of the lending system argue that it provides car dealers and lenders with the flexibility to offer discounted auto loans to their most favorable customers. The auto lending rule, however, was unique because it was not a regulation but a lower-level guidance document outlining how the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection would enforce the anti-discrimination provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n\nThe CRA typically allows 60 legislative days for Congress to overturn a rule, but due to the guidance document's status, it did not go through the usual regulatory process. As a result, car dealers, lenders, and other interested groups never had the opportunity to provide comments, and the Obama administration never submitted it to Congress for review.\n\nIt was only after pressure from Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) that the Government Accountability Office determined the guidance was, in fact, a rule and submitted it to Congress for review. The House voted 234 to 175 to repeal the rule, and the Senate followed suit with a 51 to 47 vote. The votes were largely along party lines, with Democrats voting to maintain the rule.\n\nUnder the CRA, the bureau is prohibited from issuing any similar rule unless Congress grants it specific authority. This move to repeal the auto lending rule is part of a broader push by Congress to dismantle Obama-era regulations.",
    " Title: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Proposes Journalistic Accountability Platform Amid Media Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressed his discontent with the media, accusing big media companies of hypocrisy and pressuring journalists to maximize clicks for advertising revenue. Musk also floated the idea of creating a website, tentatively named Pravda, where users could rate the credibility of articles and journalists.\n\nMusk's tweets began with a critique of the media's credibility, stating, \"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO further claimed that journalists are under constant pressure to generate maximum clicks and advertising dollars, or risk losing their jobs. He pointed out that Tesla, unlike many other industries, does not advertise, while fossil fuel and gas/diesel car companies are among the world's biggest advertisers.\n\nIn response to a Twitter user's comment on his remarks, Musk suggested, \"the media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.\" Musk also proposed the creation of a website, possibly called Pravda, where people could rate the core truth of any article and track the credibility of a journalist or news outlet.\n\nPravda was the name of a Communist newspaper in the former Soviet Union.\n\nRecent backlash towards Tesla, due to a series of crashes involving the company's vehicles, has been a point of contention for Musk. In one incident in Utah this month, the driver of a Tesla that crashed into a truck at 60 mph told police that she had the vehicle's autopilot feature turned on. Musk responded to the incident, tweeting that it was \"super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front-page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's comments, Musk also engaged with individual reporters, including one who compared Musk's media criticism to President Trump's. In response, Musk said, \"Thought you'd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks 'You're just like Trump!'\"\n\nMusk continued, \"Because no one believes you anymore. You lost your credibility a long time ago.\" To another journalist who suggested that blaming the messenger is the new trend, Musk replied, \"Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he's above criticism.\"\n\n\"Try being truthful and the public will believe you again,\" Musk said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Despite his presence, administration officials confirm that Pence is voluntarily maintaining a distance from others due to precautionary measures.\n\nPence has consistently tested negative for COVID-19 since his exposure. Notably, President Trump's personal valet and Vice President Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, have also tested positive for the virus.

    " Title: Trump Withdraws U.S. from Trans-Pacific Partnership, Signs Executive Orders on Trade, Taxes, and Abortion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first full day in office, President Donald Trump took significant steps to implement his campaign's tough trade stance by signing an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement. The move, which was met with applause from union leaders but faced criticism from some Republican lawmakers and Democratic politicians, was part of a series of executive orders signed by the president on Monday.\n\nThe TPP, a deal between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, was not ratified by Congress despite strong support from business groups and former President Barack Obama. The withdrawal puts Capitol Hill and foreign governments on notice that the president will demand better one-on-one trade deals.\n\nTrump declared that the move was a \"great thing for the American worker.\" The president's populist stance on trade has shaken up alliances in Washington, with some prominent Republican lawmakers vowing to defend their party's traditional support for open markets and free trade.\n\nIn addition to the TPP withdrawal, Trump signed executive orders freezing nonmilitary federal hiring and reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which limits federal funding for abortions abroad. The abortion rule, which has been adopted by Republican administrations and canceled by Democratic administrations since President Reagan enacted it in 1984, is likely to fuel opposition from liberal and pro-choice groups.\n\nTrump's first full day in office was focused on the economy and jobs. He began with a breakfast meeting with prominent business leaders, outlining a plan for massive reductions in taxes and federal regulations to spur economic growth. The president also took action on thorny social issues and the federal workforce.\n\nThe three executive orders signed on Monday, along with the orders signed after the inauguration, fell short of the more than dozen actions that Trump promised to take on Day One. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the administration was pacing its executive actions to ensure they were implemented effectively.\n\nGetting the U.S. out of the TPP was a top campaign promise and part of Trump's America-first agenda, which he says will create jobs. While many Democrats also oppose the Asian trade agreement, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer dismissed the formal withdrawal from the deal as meaningless. However, some Republican lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, criticized the move, arguing that it will have lasting consequences for the U.S. economy and strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nTrump is expected to sign an executive order in coming days to begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Trump has blamed NAFTA for the massive exodus of manufacturing jobs from the U.S. since it went into effect in 1994.\n\nAt the breakfast meeting with business executives, Trump said he wanted American firms to \"make our products here again.\" He stressed that fewer regulations didn't mean increased dangers for consumers or the environment, and he plans to reduce corporate tax rates from the current 35 percent to as low as 15 percent. Trump also plans to cut income taxes for middle-class families.",
    " Title: McCain's Lone Crusade Against Susan Rice's Secretary of State Nomination Faces Skepticism from GOP\n\nArticle:\n\nThe potential nomination of Susan Rice as the next Secretary of State has set the stage for a political showdown between President Barack Obama and his 2008 rival, Senator John McCain. However, the Republican Party, as of yet, has not shown the same level of enthusiasm as McCain in opposing Rice's appointment.\n\nObama has remained silent on his choice for Clinton's successor, but his public defense of Rice last week is seen as a clear signal of his preference. If Obama does indeed nominate Rice, a public confrontation between the president and McCain is imminent. The question remains whether McCain, who has vowed to block Rice's nomination, can rally the Republican Party behind him, or if he is fighting this battle alone.\n\nThe GOP, with 45 votes in the new Senate, has the numbers to uphold a filibuster. However, a unified effort to block a Secretary of State nominee is unusual, even by the standards of today's filibuster-prone Senate. Moreover, the case against Rice appears weak, particularly in the context of McCain's criticism of her role in the Benghazi incident.\n\nMcCain's attacks on Rice revolve around her handling of the September 11 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the death of Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. In the aftermath of the attack, Rice, as the public face of the White House's response, communicated a preliminary assessment that the incident was a spontaneous response to a demonstration. However, Rice's words were based on CIA-approved talking points, and former CIA Director David Petraeus testified that he believed Benghazi was a coordinated terrorist strike. McCain alleges that Rice either showed incompetence in sticking to the talking points for several days or was engaged in a willful cover-up.\n\nMcCain has vowed to block Rice's nomination and suggested that no Clinton replacement at State should be approved until the Benghazi incident is fully investigated. However, McCain's closest Senate ally, Lindsey Graham, has refused to join in threatening to filibuster Rice. Graham stated that he would wait to hear Rice's explanation before making a decision, suggesting that McCain may not be gaining the traction he needs to block Rice's nomination.\n\nOther Republican senators, such as Marco Rubio and Joe Lieberman, have also expressed skepticism towards McCain's narrative. This lack of support from within the Republican Party casts doubt on McCain's ability to derail Rice's nomination, potentially leading to a nomination process that ends much like Condoleezza Rice's Secretary of State nomination eight years ago: with opposition, but no filibuster.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Cannot Block Twitter Users for Political Views\n\nA New York federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users for their political views, finding that such actions violate the First Amendment. In her decision on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald stated that the President's blocking of critical users is a form of viewpoint discrimination that infringes on the users' right to free speech.\n\nJudge Buchwald wrote, \"We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account... are properly analyzed under the \u2018public forum\u2019 doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe judge further rejected the White House's arguments that the First Amendment does not apply in this case and that the President's personal First Amendment interests supersede those of the plaintiffs. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nIn July 2017, Trump was sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York, along with seven individual Twitter users. At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted that Trump's tweets are official statements, and the White House often sends out official statements every time the President tweets.",
    " Title: \"Republican Strategists Vow to Break Away from Fox News' Grip as GOP Faces \"Choir-Preaching\" Problem\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, some Republican strategists have pledged to distance themselves from Fox News, aiming to address the party's perceived reliance on a single news source, often referred to as the \"Fox News bubble.\" This self-imposed exile is a response to the party's \"choir-preaching\" problem, where the message is tailored to a conservative audience rather than appealing to a broader electorate.\n\nThe relationship between the Republican Party and Fox News, which was forged during the 2012 election cycle, has been criticized as a grand experiment that ultimately resulted in a grand failure. Despite Fox News' success in catering to a hardcore, conservative audience, there is little indication that enough Republicans will be willing or able to break free from the network's influence.\n\nFox News' strategy, characterized by its slash-and-burn approach, has been effective in attracting a dedicated viewership and generating substantial profits for the network. With an estimated $1 billion in profits this year, Fox News has solidified its position as a dominant force in cable news. However, in terms of supporting a national campaign and facilitating a nationwide conversation about the country's future, Fox News' performance this year has been widely criticized as a marked failure.\n\nThe network's coverage of the 2012 election campaign has been described as an editorial and political fiasco. From the farcical GOP primary to the general election, Fox News' influence seemed to be a factor in several missteps by Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate. Whether it was misrepresenting the facts surrounding the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, parroting the Fox talking point about the \"47 percent\" of voters who are lazy and shiftless, or Romney's embrace of reality TV show host-turned Fox News commentator Donald Trump, the Republican candidate's campaign was often damaged by Fox News' rhetoric.\n\nFox News viewers were not spared either. Throughout the year, they were fed a steady diet of misinformation about the candidates and the state of the race. This misinformation, combined with skewed polling data, left many Fox viewers disillusioned on Election Night when Romney's supposed landslide failed to materialize.\n\nThe criticism of Fox News' coverage of the 2012 election has been widespread, with many commentators describing it as a failure to move the needle in favor of the Republican candidate and a detachment from campaign reality for months at a time. For instance, Fox News host Megyn Kelly's assertion in July that the Obama campaign was \"starting to panic\" was proven false.\n\nFollowing another lopsided loss to President Obama, Republican strategist Mike Murphy urged Republicans to adopt a view of America that is not based on Rush Limbaugh's dreams. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Jon Carroll even questioned whether the Fox News model had run its course, suggesting that the network's approach may no longer be effective in electoral terms.\n\nConservatives should have considered the long-term implications of handing control of a political movement to figures like Roger Ailes and his misinformation minions, as well as determining whether Fox News had an \"off switch\" to use in emergencies. As Fox News became the de facto leader of the Republican Party, the driving electoral force, and with Ailes entrenched in his kingmaker role, candidates had to court the network in search of votes and the coveted free airtime.\n\nThe Republican Establishment is often characterized as Rush Limbaugh, Roger Ailes, Karl Rove, and their media products, from Sean Hannity to Mark Levin. They dominate the talk radio airwaves and the GOP's own \"news\" channel, Fox. New York magazine labeled Ailes as \"the head of the Republican Party,\" and a GOP source told the magazine that \"You can't run for the Republican nomination without talking to Roger. Every single candidate has consulted with Roger.\"\n\nThis reliance on Fox News and its conservative media allies has led to campaigns becoming part of the network's culture of personal destruction and self-pity. Candidates were forced to adopt the network's narrative, often adopting a right-wing whine that the conspiratorial press was out to sink their campaign.\n\nThe right-wing bubble, with its combination of panic and denial, may have provided comfort to those who viewed Obama as a historic monster or required constant reminders of the president's supposed failures. However, this narrative did not prepare conservatives for the realities of the campaign season, ultimately costing the GOP a lost year in the Fox News bubble.",
    " Title: U.S. and Mexico to Hold Trade and Migration Talks as Trump Threatens Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Top officials from the U.S. and Mexico will begin talks on Monday to address President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on Mexican imports and the issue of migration at the border. The president is currently overseas, leaving others to navigate a potential trade crisis.\n\nThe president has threatened 5% tariffs on Mexican imports starting June 3, with the rate increasing by 5% every month through October, topping out at 25%. The tariff threat comes just as the administration has been pushing for passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which aims to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nMexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are set to discuss the matter on Monday. Two days later, delegations led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will also meet in Washington.\n\nTrump's frustration with the flow of migrants is not new, but it has been a recurring topic, particularly after special counsel Robert Mueller's public statement on the Trump-Russia report. The president has claimed that Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades, but he aims to end this abuse with the tariffs.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, stated on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the president is \"deadly serious\" about the tariffs. However, there are no specific benchmarks being set to assess whether the U.S. ally is stemming the migrant flow enough to satisfy the administration.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill and GOP allies in the business community have expressed serious unease with the tariffs. Some see this latest threat as a play for leverage, and doubt Trump will follow through. Earlier this year, Trump threatened to seal the border with Mexico only to change course.\n\nEconomists and business groups are sounding alarms over the tariffs, warning that they will impair trade and increase the costs of many Mexican goods that Americans have come to rely on. However, Mulvaney played down those fears, stating that American consumers will not pay for the burden of these tariffs.\n\nThe tariff threat and the ongoing immigration issue could potentially derail the USMCA negotiations. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said last week the tariffs would \"seriously jeopardize\" passage of the agreement, which needs approval in Congress.",
    " Title: U.S. Drone Shot Down in Yemen, Missile Fired at American Drone in Gulf of Oman Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of escalating incidents, an American MQ9 Reaper drone was fired upon by Iranian forces on Thursday, following the distress signal from the MV Altair tanker, which was attacked in the Gulf of Oman earlier in the day. The U.S. military reported that a missile was fired at the drone, but it missed. The U.S. has identified the missile as a modified SA-7, launched from Iran's mainland.\n\nAccording to a senior U.S. official, the first distress call from the MV Altair, a Marshall Islands-flagged but Norwegian-owned crude oil tanker, was made at 6:12am local time. The drone arrived eight minutes later. At 6:45am local time, the missile was fired at the drone.\n\nIn addition, U.S. officials have reported that a U.S. MQ9 drone was shot down in Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in recent days.\n\nThese incidents come amid heightened tensions in the region following the attack on oil tankers, which has brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of a direct conflict. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the attack on the oil tankers, citing intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.\n\nPresident Trump has also stated that Iran is responsible for the attack, citing a video showing the Iranians removing an unexploded mine from one of the vessels. However, Europe has been skeptical of Trump's claim that Iran is to blame for the tanker attack.\n\nThe incidents in Yemen and the Gulf of Oman have raised concerns about the potential for U.S. weapons falling into the wrong hands during the chaotic Yemeni war. The U.S. has not yet elaborated on its plans to defend its forces and interests in the region.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Coalesce Around Biden in Texas as Primary Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Texas primary, Democratic Representative Colin Allred has endorsed Joe Biden, marking a significant shift in support from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Representative Vicente Gonzalez, who previously supported Beto O'Rourke and later switched to Biden in September, has been instrumental in rallying the caucus behind Biden's candidacy.\n\nBiden's campaign has announced endorsements from a group of former Beto O'Rourke and Julian Castro supporters in Texas since Castro endorsed Elizabeth Warren. This list includes state representatives Rafael Anchia, Ryan Guillen, Eddie Lucio III, Oscar Longoria, and Armando Martinez.\n\nPreviously, Biden's team announced the support of former San Antonio Mayor Phil Hardberger, state senator Jose Menendez, state representatives Rhetta Bowers and Garnet Coleman, and Dallas County Clerk John Warren. He also has the backing of Texas representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Filemon Vela.\n\nBiden, who currently leads in public polls in Texas, is expected to campaign in the state this week with fundraisers scheduled in Dallas and Houston. In CNN's December poll of the state, Biden garnered 35 percent support, 20 points ahead of Bernie Sanders, his nearest competitor.\n\nRepresentative Allred, who represents a battleground district, compared Biden's appeal to that of former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, stating that they also had the ability to win over disaffected Republicans and independents while also turning out the Democratic base.\n\n\"Joe Biden will certainly win Texas on Super Tuesday, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that he does,\" Allred said. \"He has an appeal in Texas that is undeniable, and anybody who's seen him come through the state will have recognized that. Texans, I think, recognize also that his brand of politics, which is really about bringing people together around ideas that we can deliver on, is one that I think we also support.\"\n\nAllred's endorsement follows a report by \u2588\u2588\u2588 that vulnerable House Democrats are coalescing around Biden amid fears that a more liberal nominee could cost them their seats. Representatives Conor Lamb and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Elaine Luria of Virginia endorsed Biden earlier this month, as did Iowa Representative Abby Finkenauer.",
    " Title: The Persistent Challenge of Partisan Outrage: A Reflection on the Founding Fathers' Warnings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe modern political landscape in the United States is a testament to the warnings issued by the Founding Fathers about the dangers of political factions. George Washington, in particular, cautioned against the divisive nature of political parties, which he referred to as \"factions.\"\n\nIn his time, Washington observed that these factions, driven by self-interest, would agitate the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms. This observation rings true in today's political climate, where parties are often seen as conglomerates of ideologically-aligned groups, such as feminists, gays, blacks, and those who prioritize issues like religion, guns, and traditional values.\n\nThomas Jefferson, another Founding Father, famously stated that he would not go to heaven with a party. This sentiment is echoed in today's political sphere, where parties are often seen as a means to an individual's or group's interests, rather than the nation's.\n\nThe problem arises when factions take over political parties, leading voters to confuse loyalty to factional interests with loyalty to the country's interests. Elections become a contest of which factions have gained control of which parties.\n\nIn the 2008 election, Hillary Clinton's campaign was criticized for her disdain for the notion that her election would be significant because she would be the first woman president. This time, that notion is a central theme of her campaign. She aspires not just to be a good president, but the first woman president.\n\nThis approach appeals to some feminists, who fear being labeled as self-loathing or bigoted for thinking independently. However, this mindset often lacks an inquiring mind, choosing to accept political narratives without question.\n\nThe dilemma of choosing a president based on superficial similarities, such as gender or race, can lead to risky decisions. For instance, many white Southerners voted for Jimmy Carter due to his accent, only to find that he governed in a manner that was perceived as weak and indecisive. Similarly, millions of black voters were seduced by the prospect of a black president, leading to a political landscape that is still grappling with the consequences.\n\nThe human tendency towards factionalism, driven by jealousies, prejudices, and self-interest, has been a constant since the birth of the nation. The original American ideology was based on the subordination of narrow, selfish interests to the greater good. However, political parties have evolved into entities that often prioritize their interests over the common good.\n\nThe Founding Fathers, products of the English republican tradition, could not have imagined the corruption and manipulation of language by lawyers and judges. They envisioned a political process that identified the common good and then sought to promote it.\n\nHowever, the body politic has fractured into factions, making the search for the common good increasingly difficult. The electorate has evolved into self-interested winners and bitter losers, fighting over what constitutes the common good. As we look around, it is clear that this evolution is far from ideal.\n\n-Wesley Pruden, Editor Emeritus of The \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: Second Round of ObamaCare Sign-ups Begins Amidst Challenges and Improved Shopper Experience\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second round of ObamaCare sign-ups commences this Saturday, with a goal of enrolling 3 million Americans and re-enrolling the approximately 7 million individuals who enrolled during the fall of 2013. This year, 77 new health insurance providers are participating, signifying a business opportunity in the marketplaces.\n\nPresident Obama has urged consumers to review their options on the health care website, stating they could potentially save money or find a better plan. The enrollment period ends on February 15, and Obama emphasized the urgency of consumers acting promptly.\n\nThe initial enrollment period was marred by technical issues, as the federal and some state-run ObamaCare websites experienced crashes, failed to fully register some customers, and provided incorrect information. However, these problems have been resolved, and federal officials have stated that the federal site is now improved and ready for the new enrollment period.\n\nDespite the improvements, the Affordable Care Act continues to face opposition. A recent Associated Press-GfK poll found that 56% of Americans would prefer to repeal the law, while only 41% would implement it as written. The Republican-controlled House is rekindling its attack on the law, with proposed hearings and investigations during the lame-duck congressional session on issues such as premium increases and the law's impact on the federal deficit.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge on the law's tax credits, which make premiums affordable for millions. However, the poll also found that 61% of respondents expect the law to be implemented in its current form or something similar.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, who has been tasked with managing the problematic program, expressed confidence in the sign-up season's success. She stated that the tax credits will continue, at least for the time being, and that the Supreme Court is unlikely to hear the case until the spring, after the 2015 open enrollment is over.\n\nWebsite outages are a possibility this year, but a full-scale meltdown seems less likely. HealthCare.gov has been revamped to handle peak loads and beyond. The federal website will serve as the online portal for coverage in 37 states, while the remaining states run their own insurance exchanges. Consumers can also apply in person or through call centers.\n\nThe pool of potential customers is estimated to be 23 to 27 million people who do not have access to affordable coverage on the job. For most newcomers, the online application has been simplified, with the number of computer screens reduced from 76 to 16. Navigation is easier, and window shopping is available without first having to create an account.\n\nPremiums for 2015 are a wild card, with the average increase expected to be modest. However, prices can vary dramatically from state to state, even within regions of a state. Many returning customers could face premium increases if they do not shop around.\n\nThe administration is seeking to lower expectations, with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell's target being a total enrollment of 9.1 million people in 2015, a 28% increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had estimated the number would nearly double, to 13 million people enrolled next year.\n\nThis sign-up period will be the first time that renewal has been tried for current customers, and it also overlaps for the first time with tax-filing season. For those already signed up, coverage will renew automatically if they do nothing, but that may not produce the best result. Returning customers could miss out on lower-premium options and get stuck with outdated and possibly incorrect subsidies. In most cases, they have until December 15 to update their income information or switch insurance plans, in order to have the changes take effect on January 1.\n\nThe tax issues will emerge during next year's filing season. Current customers who received tax credits this year will have to file new tax forms to prove they received the correct amount. Too much subsidy, and their tax refunds will be reduced. Too little, and the government will pay them.\n\nPeople who remain uninsured risk a penalty that will be deducted from their tax refunds. Millions may qualify for waivers, but getting exemptions could involve a paperwork ordeal. Community-based counselors helping uninsured people report strong interest, but they express concerns about this year's abbreviated sign-up season.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Dick Cheney Warns of North Korean Crisis, Citing Unpredictable Leader Kim Jong Un\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare and significant move, former Vice President Dick Cheney has expressed concern over the ongoing North Korean crisis, warning that the unpredictable and potentially unstable North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, poses a serious threat to global security.\n\nDuring a meeting with GOP lawmakers on Tuesday, Cheney reportedly offered a blunt assessment of the crisis on the Korean peninsula, stating, \"We're in deep doo doo.\"\n\nThe concern over North Korea's actions is not just limited to the political arena in Washington, D.C. Residents on the U.S. west coast, particularly those in Hawaii, Guam, the Pacific Islands, and other areas within range of North Korea's missiles, are reportedly feeling the brunt of the tension.\n\nAccording to recent U.S. intelligence, North Korea is believed to have completed preparations for mobile ballistic missile launches, and is likely to test fire them at any time. This has prompted countries in northeast Asia to remain on edge, with Japan deploying missile defense systems around Tokyo and some Chinese tour groups cancelling visits to North Korea.\n\nU.S. radars and satellites are also trained on an area of the Korean east coast where North Korea is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch.\n\nAdm. Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, has characterized the crisis as a \"clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability.\"\n\nAs the world waits for Kim Jong Un's next move, experts are concerned that the North Korean leader may have painted himself into a corner, with few options left that do not involve a missile launch. The fear is that, in a bid to assert his power, Kim Jong Un may feel compelled to follow through with a launch, potentially leading to a dangerous escalation of tensions.\n\nPresident Obama and his security team are reportedly preparing for a possible response, should North Korea proceed with a missile launch. The response would need to be swift and decisive, sending a clear message that the U.S. is not playing games and is ready to take action if necessary.\n\nAs the situation remains volatile, the world watches and waits, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The stakes are high, and the potential consequences of inaction or miscalculation are grave. The hope is that cooler heads will prevail, and that the world can avoid a catastrophic conflict.",
    " Title: Reflection on the Evolution of the Civil Rights Movement: A Comparative Analysis of Martin Luther King Jr. and Al Sharpton\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years after the historic March on Washington, the American civil rights movement has undergone a significant transformation, with the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the contemporary civil rights movement led by figures like Al Sharpton standing in stark contrast.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the March on Washington serves as a poignant moment to reflect on the evolution of the civil rights movement. The Dream, as it was famously coined by Dr. King, was a glorious triumph that changed America forever and made it more just. The contemporary civil rights movement, in part, is a consequence of this success, grappling with a different set of challenges and controversies.\n\nThe contrast between Dr. King and Al Sharpton is a testament to the evolution of the civil rights movement, from a movement of great men confronting grave injustices to a movement that, at times, seems to be more about media attention and fundraising. Dr. King operated under the ever-watchful eye of the FBI, facing physical threats and working tirelessly to advance the cause of civil rights. In contrast, Sharpton's career is marked by a series of questionable actions and statements, including the defamation of individuals and inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nDr. King's moral philosophy was deeply rooted in the biblical prophets and Reinhold Niebuhr, and he believed that \"unearned suffering is redemptive.\" He was a practiced Baptist preacher who wedded the cadences of the Bible to the nation's founding ideals under the unbearable pressure of historic events. Sharpton, on the other hand, has been criticized for his lack of apology for past actions, such as falsely accusing a man of rape and denouncing a Jewish businessman as a \"white interloper.\"\n\nThe contemporary civil rights movement is often criticized for its focus on manufactured controversies and imagined slights, rather than addressing the real issues facing the community. The movement's success in achieving many of its goals has left it in a position where it is no longer confronting a system of American apartheid, but rather grappling with the challenges of cultural breakdown and the complexities of modern society.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in his speech at the March on Washington anniversary, attempted to draw parallels between the struggles of the past and the present, but many argue that these comparisons are strained and misunderstand the nature of the contemporary challenges facing the black community. The contemporary civil rights movement is often criticized for using the charge of racism to shut down argument and deflect uncomfortable conversations, rather than engaging in open and honest dialogue about the issues at hand.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of the civil rights movement from the time of Dr. King to the present day is a complex and nuanced story. While the movement has achieved many of its goals and made significant strides in advancing civil rights, it is also facing new challenges and controversies. It is important to remember the legacy of great men like Dr. King, who sacrificed so much to advance the cause of civil rights, and to strive for a more open and honest dialogue about the issues facing the black community today.",
    " Title: New Developments in Obama's National Security Team: Kerry as Secretary of State, Hagel for Defense, and Morell for CIA\n\nArticle:\n\nWith John Kerry stepping out of the running for the Secretary of State position, there is a strong presumption that he will be appointed to the role, according to a senior State Department official. However, the final decision is not yet made, as the current lineup, which includes Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and Michael J. Morell as the permanent CIA director, is seen as reminiscent of past national security teams.\n\nFor President Obama, a national security team led by John Kerry, Chuck Hagel, and Vice President Joe Biden Jr., would be a team with deep experience but also, in many ways, a conventional one. All three have been in the Senate for a significant amount of time before Obama, and they describe themselves as pragmatists rather than ideologues. They have all been skeptics and critics of the American experiment in Iraq from the early days of the war.\n\nAt present, there are no serious candidates for the State Department job other than John Kerry. He would be the first white man to serve in the post since Warren Christopher left in early 1997. His successors have been Madeleine K. Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nJohn Kerry's colleagues in the Senate have expressed confidence in his ability to sail through confirmation hearings. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has already begun jokingly referring to him as \"Mr. Secretary.\" Both men are veterans of the Vietnam War and worked together to provide President Bill Clinton with political cover to grant diplomatic recognition to Vietnam. McCain said of Kerry recently that he would most likely win a large number of Republican votes for confirmation.\n\nThe composition of Obama's team has come under renewed scrutiny following the withdrawal of Condoleezza Rice. If she keeps her current post as ambassador to the United Nations, she will remain in Obama's cabinet and on his national security team. She is also considered the likely successor to Thomas E. Donilon as national security adviser. However, Donilon does not intend to leave that post for a year or two, his friends say, unless he is named White House chief of staff.\n\nMich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense for policy, remains a candidate to become the first female defense secretary. However, in internal discussions, White House officials have said that the challenge of the next few years will be working with Congress to shrink the defense budget and kill some major cold war-era weapons systems. For that, Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, is seen as better able to win votes from his former colleagues.\n\nMs. Flournoy has also been mentioned as a possible CIA director, but Michael J. Morell, who ran the analysis division of the agency, is the favorite of CIA officials. \"Mike has been concerned about the over-militarization of the CIA,\" a senior military officer who has dealt with him said recently. \"And so are many at the agency, who fear they have wandered too far from the job of analyzing trends and obtaining secrets.\"\n\nJohn Brennan, a close aide to Obama and a former agency station chief in Saudi Arabia who has directed counterterrorism activity from his basement White House office, is also a candidate for CIA director. However, officials note that his current post already gives him sway over all 18 intelligence agencies.\n\nJohn Kerry has worked hard to deepen his relationship with Obama. The president has at times considered him long-winded and a throwback to a previous generation of diplomats, aides said. However, Kerry impressed Obama and Donilon when he was sent to deal with Hamid Karzai, the famously unpredictable president of Afghanistan, after Karzai's supporters rigged a presidential election in 2009 and refused a second round of voting.\n\nKerry also visited Pakistan several times to try to ease recurrent tensions, including a two-week visit after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials tried to get Kerry to write what they called a \"blood oath\" that the United States would never take action to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

    " Title: Internal Strategy Documents Reveal Clinton Campaign's Media Relationships and Influence Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of leaked internal strategy documents and emails, the friendly and collaborative relationships between the Hillary Clinton campaign and various U.S. media members have come to light, along with the campaign's strategies for managing these relationships. The documents, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, were reportedly provided by the self-proclaimed hacker Guccifer 2.0, who has been linked to significant hacks, including the Democratic National Committee breach that led to the resignations of its top officials.\n\nOn Friday, Obama administration officials claimed that Russia's \"senior-most officials\" were responsible for the DNC hack, although they provided no evidence to support this assertion. As these documents demonstrate, a key component of the Clinton campaign strategy is shaping media coverage to their advantage by working closely with journalists perceived as favorable to Clinton.\n\nIn some cases, Clinton's campaign staff drafted stories they wanted published, specifying what should be quoted \"on background\" and what should be described as \"on the record.\" A January 2015 strategy document, designed to plant stories about Clinton's decision-making process regarding her presidential bid, singled out reporter Maggie Haberman, then of Politico and now with the New York Times, as a \"friendly journalist\" who had \"teed up\" stories for them in the past and \"never disappointed\" them.\n\nNick Merrill, the campaign press secretary, produced the memo, according to the document metadata. When given more than 24 hours to challenge the authenticity of these documents and respond, Merrill did not reply to our emails. Haberman declined to comment.\n\nOther documents listed those whom the campaign regarded as their most reliable \"surrogates\" \u2013 such as CNN's Hilary Rosen and Donna Brazile, as well as Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden \u2013 but also operatives whom they believed were either good \"progressive helpers\" or more potentially friendly media figures who might be worth targeting with messaging. The metadata of the surrogate document shows the file was authored by Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director of the campaign.\n\nAs previously reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588, pundits regularly featured on cable news programs were paid by the Clinton campaign without disclosure when they appeared; several of them are included on this \"surrogates\" list, including Stephanie Cutter and Maria Cardona.\n\nThe Clinton campaign also favored glitzy, intimate, completely off-the-record parties between top campaign aides and leading media personalities. An April 2015 memo, produced by deputy press secretary Jesse Ferguson, described an April 10 cocktail party for leading news figures and top-level Clinton staff at the Upper East Side home of Clinton strategist Joel Benenson, a fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign's messaging.\n\nA separate email chain between Clinton staff (one that was not among those provided by Guccifer 2.0 but appeared on the DCLeaks.com site earlier this week) contains plans for a separate off-the-record media get-together in May. Food and drinks were provided by the campaign for the journalists covering it, on the condition that nothing said would be reported to the public.\n\nMany of the enduring Clinton tactics for managing the press were created by the campaign before she even announced her candidacy. A March 13, 2015, memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook provides insight into some of the tactics employed by the campaign to shape coverage to their liking. In particular, Mook was concerned that because journalists were assigned to cover Clinton, they needed to be fed a constant stream of stories that the campaign liked. As he put it, a key strategy was to \"give reporters who must cover daily HRC news something to cover other than the unhelpful stories about the foundation, emails, etc.\"",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Walks a Tightrope as He Tries to Balance Law and Order with Social Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a delicate balancing act, Vice President Mike Pence is attempting to inject a more conciliatory tone into the Trump administration's response to the ongoing anti-racism protests, while maintaining a semblance of alignment with President Donald Trump's \"law and order\" positioning.\n\nThe White House meeting with state attorneys general, police union representatives, and local sheriffs underscores the fine line Pence must navigate. This role, often described as a presidential translator, has seen Pence intervene in diplomatic kerfuffles, reassure allies, and spin away problematic comments made by the president.\n\nDuring a news conference last Friday, Pence offered a refined version of Trump's Rose Garden message, emphasizing economic stability as the key to addressing racial injustice. However, during a subsequent listening session with business owners and black pastors, Pence acknowledged that economic healing alone would not deliver racial justice.\n\nAllies of Pence highlight his adaptability as a defining characteristic, setting him apart from his defiant boss. This trait could potentially benefit the administration during this period of social unrest.\n\nReverend Charles Harrison, an African American pastor who worked closely with Pence during his time as Indiana governor, expressed hope that significant changes would result from the current social upheaval. Harrison, who has shared his honest perspective on race relations with Pence, noted the challenges faced by the black community in their interactions with law enforcement.\n\nThroughout the 2016 election, Pence maintained a pro-police stance, aligning with the tough-on-crime platform he and Trump ran on. However, the killing of George Floyd has highlighted differences between the president's strategy and that of his deputy. While Trump has made incendiary comments about protesters and praised himself for the economy, Pence has engaged in quiet outreach to affected communities.\n\nThe contrast between Trump's hard-line comments and Pence's outreach is emblematic of the challenge Republicans face as they grapple with the president's racially charged rhetoric and the desire among some party figures to build a broad, inclusive coalition. This challenge is further illustrated by the contrasting actions of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who participated in a faith-based protest against police brutality, and Trump's tweets criticizing Romney and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n\nReverend Harrison expressed concerns about the tone of the president's remarks but looks forward to discussing the issue with Pence. This exchange underscores the delicate dance Pence is performing as he attempts to balance the administration's law-and-order stance with the need for empathy and understanding in the face of ongoing social unrest.",
    " Title: Half of U.S. COVID-19 Deaths Occur in Nursing Homes, Says Research\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis by the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP) reveals that nursing homes and long-term care facilities account for more than 40% of COVID-19 fatalities in 39 states that report the location of deaths. This figure may be underestimated, as some states exclude deaths that occur in hospitals but were initially contracted in nursing homes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 2.1 million Americans live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, which is 0.6% of the total population. The data, which includes facilities for people with disabilities and hospice programs, shows that 42% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in these facilities.\n\nNew York, which has experienced a large COVID-19 outbreak, has the lowest nursing home death rate at 13.8%, but outside of New York, more than half of all COVID-19 fatalities nationally were residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Researchers at the International Long Term Care Policy Network found that 40.8% of reported COVID-19 fatalities across 18 countries took place in nursing homes.\n\nThe high number of deaths in nursing homes can be attributed to several factors. Most residents of nursing homes are elderly or infirm, with many suffering from long-term ailments or weakened immune systems. People live close together, sharing living quarters and common spaces like cafeterias. The coronavirus also spreads more efficiently indoors.\n\nSome states made policy choices in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic that may have made nursing homes even more vulnerable to the disease. Governors in some states, including Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, prevented nursing homes from turning away patients with active COVID-19 infections. This policy likely contributed to the spread of the disease to some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nOther states, like Florida, have locked down nursing homes and prioritized shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) to these facilities, putting them on the same level as hospitals. This may explain why Florida has had fewer overall deaths than other large states, despite 40% of those deaths occurring in nursing homes.\n\nAs states emerge from total lockdowns and begin to restart their economies, policies must adapt to reflect the growing body of evidence about COVID-19 vulnerabilities. The overall fatality rate of the disease is now estimated to be about 0.3%, lower than was feared at earlier stages in the crisis. We also know more about how the disease spreads and which populations need the most protection.\n\nAvik Roy, president of FREOPP, writes that the concentration of deaths in nursing homes means that the 99.4% of the country that does not live in these facilities is roughly half as likely to die of the disease. This suggests that schools and many businesses can be reopened without the risk of huge spikes in hospitalizations or deaths. States must learn from their earlier missteps in handling nursing home outbreaks and focus on saving the lives most at risk. The coronavirus is a long-term problem, but the next step in fighting it is for governments to lift economically ruinous lockdowns when possible and prioritize protecting the most vulnerable populations.",
    " Title: Media Matters Accuses Hannity of Defending Child Sex Abuse, Sparks Advertiser Exodus from Fox News Show\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the left-wing activist group Media Matters has escalated its campaign against Fox News host Sean Hannity by using allegations surrounding Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore as a tool to pressure Hannity's advertisers. The group is accusing Hannity of defending child sex abuse, a claim Hannity has explicitly denied.\n\nMoore, the GOP Senate candidate, is currently under scrutiny for allegations of sexual misconduct, including making sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32, and pursuing romantic relationships with other teenage girls around the same time. Hannity, however, has stated that anyone guilty of such actions has no place in politics.\n\nIn an attempt to influence Hannity's sponsors, Media Matters operatives have been smearing Hannity, claiming he defends child sex abuse. For instance, Angelo Carusone, Media Matters' president, tagged a sponsor of Hannity's show while accusing Hannity of defending \"sexually preying on children.\"\n\nOn November 11, 2017, coffee company Keurig announced that it would be pulling ads from Hannity's show in response to such allegations. In a tweet, Keurig stated, \"We worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.\"\n\nThis decision sparked a backlash from Hannity supporters, with some calling for a boycott against the coffee company. Hannity, in a tweet on November 13, 2017, thanked his supporters for mobilizing in his defense, writing, \"I am humbled and speechless and frankly laughing my ass off. I love all my deplorable friends. Thank you and Game on!\"\n\nAnother sponsor, Realtor.com, also announced that it would not be running ads on Hannity in the future. In a tweet, the company stated, \"While we continually strategize on where we advertise on and offline, we are not currently, and will not be running TV ads on Hannity.\"\n\nMedia Matters has been targeting Hannity's advertisers for months. In August, the group launched a \"Stop Sean Hannity\" campaign, publishing a list of Hannity's sponsors and urging left-wingers to let advertisers know that they \"will get burned if they continue to associate with Hannity.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Media Matters has targeted Hannity's advertisers. In May, the group targeted Hannity after he pushed a conspiracy theory surrounding murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich. This campaign caused several advertisers, including military insurance group USAA, to pull their ads from Hannity's show. The backlash extended to advertisers of MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and other liberal hosts, leading to USAA eventually reinstating its advertisements on both MSNBC and Fox News.\n\nMedia Matters' efforts to defund Hannity come after they and other left-wing activists successfully pressured Fox News into firing Bill O'Reilly following sexual harassment allegations against the host.",
    " Title: McConnell and Schumer Disagree on Witness Testimony in Upcoming Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected demands from Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer for live testimony during the impending impeachment trial against President Trump. McConnell accused the Democrats of wanting to clean up the House's mess, as they now seek to call additional witnesses beyond those the House chose to pursue.\n\nDuring a speech on the chamber floor, McConnell criticized the House for failing to pursue \"useful witnesses\" in court and for bypassing due process. He stated that the House's articles of impeachment, as they stand, are inadequate to prove the alleged charges.\n\nMcConnell's remarks follow a letter and press conference by Schumer earlier this week, where he demanded live testimony from four key witnesses, including White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, senior adviser Robert Blair, former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, and his associate deputy director Michael Duffey. These individuals, according to Schumer, have direct knowledge of President Trump's decision-making regarding aid to Ukraine.\n\nSchumer argued that conducting a trial without facts would imply a fear of transparency or a desire to conceal something. He stated, \"To conduct a trial without the facts is saying we are afraid. We have something to hide.\"\n\nThe two leaders are expected to meet soon to agree on rules and procedures for the trial, which is set to begin next month. The disagreement over witness testimony is a significant point of contention in the upcoming trial, with both parties seeking to present their respective cases.",
    " Title: Kanye West Distances Himself from \"Blexit\" Campaign, Political Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, rapper Kanye West has distanced himself from the \"Blexit\" campaign, a movement encouraging black Americans to leave the Democratic Party. The announcement came in a series of tweets on Tuesday, where West clarified that he had no involvement in the campaign and was disassociating himself from politics.\n\nWest specifically addressed Candace Owens, the black conservative who spearheads the \"Blexit\" campaign, stating that he had merely introduced her to the designer of the \"Blexit\" logo, and that his name was used when the original designer declined to be associated with the campaign.\n\n\"I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn\u2019t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it,\" West tweeted.\n\nFurthermore, West expressed his disillusionment with politics, stating that he had been used to spread messages he doesn't believe in. He declared his intention to focus solely on his creative pursuits, as evidenced by his subsequent tweet: \"My eyes are now wide open and now realize I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative!\"\n\nAlthough West prepared the ground for his political disengagement, he had previously outlined a political platform that, on the surface, seemed less MAGA-compliant. His platform included supporting job creation, prison reform, common-sense gun laws, and holding those in power accountable. He also expressed support for law enforcement, asylum seekers, and parents fighting to protect their children from violence and war.\n\nThis development marks a significant shift in West's public political stance, following his high-profile meeting with President Trump at the White House earlier this year. The rapper, who once wore a \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) hat, has been a vocal supporter of the President, but it appears his political involvement may be coming to an end.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Announces Republican Members for Benghazi Select Committee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya in 2012, House Speaker John A. Boehner has announced the seven Republican members of the newly formed select committee tasked with investigating the incident. The committee, chaired by South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy, a former prosecutor, aims to explore security lapses, the U.S. response, the Obama administration's initial portrayal of the attack, and efforts to pursue the attackers.\n\nCommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy, known for his tough questioning of former Internal Revenue Service official Lois G. Lerner, has pledged to conduct a serious and fair investigation. \"This is a serious investigation. I don't want theater; I don't want a sideshow,\" Mr. Boehner said in an interview with Fox News. \"I want the members of this committee to find the facts for the four families who lost their loved ones, and the facts for the American people.\"\n\nThe committee's makeup includes a mix of experienced lawmakers with backgrounds in oversight, intelligence, and military affairs. The two women appointed are Martha Roby, a second-term congresswoman from Alabama, and Susan W. Brooks of Indiana, a former U.S. attorney. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the oversight panel and a former chairman of the Republican Study Committee, was appointed to represent conservatives.\n\nPeter J. Roskam, another Republican member, serves as chief deputy whip and represents Speaker Boehner's leadership team on the panel. Mike Pompeo of Kansas and Lynn A. Westmoreland of Georgia, both members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, were also appointed.\n\nWhile some rank-and-file Democrats have praised Trey Gowdy, the party remains undecided about participating in the investigation. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, accused Republicans of using the tragedy as a political tool and to raise campaign funds ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nTrey Gowdy and Chairman Trey Gowdy reiterated their commitment to a fact-finding mission and pledged to avoid using the Benghazi investigation for political gain. However, they pointed out that Democrats have also raised funds using other controversial topics, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The select committee is expected to begin its work in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson Requests Internal Investigation After Being Found Asleep in Car\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has asked the city's police department to conduct an internal investigation on himself Thursday after he was found lying down in a car.\n\nA passerby found Johnson early Thursday in a car parked near a stop sign and called 911. Police department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Johnson indicated he parked his car after feeling lightheaded. Officers checked on Johnson's well-being and did not observe any signs of impairment.\n\n\"There were no charges of intoxication, no information of intoxication as far as I know,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nGuglielmi says Johnson requested the investigation because he believes officers and the superintendent \"ought to be held to the highest standard.\"\n\n\"So what that means is they're going to interview the officers, they're going to look at all available evidence just to make sure that this is above-board and happened as described,\" Guglielmi said.\n\nThe 59-year-old Johnson underwent kidney transplant surgery in August 2017. His son Daniel was the donor.\n\nGuglielmi said Johnson visited a doctor earlier this week regarding a medication change. He said the superintendent on Wednesday expressed concerns about feeling exhausted. Guglielmi says Johnson visited a doctor Thursday to be evaluated on issues concerning his blood pressure.\n\nJohnson was hospitalized in June after doctors found a small blood clot in his lung during a stress test done as Johnson approached the two-year anniversary of his transplant. The clot was treated with medication and rest.\n\nJohnson was appointed superintendent in March 2016 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. His predecessor, Garry McCarthy, was fired days after the release of a video of the 2014 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder last year and is serving a nearly seven-year prison sentence.",
    " Title: Time Magazine Names Pope Francis Person of the Year for Shifting Catholic Church's Message and Capturing Global Imagination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic decision, Time magazine has named Pope Francis as its Person of the Year for 2013. This marks the third time a pope has been bestowed this honor, with Pope John Paul II receiving it in 1994 and Pope John XXIII in 1963.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff, known for his visits to the poor and his preference for subway travel during his tenure as archbishop of Buenos Aires, beat out other notable figures such as former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, gay rights activist Edith Windsor, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas.\n\nTime's cover story praises Pope Francis for capturing the imagination of millions who had lost faith in the Catholic Church. The magazine credits him with elevating the healing mission of the church, focusing on its role as a servant and comforter to the world's hurting people.\n\nThe selection was made by Time's editors, who considered suggestions from the magazine's more than 2 million Twitter followers. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi praised the recognition, stating that it signifies the world's acknowledgment of spiritual, religious, and moral values, and Francis's advocacy for peace and justice.\n\nIn September, Francis gave a groundbreaking interview, expressing a desire for the Vatican to move away from an obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception, and homosexuality, and towards a more merciful approach. In July, he made headlines by stating that he would not judge homosexuals who are of good will and in search of God, a departure from his predecessor, Benedict, who considered homosexuality an intrinsic disorder.\n\nPope Francis's style is characterized by frugality, as he has chosen to live in a small suite in a Vatican guest house instead of the spacious papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, and prefers a Ford Focus over the traditional pope's Mercedes. A champion of the downtrodden, he visited the island of Lampedusa in July to pay tribute to hundreds of migrants who had perished crossing the sea from North Africa.\n\nHowever, the Catholic Church has been marred in recent years by sex abuse scandals. In an effort to address this issue, Francis formed a team of experts on Thursday to consider ways to improve the screening of priests and protect minors, as well as help victims.\n\nDespite these efforts, Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), a victim advocacy group, has called for more action, stating that, after nine months of relative inaction, Francis has not made a single child safer.\n\nThis article is a neutral, factual, and informative account of Time magazine's selection of Pope Francis as its Person of the Year, highlighting his impact on the Catholic Church and the world at large.",
    " Title: Economic Struggles in Communities Near National Parks Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown, currently in its eighth day, is causing economic hardships for communities near national parks, particularly those that rely on tourism and outdoor recreation. The small town of Terlingua, Texas, located near Big Bend National Park, is one such community feeling the impact.\n\nThe Big Bend Natural History Association estimates a loss of about $35,000 per week from reduced sales at its bookstores in closed park buildings. The Far Flung Outdoor Center, a local resort and outfitter, has reported a half dozen cancellations at its dozen cabins.\n\nGreg Henington, owner of the Far Flung resort and a local outfitter, expressed concern, stating, \"The uncertainty is what hurts us the most.\"\n\nWhile the overall economic impact of the shutdown is limited, communities dependent on national parks for economic activity are experiencing fewer visitors and less spending at area businesses such as hotels, restaurants, outfitters, and bookstores.\n\nThe National Parks Conservation Association estimates that, during this time of year, there are usually half a million visitors a day to the nation's 400 parks. This traffic generates approximately $18 million daily for nearby communities, from the Everglades in Florida to Yosemite in California.\n\nKathryn Petralia, co-founder of Kabbage, an online small business lender, noted that small- and medium-size businesses are turning to loans to cover potential delays in receiving Small Business Administration loans due to federal staffing cuts.\n\nIn Macon, Georgia, the Ocmulgee National Monument, which attracts about 157,000 visitors a year and generates an estimated $9 million, is closed. This has affected tourism, with visitors unable to see artifacts including ancient ceremonial and burial mounds in the monument.\n\nGary Wheat, chief executive officer of Visit Macon, the city's tourism booster, expressed concern, stating, \"We see a lot of repeat travelers, but if you\u2019re not open, you risk losing those people from coming back.\"\n\nIn Port Angeles, Washington, near Olympic National Park, the main road to the winter play area called Hurricane Ridge has been closed due to a lack of staff to plow a mountain road. This has resulted in the closure of the Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area, costing about $5,000 a day in lost revenues and leading to the furlough of about 16 part-time workers.\n\nIn Big Bend National Park, disruptions during a seasonally busy time have occurred. Nearly 10% of the park's 440,000 annual visitors come in December when desert temperatures are mild. Campgrounds were closed on Wednesday \"due to sanitation and resource impact concerns,\" according to a notice on the park's website.\n\nOther national parks are facing issues such as garbage buildup due to a lack of maintenance. The National Park Service has a contingency plan to close areas if issues arise.\n\nCommunity members and business owners are hopeful that the shutdown will be resolved soon to alleviate the economic strain on their communities.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Republican Primary Results Highlight Deep Divide Within GOP, Potential for Contested Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Wisconsin Republican primary, Senator Ted Cruz managed to secure a significant victory over front-runner Donald Trump, capturing 48 percent of the vote compared to Trump's 35 percent. This win, however, does not necessarily indicate that Cruz is \"uniting the Republican Party,\" as he claimed in his victory speech. Instead, it signifies that Cruz is consolidating his role as the \"anti-Trump\" in a race that has plunged the GOP into crisis.\n\nAccording to analysts for ABC News, more than half of Cruz's supporters, and two-thirds of Ohio Governor John Kasich's, expressed fear of a Trump presidency, rejecting the leading candidate in the race. Among Cruz's own voters, only a quarter were excited about his presidency, suggesting that he garnered substantial anti-Trump, not necessarily pro-Cruz, support.\n\nGovernor Kasich underperformed in Wisconsin with only 14 percent of the vote, but he remains adamant about taking his campaign to the convention as the only \"mainstream\" Republican still in the race. This, however, has resulted in a split of the anti-Trump vote.\n\nThe GOP faces a potential challenge in the general election, as primary voters' responses to a hypothetical match-up between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton reveal. If Trump is the party's nominee, only 61 percent of GOP primary voters said they would vote for him, with 19 percent saying they would vote for a third-party candidate, 10 percent saying they would vote for Clinton, and 8 percent saying \"no one.\"\n\nIf it's Cruz vs. Clinton in November, only 66 percent of Wisconsin Republicans said they'd back Cruz, with 18 percent saying they'd vote third party, 6 percent saying Clinton, and 6 percent saying \"no one.\" These numbers reflect a deep divide within the GOP between Trump supporters and Republican voters who oppose him.\n\nTrump's negatives among general election voters are sky-high, but Cruz and Clinton also have high negatives. Kasich argues he's the most electable, and general election matchups bear that out, but his path to the nomination through a contested convention is impossibly narrow. He'll need to convince a deadlocked convention that a candidate who finished at the back of the pack deserves to jump the line.\n\nThe next test comes in two weeks with the New York primary, home turf for both Trump and Clinton, who, like Trump, needs to overcome an embarrassing defeat in Wisconsin. If either underperforms, it will be clear that Wisconsin was a turning point. Both will be damaged, but still on track to head to their respective conventions with the most delegates. The math, at this stage in the race, is almost impossible to overcome.",

The decision was announced on McInnes' channel on Monday.\n\nMcInnes, who has been banned from various social media platforms in the past, had amassed nearly a quarter-million subscribers on YouTube. In August, Twitter suspended his account before a \"Unite the Right\" rally in Washington, D.C., and at the end of October, Facebook and Twitter banned McInnes and Facebook groups affiliated with the Proud Boys, following a report by the Daily Beast.\n\nThe ban comes after McInnes used his account to promote his infamous Oct. 12 speech at a New York Republican club, which ended with his Proud Boy followers brawling in the street with left-wing activists. To promote the speech, which celebrated the decades-old murder of a Japanese socialist, McInnes posted pictures of himself on Instagram in racist \"Asian eyes\" glasses. In the aftermath of the event, McInnes\u2014who recently made his account private\u2014posted a picture of the Japanese assassination with a Nike slogan superimposed over it: \"Just do it.\"\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, The Blaze announced on Saturday that McInnes would not be working with them, although roughly one week before the outlet had announced he would be hosting a show. McInnes, who before becoming an alt-right figurehead was best known for co-founding Vice, was poised to host \"Get Off My Lawn,\" a show that was reportedly similar to his \"Get Off My Lawn\" podcast. BlazeTV co-president, Gaston Mooney, had previously touted McInnes as a \"provocateur,\" telling CNN that he was \"one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys have been under scrutiny in recent months, with a Washington state sheriff's office issuing a report in mid-November stating that the FBI considers the Proud Boys to be an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism. However, last week, The Oregonian reported that according to Oregon's top FBI agent, the FBI had not designated the Proud Boys as an extremist group. Special Agent in Charge Renn Cannon told reporters that the FBI never intended to designate the Proud Boys as an extremist group when it briefed Clark County law enforcement leaders about regional threats.\n\nCannon continued, stating that the FBI \"tried to characterize the potential threat from individuals within that group,\" adding that the FBI does not designate groups but does investigate violent conspiracies. He stated, \"We do not intend and did not intend to designate the group as extremist... That was not our intention. That's not what we do. We will not open a case if someone belongs to antifa or even the Proud Boys. There has to be a credible allegation or a threat of violence before someone opens a case.\"",
    " Title: Theresa May Steps Down as Conservative Leader, Triggering Leadership Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant speech at Downing Street, Theresa May announced her resignation as Conservative leader, marking the end of her turbulent three-year premiership. The prime minister, who became the second female prime minister in British history, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve the country she loves.\n\nMay's decision follows intense pressure from her own party, particularly from the Tory 1922 Committee, which was prepared to trigger a second vote of no confidence in her leadership if she refused to resign. The prime minister's fate was sealed after a 10-point \"new Brexit deal\" announced in a speech on Tuesday infuriated Tory backbenchers and many of her own cabinet.\n\nMay's announcement comes as the Conservative Party is expected to suffer dire results in Thursday's European elections. The prime minister will remain in Downing Street to shoulder the blame for these anticipated poor results and to host Donald Trump when he visits.\n\nThe 1922 Committee will set out the terms of a leadership contest, which is expected to begin on 10 June and last perhaps six weeks. The Conservative Party has set out the following timetable for the leadership contest: nominations closed on 10 June, the first round of voting was held on Thursday 13 June, and subsequent rounds have been pencilled in for the 18th, 19th, and 20th. The postal vote element, when the 140,000 or so party members will pick the country's new prime minister, will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22 July.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, is the frontrunner to be Britain's next prime minister, but more than a dozen senior Tory figures are considering throwing their hats into the ring. Rory Stewart has already announced his candidacy, while Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, and Sajid Javid are all likely contenders.\n\nMay's departure comes after three years of wrangling with Brexiters on her own backbenches about what future relationship with the European Union they would be prepared to accept. The loss of her majority at the 2017 general election, after spearheading what was widely regarded as a disastrous campaign, made it increasingly difficult for her to deliver on Brexit.\n\nTheresa May's longtime friend, Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, defended her record on Friday. Green said, \"All prime ministers, in the end, take responsibility for what happens on their watch, but I think that it's undeniable that suddenly and unexpectedly becoming prime minister after the seismic shock of the Brexit referendum meant that she was dealt an extremely difficult hand to play. And the truth is that having an election a year later, which cut the Conservative party's majority, then [made it] impossible.\"\n\nGreen also commented on the current state of British politics, stating, \"The fact that parliament has not been able to get a Brexit deal through has led to the impatience, bordering into contempt, for the political class and the amount of hostility and borderline violence is something we have not known for a very very long time.\"",
    " Title: Parallels Between Watergate and Clinton Email Scandal: A Retrospective Analysis by Bob Woodward\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview, the journalist who brought down the Watergate scandal, Bob Woodward, has drawn parallels between the ongoing Hillary Clinton email scandal and the drawn-out battle over the White House tapes during the Nixon era. The Clinton email scandal, which once seemed to be a mere footnote in the Democratic nominee's path to the presidency, is now casting a shadow over her candidacy, with speculation mounting that she could face criminal charges for mishandling classified documents.\n\nWoodward, who was a young staffer in the Nixon White House, has identified eerie similarities between the two scandals. In 1972, Richard Nixon was poised for a landslide re-election, with foreign policy successes and a robust economy. However, the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office building and the subsequent investigation led to a political downfall that mirrors the current situation surrounding Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Watergate scandal unfolded as investigative reporters Woodward and Carl Bernstein published revelations about the investigation on the front page of the Washington Post, with details of the investigation emerging weekly. The special prosecutor, appointed to investigate wrongdoing, summoned Nixon's staff for public testimony and closed-door meetings.\n\nIn the digital age, Hillary Clinton's email controversy is no less complex. Despite deleting emails, it is unlikely that they have been permanently erased, as they may exist on other people's computers. The question remains: why did Clinton have a private email system in the first place, and did she believe she could control the historical record and fashion her own legacy?\n\nClinton's refusal to turn over her emails in the initial stages of the investigation has raised questions about what she may be hiding. The administration's sudden reversal of course, allowing inquiries into Clinton's emails, has fueled speculation that the investigations are politically motivated. Clinton is now being investigated by three government agencies: the Justice Department, the State Department, and the Intelligence Community.\n\nThe Clinton email scandal may not reach the earth-shattering proportions of Nixon's forced resignation from office in August 1974, but it could present Clinton with insurmountable difficulties in her quest to become the first woman president. The irony is palpable, as one of the staff members on the Watergate Committee that investigated Nixon's files and tapes was a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, all over again.",
    " Title: Orange County's Political Shift: From Republican Stronghold to Democratic Edge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Orange County, California, was still the most Republican county in the United States in terms of raw numbers. The political landscape was dominated by the Republican Party, with Democrats being an afterthought. However, the county's political identity has undergone a significant transformation, as evidenced by the latest voter registration figures that show a slight advantage for Democrats over Republicans.\n\nRepublican Representative Robert Dornan, a conservative icon, was a familiar face at the county's election night parties, often attended by Democratic officials as well. Dornan's loss to Democrat Loretta Sanchez in the 1996 congressional election was a sign of things to come, and the county's Republican dominance began to wane.\n\nOrange County was not just Republican but was often referred to as the Republican Mecca, having propelled political figures like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon to national prominence. However, the county's defense-based economy and demographics have changed, leading to a shift in its political leanings.\n\nThe county's Republican Party has struggled to maintain its influence, with Democrats making significant gains in recent years. In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton received more votes than Donald Trump, and Democrats took every Orange County congressional race in the midterms.\n\nThe shift in Orange County has far-reaching implications for the state as a whole. California Republicans once relied on the county's overwhelmingly Republican vote totals to overcome their disadvantage in statewide races. With Orange County's most populous county now evenly split, the question remains: where will Republican votes come from to help balance Democratic strongholds elsewhere?\n\nThe recriminations over the shift in political allegiance are ongoing, with some blaming the president, immigration, or the party's leadership. Regardless of the cause, the Republican Party in California needs to adapt to the changing political landscape or risk continued decline.\n\nIn Orange County, 27% of voters are No Party Preference, and statewide, No Party Preference registrants have surpassed GOP voters. The number of registered Democrats has fallen by about 110,000 since the 2016 election, while the number of Republicans has dropped by about 340,000.\n\nThere is opportunity in these numbers, but the Republican Party's poor leadership and outdated thinking have hindered their ability to capitalize on these issues. Road congestion, a housing crisis, service cutbacks, crime hikes, poverty rates, and growing pension liabilities are all issues that resonate with voters but have not been effectively addressed by the Republican Party.\n\nAt the state level, Republicans have been obliterated in recent elections, with the two non-liberal candidates who came closest to winning in the last election cycle both lacking the GOP label. Former Republican Steve Poizner ran for insurance commissioner as No Party Preference and lost by nearly 6 percentage points to Democrat Ricardo Lara. Pro-charter-school candidate Marshall Tuck came within 2 percentage points of teachers' union ally Tony Thurmond in the nonpartisan race for superintendent of public instruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the shift in Orange County's political landscape serves as a stark reminder of the Republican Party's decline in California. The party needs to adapt to the changing political landscape or risk continued decline. As Ronald Reagan once said, \"The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.\"",
    " Title: Florida Governor Rick Scott's Decision to Expand Medicaid Program Sparks Controversy Among Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy among conservatives, Florida Governor Rick Scott, a vocal critic of Obamacare in the past, has announced that Florida will accept federal funds to expand its Medicaid program. The decision has been met with criticism from some conservatives who see it as a capitulation on Scott's part, especially as he is up for re-election in a state with a notably high elderly voting population.\n\nHowever, the situation is more nuanced than it seems, as Charles Krauthammer explained on 'Special Report' last night. \"You can act honorably either way,\" Krauthammer said. \"You can oppose [Obamacare] and then say you lost the fight. It's the law of the land. It passed through Congress and got the signature of the president. It was approved by the Supreme Court. And, when the president ran for reelection against somebody who would abolish it, the president wins...[I] think it's honorable to say 'I will take the money because people in my state are paying federal taxes, are subsidizing people in other states,' or you could argue it the other way and say 'I still want to keep up the fight and that if enough states stay out, it'll collapse.'\"\n\nThe decision to expand Medicaid is a pragmatic one, as Obamacare is unlikely to be repealed anytime soon. Voters had an opportunity last November to elect a candidate who promised to repeal the president's health care law in full, but they declined. Now, it seems, Governor Scott is adhering to one of President Kennedy's old injunctions: Deal with the world as it is, not as you might want it to be.\n\nIt is worth noting that Florida, under Governor Scott's leadership, led the charge to repeal Obamacare in state and federal court immediately after it was signed into law. However, standing on principle now doesn't seem as important to Scott anymore, even though he spent millions of dollars out of his own pocket to help overturn the law.\n\nMeanwhile, scores of other states with conservative chief executives have refused to participate in the program, including Louisiana, Texas, and Wisconsin, among others. The question remains: Despite Governor Scott's heretofore impeccable conservative bona fides, is it really that hard to believe he would capitulate and reverse his position on the Medicaid expansion program now that he's up for re-election in a purplish state with a notably high elderly voting population? Hmm.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Reallocation of Funds for Government-Funded News Outlet Amidst Media Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially reshape the media landscape in the United States, President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reallocating funds to Voice of America (VOA), a government-funded news outlet, to serve as a domestic news source. The proposal, if implemented, could see VOA, which currently broadcasts to 236.6 million people worldwide, take on a more significant role in shaping domestic perceptions of the U.S. administration.\n\nVOA, with an annual budget of $218.5 million, has traditionally served foreign audiences, but in 2013, it became available domestically. The organization's director, Amanda Bennett, has previously stated that VOA would \"absolutely\" not be \"manipulated by the Trump administration.\"\n\nPresident Trump's interest in VOA comes amidst ongoing criticism from the media, particularly during his presidency. The president has been vocal about his displeasure with media coverage, often citing inaccuracies and bias. This has led to a strained relationship between the White House and various media outlets.\n\nIn the past, Trump has threatened to challenge or even shut down media outlets he dislikes, but it appears he is now considering a different approach with the proposed reallocation of funds to VOA. The move, if successful, could potentially provide Trump with a more compliant news source, mirroring the state-controlled media models seen in countries like Russia and North Korea.\n\nHowever, the proposal is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how this development will unfold. Critics argue that such a move would undermine the principles of a free press, while supporters of the president see it as a means to combat perceived media bias.\n\nAs the situation evolves, it is clear that the future of media in the United States could be significantly altered, with potential implications for the country's democratic process and international standing.",
    " Title: \"Grassley's Letter to Attorney General Lynch Raises Questions over Uranium One Deal and Clinton Foundation Ties\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a series of emails released by WikiLeaks has revealed a potential connection between the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal, a controversial transaction that granted a Russian company control over a significant portion of America's uranium reserves. The emails, belonging to John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, suggest a close relationship between the Clinton campaign and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on June 30, 2015, expressing concerns about the Uranium One deal and the Clinton Foundation's ties to the transaction. The letter, which was recently made public, was sent to key members of the Clinton campaign, including Jennifer Palmieri, Kristina Schake, Tony Carrk, and Christina Reynolds.\n\nThe email thread, initiated by Maura Pally, a communications staffer at the Clinton Foundation, alerts Podesta and the campaign team about Grassley's letter. The email states, \"Putting on all of your radars that Grassley sent a letter to AG Lynch (dated June 30th though we just saw it) asking questions about contributions to the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal.\"\n\nThe Uranium One deal, approved in 2010, transferred control of U.S. uranium assets to Rosatom, a Russian government-owned company. The transaction raised national security concerns due to the foreign involvement, which resulted in the ceding of 20% of U.S. uranium production capacity to the Russian government.\n\nGrassley's letter to Lynch requests answers to several questions regarding the Department of Justice's role in the Uranium One deal, the involvement of DOJ personnel, and whether Clinton's relationship with the Clinton Foundation required her to recuse herself from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review of the Uranium One deal. The letter also questions whether Attorney General Holder was briefed about the House Judiciary Committee's demand for a DOJ investigation into the uranium transaction and its approval by the State Department.\n\nThis revelation adds another layer to the ongoing debate about the Clinton Foundation's ties to various business transactions and the potential influence these ties may have had on Clinton's actions during her tenure as Secretary of State. The full extent of these ties and their impact on the Uranium One deal remains to be seen as the investigation continues.",
    " Title: Trump Pardons Dinesh D'Souza, Contemplates Pardons for Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday pardoned conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza and said he was considering pardoning lifestyle maven Martha Stewart and commuting a former Illinois governor's prison sentence, prompting critics to accuse him of subverting the rule of law.\n\nTrump announced on Twitter his decision to pardon D'Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to U.S. campaign finance law violations and was an outspoken critic of Democratic former President Barack Obama, saying he had been \"treated very unfairly by our government.\"\n\nThe Republican president then told reporters on a flight to Houston he was also considering a pardon for Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and making false statements in an insider-trading probe.\n\nJames Comey, whom Trump fired as FBI director last year and has repeatedly assailed, was the lead federal prosecutor in Stewart's case and played a role in the prosecution of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Trump pardoned Libby in April.\n\nTrump also said he might commute the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat convicted of corruption charges, and was considering pardoning a woman convicted of a drug-related charge after reality TV star Kim Kardashian discussed the case with him on Wednesday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley, briefing reporters on Air Force One as Trump later flew to Dallas for Republican fundraising events, denied that celebrity was a consideration in whom the president decides to pardon.\n\n\"Look, there are plenty of people the president is looking at right now under the pardon process,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons, and Trump sometimes has used that authority to benefit convicted figures revered by some on the political right such as former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio and Libby.\n\nAfter D'Souza's pardon, some constitutional scholars, legal analysts, and Democratic lawmakers accused Trump of undermining the rule of law with pardons based on political considerations.\n\nCritics said the president was sending a message to people caught up in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia, including his longtime private lawyer Michael Cohen, whose business dealings are separately under scrutiny in New York.\n\n\"Trump's Dinesh D'Souza pardon today, on top of his pardons of Scooter Libby and Joe Arpaio, make sense only as an elephant-whistle to Michael Cohen & all who know damning things about Trump: protect me & I'll have your back. Turn on me & your goose is cooked. More obstruction!\" Harvard Law School constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"As with the pardon of Joe Arpaio, Trump is sending a message that he will reward political allies for loyalty with get-out-of-jail-free cards,\" Democratic U.S. Representative Don Beyer said on Twitter. \"He doesn't care about the rule of law.\"\n\nTrump denies any collusion with Russia and has called Mueller's probe a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nD'Souza, 53, admitted in 2014 he illegally reimbursed two \"straw donors\" who donated $10,000 each to the unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate campaign in New York of Wendy Long, a Republican he had known since attending Dartmouth College in the 1980s.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years of probation after telling the judge he was ashamed of his actions and contrite. \"I can not believe how stupid I was, how careless, and how irresponsible,\" D'Souza wrote in a statement to the judge.\n\nSome conservatives complained of selective prosecution of D'Souza. The prosecutor, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, was an Obama appointee later fired by Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, D'Souza thanked Trump in Twitter posts that also slammed Bharara. \"KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: @PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired & I got pardoned,\" D'Souza wrote.\n\nBharara earlier said on Twitter: \"The President has the right to pardon but the facts are these: D'Souza intentionally broke the law, voluntarily pled guilty, apologized for his conduct & the judge found no unfairness. The career prosecutors and agents did their job.\"\n\nStewart and Blagojevich both were involved with Trump's \"Apprentice\" reality TV television show.\n\nBlagojevich was convicted of corruption offenses including soliciting bribes for appointment to the U.S. Senate seat Obama vacated after being elected president in 2008.\n\nLast August, Trump pardoned Arpaio less than a month after his conviction for criminal contempt in a case involving racial profiling of Hispanics. Arpaio was known for his crackdown on illegal immigrants in Arizona's Maricopa County.\n\nLibby was convicted in 2007 of lying in an investigation into the unmasking of a CIA agent.\n\nTrump last week posthumously pardoned boxer Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, who was jailed a century ago because of his relationship with a white woman.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Candidates and the Influence of Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, both candidates are facing the challenge of portraying their policies as capable of shaping the American economy and global events, despite the limited influence the U.S. presidency has over certain international issues.\n\nStephen D. Biddle, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated, \"Both candidates tacitly agree to pretend that their policies are capable of righting the American economy while their opponent's would sink it, when the reality is that both are in thrall to foreigners' choices to a degree that neither would acknowledge.\"\n\nPresident Obama's trip to Mexico for the Group of 20 leaders' gathering is a reflection of the priorities that incumbents often face. While he discusses the European financial crisis and meets with European leaders, his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, tours swing states.\n\nThe president will also meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, following allegations by the Obama administration that Moscow has been supplying arms to Syria during its crackdown on the uprising. Simultaneously, U.S. officials will hold talks in Moscow with Iran, aiming to curb Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nForeign policy concerns are not a top priority for American voters, with only 4% of respondents in the latest New York Times-CBS News poll citing it as their top election concern. However, Mr. Romney has occasionally used foreign policy to criticize Mr. Obama's presidency, stating that, regarding Israel, he would \"just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite.\"\n\nKristen Silverberg, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush who is advising Mr. Romney, criticized the Obama administration, stating, \"These crises reflect an absence of leadership from the Obama administration. He sat out the Iran protests, has faltered on Syria, and let the Russians know he'll be even more 'flexible' after our election.\"\n\nJamie M. Fly, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a conservative group, expressed concern that the current foreign policy approach is failing to address issues such as Syria, Iran, the European economic crisis, and a resurgent Russia.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by foreign policy, it offers advantages for a president. International travel on Air Force One, meeting with world leaders, and taking decisive action against terrorists can convey a statesmanlike image. However, such actions can also attract criticism, as seen in the response to Mr. Romney's comments about Israel over the weekend.\n\nBen LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, dismissed Mr. Romney's comments as \"politics,\" stating, \"Our relationship with Israel is too important for Governor Romney to play politics with it.\"\n\nMr. Obama's record on foreign policy, including the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the toppling of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government in Libya, and robust action against terrorists, is often cited as an advantage. James M. Goldgeier, dean of American University's School of International Service, described Mr. Obama as \"the first real national security Democrat since President John F. Kennedy.\"\n\nHowever, the European economic crisis remains a significant challenge for Mr. Obama, as its impact on the U.S. economy is substantial. Nancy E. Soderberg, a national security aide and United Nations diplomat under President Bill Clinton, noted, \"Europe's weakness is likely to blow back on Obama's efforts this fall\u2014just at the wrong time.\"\n\nIn conclusion, foreign policy is a complex and multifaceted issue that both candidates are grappling with in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. While the U.S. presidency may have limited influence over certain international events, the candidates must present their policies as capable of shaping the American economy and global events to secure the support of voters.",

The National Weather Service has reported tornadoes and torrential rains, leading to widespread flooding in affected areas.\n\nAuthorities in Oklahoma have confirmed four deaths due to the weekend's storms. During a press conference, Houston Mayor Annise Parker reported that two bodies have been recovered in the city. In addition, media outlets have reported four other fatalities in Texas, and at least 12 individuals are currently missing.\n\nPresident Obama described the flooding as \"terrible\" and spoke with Texas Governor Greg Abbott this morning. He assured the governor that federal aid would be forthcoming, stating, \"I assured Gov. Abbott that he could count on the help of the federal government. We have FEMA personnel already on the ground. They are coordinating with Texas emergency management authorities, and I will anticipate that there will be some significant requests made to Washington. My pledge to him is that we will expedite those requests.\"\n\nLouie Bond, a magazine editor and former editor of Wimberley's newspaper, described the situation in the affected towns as \"terrible.\" He stated, \"It had been raining here for weeks, a lovely wet spring after years of drought. The ground was saturated.\" Wimberley and nearby San Marcos, two towns along the Blanco River, seem to have been the hardest-hit areas in the United States.\n\nHowever, the city of Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, a Mexican city of approximately 140,000 on the border due west of San Antonio, was also severely impacted. A tornado that struck at sunrise on Monday leveled blocks of buildings, resulting in at least 13 fatalities.\n\nIn Oklahoma, two people have been reported dead: a firefighter in Claremore, near Tulsa, who was swept into a storm drain on Sunday, and a Tulsa woman who died on Saturday after her vehicle hydroplaned on a highway.\n\nThe Weather Channel reports that some parts of Texas, which were experiencing a drought not long ago, have received over 20 inches of rain this month. Houston received more than 10 inches of rain last night, causing water to pool in city streets and even on highways. Interstate 10, a major east-west thoroughfare in the city, was closed this morning, and Twitter users shared pictures of cars apparently floating across Interstate 45.\n\nMayor Parker stated that while large parts of the city were \"high and dry,\" some highways and neighborhoods remained inaccessible.

In total, an estimated 600 protests were scheduled in cities spanning from New York City to Los Angeles.\n\nThe marchers included open-border advocates as well as conservatives who argue against family separations. The total number of protesters could rise to hundreds of thousands, according to some reports. Social media was flooded with photos of those participating and watching the demonstrations.\n\nIn New York City, protesters chanted \"Shut detention down,\" a reference to demonstrations held at ICE offices across the country. Barry Hooper of San Francisco told the Associated Press he attended the protest with his wife and two daughters to \"let the president know that this is not acceptable.\" Liliana, his 7-year-old daughter, held a sign she made that read, \"Stop the separation.\"\n\nProtesters in San Francisco carried flags and signs with slogans that read, \"Deport Trump,\" and \"I Really Care, Do You?\" - a jab at the words written across a jacket the first lady wore during a visit to an immigrant detention center.\n\nCelebrities and politicians who oppose Trump were among those participating in a demonstration in Los Angeles, according to the Associated Press. California Democrats who turned out for the event included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Migrant children taken from their parents will suffer lifelong trauma, Harris said.\n\nA rally near the city hall in Portland, Maine was so large that police shut down streets as a reported 2,000 people \"chanted, cheered and prayed,\" the wire service reported. In downtown Denver, an estimated 4,000 people attended a boisterous rally. Some of the protesters wore foil blankets, a symbol of similar blankets they gave to children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOthers carried signs that included the messages: \"Keep the kids, deport the racists\" and \"Break walls, build families.\" Elsewhere, smaller groups banded together in city parks and downtown squares in virtually every state. Some carried tiny white onesies with the words, \"What if it was your child?\" and \"No family jails,\" according to reports.\n\nThe rallies were funded by the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and The Leadership Conference, Fox News reported. Local organizers did most of the planning and coordination efforts. Many of them used informal networks that formed during the worldwide women's marches that happened on Trump's inauguration and its anniversary, the report stated.\n\nAs the protests were underway, Trump doubled-down on the immigration issue through a series of tweets, including:\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: \"Parallel Lives: A Look at Mitt Romney's Governorship and the Massachusetts Legislature\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the November elections, the focus will be on the differences between President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney. However, their lives share a striking similarity, as both have served as top political executives. This article is the latest installment of NPR's \"Parallel Lives\" series, examining Mitt Romney's four-year tenure as governor of Massachusetts (2003-2007).\n\nDuring his time in office, Romney faced a Legislature that was 85% Democratic. He attempted to boost the number of Republicans during his first two years, but this effort was unsuccessful, with Republicans losing seats in the midterm elections. Frustrated, Romney shifted his focus to individual achievements, stating, \"From now on, it's me-me-me.\"\n\nWithin weeks, Romney unveiled a universal health insurance plan, which became his signature accomplishment as he launched a 2008 bid for the White House. Passing this bill required close collaboration with Democrats, and at its signing at Boston's Faneuil Hall, Romney spoke as a political uniter.\n\nAt the bill's signing, Romney was joined by Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009. The two men had debated sharply on the same stage in 1994 during Romney's unsuccessful bid to unseat Kennedy. In 2006, Kennedy praised Romney, saying, \"To our governor, and to our Senate president and our speaker, we all say, 'Well done.'\"\n\nBoston University political historian Thomas Whalen suggests that passing the state's health care law pushed Romney outside his comfort zone. \"He was capable, you know, when he was willing to, to get down in the trenches, [to] cut deals, to get his reform health care package through,\" he says. \"And he did with remarkable success.\"\n\nApart from health care, Romney defined success not with big-picture legislative accomplishments but with confrontation. In a 2008 campaign ad, Romney boasted about taking on his Legislature, vetoing hundreds of spending appropriations as governor. Romney issued some 800 vetoes, and the Legislature overrode nearly all of them, sometimes unanimously.\n\nAt a recent Obama re-election rally on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse, Democratic legislator Pat Haddad was heckled by Romney supporters. Haddad warned that if Romney is elected president, \"You're gonna get the same guy who never wanted to engage the Legislature. He never wanted to look for new jobs; he was always only looking for his next job.\"\n\nRomney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams counters that such criticism is a result of Romney's willingness to shake up the status quo. \"Obviously, when you do that and make the tough decisions, you're not going to make friends everywhere,\" he says.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader Richard Tisei praises Romney for tackling a $3 billion deficit and closing the budget gap without increasing taxes. However, the Obama campaign recently released an ad criticizing Romney's time as governor, claiming the state under Romney had \"one of the worst economic records in the country.\"\n\nBy the end of his term, Romney's approval rating in Massachusetts was only 34%. In recent polls, the number has barely changed. Political historian Whalen attributes this to Romney's inability to meet the high expectations he set during his time in office. This is a critique often leveled against the president whom Romney seeks to unseat.",
    " Title: Romney's Foreign Policy Vision Remains Similar to Obama's, Campaign Aides Express Concerns Ahead of Final Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final debate on Monday, Mitt Romney's advisers anticipate a challenging encounter, as the debate's focus on foreign policy is an area of strength for President Barack Obama. This apprehension is not merely about setting expectations; Romney's advisers genuinely fear that the swing voters they aim to attract are currently uninterested in foreign affairs.\n\nThe differences between the two candidates on significant foreign policy issues, such as ending the Afghan war and the Syrian conflict, are minimal, making it difficult for Romney to draw clear distinctions. Despite this, Romney's campaign views the debate, to be moderated by Bob Schieffer in Boca Raton, Florida, as the last opportunity to make a significant impact in the swing states that will decide the election.\n\nThe Romney campaign enters the debate more confident about their chances than before the first presidential debate, but they believe Obama is slightly better positioned in the states that will determine the outcome. The campaign hopes that Romney will not worsen his position in the debate.\n\nVin Weber, the Romney campaign's special adviser on policy, stated, \"The debates have not so much fundamentally changed the race as they have returned it to where it was before the Democratic convention. The candidates are close, and the economy is the Number One issue. Foreign policy is really important, but it is not driving this election.\"\n\nA top Republican official was more blunt: \"I don't think there are a lot of soft voters who are waiting to hear a position on the Eurozone.\"\n\nThis could be problematic for Romney, as another strong debate performance could be the deciding factor for him. Interestingly, both campaigns agree on the state of the race as of this weekend: Obama currently holds a slight edge due to his lead in the Midwest states of Iowa, Wisconsin, and, most importantly, Ohio. A sweep of the Midwest swing states makes a Romney victory unlikely.\n\nHowever, Romney is performing better than ever in Florida, is a slight favorite in Colorado, and is back to near-even in Virginia, offering more hope than before the first debate, which Romney won decisively.\n\nRomney acknowledges that foreign policy is not his strong suit, according to his advisers. Throughout the campaign, from his statement about Russia being the biggest strategic threat to the U.S., his bumpy Europe trip, and his politicized response to the Libya killings and the ensuing debate exchange about that terrorist attack, Romney has not excelled when trying to add a global dimension to his campaign.\n\nMatt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a Democratic-leaning think tank, commented, \"So far, Romney is batting zero when it comes to landing a punch on foreign policy or national security. He has whiffed in every single at-bat, and there's no evidence he can do any better when he's doing it for 90 minutes.\"\n\nBennett added, \"It's just more opportunity for him to get boxed in like he did in the second debate, or sound out of touch like he did in the post-Libya press conference, or make a gaffe like he did on his foreign trip.\"",
    " Title: Revitalizing NATO: A Call for Tough Decisions and Unity in the Face of Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of growing diversity and shifting geopolitical landscapes, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is grappling with the need for tough decisions to maintain its relevance and effectiveness. The recent comments by President Donald Trump regarding the defense of Montenegro, a new NATO member, have sparked a conversation about the alliance's core principles and its ability to deter potential aggressors.\n\nThe essence of NATO lies in the mutual defense clause, Article V, which states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. This collective deterrence is crucial, as an aggressor is deterred when they realize their intended target has powerful allies ready to defend it. However, as the alliance has expanded and become more diverse, questions about shared traditions, values, agendas, and national-security threats have arisen.\n\nOriginally, NATO's European members saw themselves as kindred neighbors under the nuclear umbrella of the United States. The inclusion of West Germany in 1955 altered the alliance's mission, no longer just keeping the U.S. in and the Soviet Union out, but also raising Germany up rather than keeping it down. NATO's collective defense was designed to offer breathing space against the superior forces of the Soviet Red Army.\n\nAs the threat of the Soviet Union has receded, NATO has evolved from a defensive military alliance to a de facto cultural institution aimed at homogenizing Europe along Western lines. For some in Europe, NATO is not so much a collection of planes and tanks, but an expanded version of the European Union.\n\nThe more diverse NATO has become, the less unified it has become. Many of the newer members are not integrated into Western Europe and are spread across the continent. They include former Russian allies such as Albania, Bulgaria, and Montenegro. Many of the newer members are small and vulnerable, and in crises would need far more help than they could provide others.\n\nThe idea of NATO has changed, and tough decisions, not more weary and sanctimonious rhetoric, are needed to revitalize the alliance. NATO must insist that all members quickly meet their military obligations of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense. If a rich country in peace reneges on its promise of military readiness, why would anyone expect it to fulfill its pledge of assistance in wartime?\n\nNATO should also insist on common values and agendas, and its members should formally identify their likely collective enemies. The alliance must ensure that any nation in NATO belongs in NATO\u2014and thus is worth risking what could become a nuclear war on its behalf.\n\nThe expansion of NATO's borders and membership is another contentious issue. With the inclusion of countries like Albania and Montenegro, questions have been raised about the alliance's geographical boundaries and the potential for further expansion. The addition of Austria, Finland, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, and Serbia, among others, has been suggested, but these proposals have sparked debate about the alliance's core mission and its ability to maintain unity in the face of such diversity.\n\nAnother challenge lies in the internal dynamics of the alliance, as demonstrated by the strained relationship between Turkey and its NATO allies. Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey is becoming an updated version of the old Islamic Ottoman caliphate, an enemy of the Kurds and Israel, both staunch U.S. allies. If Turkey gets into a \"defensive\" conflict with Israel, would young soldiers from Kansas want to risk death to \"defend\" an anti-American, authoritarian NATO theocracy from a pro-American liberal democracy?\n\nIn conclusion, NATO faces significant challenges in maintaining its unity and effectiveness in the face of growing diversity and shifting geopolitical landscapes. Tough decisions, not more weary and sanctimonious rhetoric, are needed to revitalize the alliance and ensure its continued relevance in the 21st century. The alliance must insist on common values, agendas, and military obligations, and it must ensure that any nation in NATO belongs in NATO, worth risking what could become a nuclear war on its behalf.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Debate on Iran's Nuclear Program: A Closer Look at the Unseen Aspects\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nThe ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1, including the United States, have been a subject of intense debate and speculation. The narrative of the Obama administration, portraying the talks as a significant success, has faced challenges since the announcement of the April Fool's Day 'framework' in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nDivergent accounts of the agreement, with the European Union, France, Iran, and the U.S. presenting differing versions, have led to questions about the nature of the agreement itself. As Amir Taheri pointed out in a piece for the New York Post, the diplomatic discussions have resulted in a \"diplomatic dog's dinner\" of competing and contradictory statements, rather than a concrete agreement.\n\nTaking a step back, it becomes apparent that the focus on centrifuges, enrichment levels, inspection regimes, and sunset clauses may be mere window dressing. The real Iranian nuclear weapons program, it is suggested, may be hidden behind a veil of secrecy, guarded by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS-Iran's primary intelligence agency).\n\nWhile it is well-known that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered the IRGC to pursue nuclear weapons in the waning days of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, details about the subsequent 25-year Iranian commitment to this order are less publicized. The so-called \"father of the Pakistani bomb,\" Abdul Qadir Khan, revealed in documents obtained by the Washington Post in 2010, that Pakistan provided Iran with blueprints and parts for centrifuges and shared its secret list of worldwide suppliers. This is how the Iranian nuclear weapons program was initiated.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the public were unaware of this until the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), exposed Iran's program in August 2002. The Iranian regime, a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), responded with a plan to limit the damage, with the Iran Lobby in America playing a key role in this damage control operation.\n\nSites like Natanz, Isfahan, Arak, and Fordow, which were exposed, became the centerpiece of the regime's new information operation. They were opened to IAEA inspections, featured prominently in the IAEA's quarterly reports, and were included in the P5+1 nuclear negotiations agenda.\n\nHowever, sites like Parchin, a military site where the IAEA believes Iran has conducted nuclear trigger explosives tests, and other suspicious sites like Khondab and Lavizan-3, now revealed publicly but left off the agenda, remain untouched. The critical issues, it seems, are not about the number of centrifuges or the level of enrichment, but rather the unmentioned and untouched secret parallel nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn the next part of this series, the critical role of the Iran Lobby will be examined.\n\nClare M. Lopez is the Vice President for Research & Analysis at the Center for Security Policy.\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Establishment Republicans Optimistic as Primary Results Loom, Key Senate Races in Kentucky, Georgia, and Oregon Await\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Tuesday's Senate primaries in Kentucky, Georgia, and Oregon approach, establishment Republicans express optimism that the right candidates will emerge, potentially tipping the balance in their favor and bringing the party one step closer to Senate control.\n\nThe primary race in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing a challenge from tea party candidate Matt Bevin, is the most closely watched contest. Despite polls indicating a landslide victory for McConnell, the margin could be crucial in the November general election, where he will face off against Kentucky Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nRecent polls predict McConnell could win by 20-30 percent, but a significant turnout for Bevin on Tuesday could indicate a challenging road ahead for McConnell in the general election. A poll from Friday by Surveys USA shows a match-up between McConnell and Lundergan Grimes is currently too close to call, with Grimes at 43 percent and McConnell at 42 percent.\n\nIn Georgia, where Sen. Saxby Chambliss is retiring, the race is predicted to result in a run-off in July between the top two vote-getters. Businessman David Perdue, who is new to public service, is currently polling up to 10 percent higher than Chamber of Commerce-backed Rep. Jack Kingston. If Perdue goes on to be the nominee, the odds of securing a victory in November could be against him, given that only seven sitting senators have never previously held elected office.\n\nHowever, the Democratic recruit, businesswoman Michelle Nunn, is a first-time candidate, and recent polls indicate that Perdue is currently in single-digit leads against Nunn in a potential match-up. Polls also show that a match-up between Nunn and Kingston puts Nunn ahead by an average of just 2.5 percent.\n\nIn Oregon, Republicans are keeping a close eye on the fortunes of pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby, who is facing off against state Rep. Jason Conger. Wehby has looked poised for a sure victory, but a report that emerged Friday alleging Wehby stalked an ex-boyfriend may have dented her momentum going into the final days. It's unclear to what extent the news may have damaged her chances, particularly given that many Oregon voters vote by mail.\n\nIf Wehby wins, she would go on to challenge Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who narrowly won in 2008. Early polls indicate Wehby would be running neck-and-neck with Merkley, giving the GOP a credible chance to take the seat. One poll in April gave Wehby a 4-point lead, while another gave Merkely a 12 percent advantage.\n\nWhile a Republican has not been elected senator in Oregon in over 10 years, the primary results on Tuesday will provide insight into the direction of the race and the party's chances in November.",
    " Title: Proposing a Pre-Designed Randomized Clinical Trial for Acute Infectious Diseases: A Solution for Ebola and Future Epidemics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the potential for cases to emerge in the United States, a call for a pre-designed randomized clinical trial for acute infectious diseases has been proposed. The idea is to minimize the bias of personal judgment and permit a head-to-head comparison of treatment efficacy during an epidemic.\n\nThe proposal suggests that health authorities should pre-design a generic randomized clinical trial for acute infectious diseases. The trial design, vetted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and appropriate ethics committees, would be ready for implementation when a possible outbreak occurs.\n\nWhen an outbreak is imminent, the President, via the Surgeon General, would declare a public emergency, and the pre-approved generic trial would be launched. The treatment choices would be determined by a panel of experts, such as those knowledgeable in Ebola virus, to provide their best judgments.\n\nPatients would then be offered the possibility of enrollment in the randomized clinical trial, with the aim of continuously learning what works and what does not, and continuously improving treatment. This approach would allow for an orderly and informed response to an epidemic, an approach that could be exported to other countries as well.\n\nThe idea stems from the realization that, during past epidemics, such as the severe E. coli outbreak in Germany three years ago, individual treatment judgments varied, leading to sub-optimal outcomes and a lack of learning opportunities for future outbreaks. The proposed solution aims to address this issue by providing a pre-designed, well-vetted trial design that can be quickly implemented during an epidemic.\n\nThis approach would not only improve treatment for the United States but also contribute to global health efforts by providing valuable data on effective treatments for acute infectious diseases. Anticipation and order are crucial antidotes to fear, and this proposal aims to instill those qualities in the face of future epidemics.\n\nIn conclusion, the call for a pre-designed randomized clinical trial for acute infectious diseases is a timely and necessary response to the challenges posed by epidemics. By preparing for the next outbreak, we can ensure that we are not only learning from each epidemic but also continuously improving our treatment approaches.",
    " Title: Debris Found in Mediterranean Sea: EgyptAir Flight MS804 Disappearance Update\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the mysterious disappearance of EgyptAir flight MS804, debris, including a \"body part,\" two seats, and suitcases, has been found in the Mediterranean Sea, according to Egyptian authorities. The plane, carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew members, vanished from radar screens about 45 minutes before it was due to land in Cairo on Thursday morning.\n\nThe aircraft, an Airbus A320, was traveling at an altitude of 11,000 meters (37,000ft) when it disappeared approximately 175 miles from the Egyptian coast. The plane had departed from Paris at 11.09pm on Wednesday (21.09 GMT/07.09am Thursday AEST) and disappeared at 2.30am Paris time.\n\nThe plane had passed through airports in Tunisia and Eritrea during its four journeys on Wednesday before the Paris-Cairo flight, but no warning flags were raised. EgyptAir's vice-chairman, Ahmed Abdel, stated that there were \"no reported snags\" from the crew in Cairo or Paris, nor was there any special cargo or notification of dangerous goods on board.\n\nThe area where the plane went down is heavily trafficked and monitored, with British listening posts in Cyprus, close to Israel, and near the US Sixth Fleet. Egyptian army spokesman says searches are continuing in the area where the debris was found, with a major international air and sea operation underway to find the aircraft's two black box flight recorders, which might hold the key to understanding the incident.\n\nThe water in the search area can be 2,000 meters (6,500ft) deep, and the equipment involved in the search for MH370 is able to search depths of at least 6,000 meters. If the EgyptAir A320 is similar to the Germanwings model that crashed last year, it will have two recording components: a cockpit voice recorder, which tapes what the pilots say, and a flight data recorder, which stores some of the 2,500 technical measurements in a modern aircraft.\n\nGreece's lead air accident investigator, Athanasios Binis, stated, \"The most important thing is that the plane's two black boxes are found. If the cockpit flight recorder and flight data recorder are found, along with wreckage, then a real investigation can begin.\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, various theories regarding the cause of the incident are being considered, with no definitive conclusion reached as of yet. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande stated, \"We have a duty to know everything about the cause and what has happened. No theory is ruled out and none is certain right now.\"\n\nEgypt's aviation minister, Sherif Fathy, has suggested that the sudden disappearance of the plane was more likely caused by a terrorist attack than technical failure. However, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault stated on Friday that there was \"absolutely no indication\" of why the flight came down.\n\nThe search for answers continues as the international community works together to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of EgyptAir flight MS804.",
    " Title: Nike's Controversial Decision to Pull Betsy Ross Flag-Themed Shoe Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and debate, Nike has decided to pull a Fourth of July-themed sneaker featuring the Betsy Ross flag. The decision, made at the request of Colin Kaepernick, former NFL football player and current Nike representative, has led to a heated discussion about the symbolism of the flag and its historical context.\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag, a 13-star flag associated with the American Revolution, has been at the center of the controversy. Some argue that the flag, which was designed during a time of slaveholding, has been co-opted by white supremacists and should not be used as a symbol of American patriotism.\n\nOthers, however, argue that the flag is not a symbol of white nationalism, but rather a symbol of American history and independence. They argue that it is wrong to cede national or civic symbols to racists, as it allows them to present their ideology as \"patriotic\" and what America should be.\n\nIt is worth noting that the historical accuracy of Betsy Ross's role in designing the flag is a matter of dispute. The Washington Post reports that there is little evidence to back up assertions by her descendants that turned the Philadelphia-based upholsterer into a national heroine in the 1870s.\n\nThe decision to pull the shoes has led to a backlash, particularly among those on the right. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey has announced that he is canceling incentives the state had offered Nike to build a plant there.\n\nThe controversy has led to a broader discussion about the role of historical symbols in contemporary society and the importance of understanding their historical context. As the nation celebrates its independence, the debate over the Betsy Ross flag serves as a reminder of the complex and often controversial history of the United States.",
    " Title: Ben Carson Accuses CNN of 'Smear Campaign' Over Inquiry into His Past Violent Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated interview on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson repeatedly criticized recent inquiries into his violent childhood, labeling them as a \"smear campaign.\" The interview, which lasted nearly 30 minutes, saw Carson engaging in a heated exchange with host Alisyn Camerota over CNN's report that it was unable to corroborate any of Carson's past accounts, including claims he once punched a classmate and stabbed another.\n\nAccording to CNN, at least nine of Carson's childhood classmates had no recollection of events as described by Carson. When Camerota asked Carson about CNN's report, a visibly frustrated Carson raised his voice, stating, \"This is a bunch of lies attempting to say I'm lying about my history, I think it's pathetic.\"\n\nCamerota pressed Carson about specific discrepancies, namely why the CNN reporters who traveled to Detroit were unable to identify any of his past victims. Carson explained that the names he used were fictitious to protect the individuals' privacy. He insisted that the young man he stabbed does indeed exist and that he had spoken to him the previous day.\n\nCarson faced further questioning over his changing story, with Camerota pointing out discrepancies in the name and relation of the young man he claimed to have stabbed as an adolescent. Carson maintained that the young man he stabbed does exist and that he had spoken to him.\n\nCarson also faced questions about a 2014 speech in which he stated, \"We'd be Cuba if there were no Fox News,\" and joked that some Americans are \"stupid.\" When asked to clarify which Americans he was describing as \"stupid,\" Carson became defensive and refused to provide a clear answer.\n\nThe interview ended on a contentious note, with Carson accusing Camerota of trying to put words into his mouth and questioning her integrity and intelligence. Immediately after the interview, Carson appeared on Breitbart News' Sirius XM radio program to continue his attack on the media.\n\nCNN is \"coming from a place of falsehood,\" Carson said, while he claimed to be \"coming from a place of truth.\" Carson vowed to \"fight CNN tooth and nail\" and asserted that \"truth always wins.\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Faces Questions on Women's March Anti-Semitism Allegations, Avoids Direct Response\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a demonstration with a Women's March group near Central Park, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was confronted by a CNN reporter regarding the growing allegations of anti-Semitism within the Women's March movement. The reporter questioned Ocasio-Cortez about her continued support for the organization amidst these allegations.\n\nThe allegations, which include support for Louis Farrakhan, the removal of Jewish leaders, and co-president Tamika Mallory's refusal to affirm Israel's right to exist, have led numerous supporters to distance themselves from the organization, including the Democratic National Committee and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).\n\nIn response to the questions, Ocasio-Cortez did not directly address the allegations against the Women's March movement. Instead, she shifted the focus to concerns of anti-Semitism within the current administration, stating, \"I think that right now, in this moment in the United States, we have to center this conversation. I think that concerns of anti-Semitism with the current administration in the White House are absolutely valid, and we need to make sure that we are protecting the Jewish community and all those that feel vulnerable in this moment.\"\n\nIn another instance, right-wing activist Laura Loomer confronted Ocasio-Cortez, asking, \"Why are you standing with people who openly support Hamas, a terrorist organization that kills Jewish people?\" Ocasio-Cortez did not respond directly to Loomer's question.\n\nThe Women's March movement has been under scrutiny for its perceived anti-Semitic actions and statements, and the ongoing allegations have led to a significant rift within the progressive movement. Ocasio-Cortez's response to these allegations has sparked debate among political pundits and the public.",
    " Title: Trump Establishes White House Faith-Based Initiative to Protect Religious Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In observance of the National Day of Prayer, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, establishing a new White House faith-based initiative aimed at safeguarding religious freedom.\n\nAddressing faith leaders in the White House Rose Garden, Trump emphasized, \"As president, I will always protect religious liberty. Prayer has always been the cornerstone of American life. It has forged the identity and destiny of this great nation that we all love.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence, in his remarks, stated, \"The American people believe in prayer.\" He added, \"The greatest words the president and I ever hear is, 'I'm praying for you.'\"\n\nTrump's faith initiative seeks to enable individuals to exercise their beliefs freely and provide faith-based organizations with equal access to government funding. The order calls for the executive branch to ensure \"conscience protections\" that allow people and institutions to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation from the federal government.\n\nThe order states, \"It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\" It also directs the Treasury Department to refrain from targeting churches or religious groups for speaking about political issues.\n\nThe White House faith-based initiative has received positive reactions from Christian leaders. Evangelist Franklin Graham expressed his gratitude, stating, \"I'm extremely grateful that we have a president who realizes the importance of prayer, faith, and religious freedoms to our nation.\"\n\nJohnnie Moore, an unofficial spokesman for the president's faith advisors, praised the move, saying, \"This executive order is the product of the President's unwavering prioritization of faith and religious liberty and reflects the smart work of people like Jared Kushner and advisors in the policy and public liaison divisions who met with hundreds and hundreds of leaders and government officials to assess ways in which the government can partner more effectively with communities of faith.\"\n\nMoore also highlighted the importance of having a faith-based liaison directly associated with the White House. He suggested that the White House faith-based effort should focus on issues like prison reform, mental health, strengthening families, promoting education, and meeting humanitarian needs.\n\nCalifornia pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie also commended Trump's latest pro-faith move, stating, \"I've always believed that America is better when it's faithful. Anything any administration can do to demonstrate a positive partnership between our faith communities and government, the better off our country will be, and so I herald this important initiative that empowers people of faith in America.\"\n\nHowever, author and former Obama White House staffer Michael Wear, while praising the initiative, expressed caution, stating, \"It remains to be seen whether this Administration is truly interested in building an initiative that is focused on helping diverse faith communities serve those in need, or if the real value they see is in using the office as a platform where elite political supporters can pose as statesmen.\"\n\nThe White House Office of Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships was initiated by President George W. Bush in 2001. Under President Barack Obama, Joshua DuBois established an advisory council where members were appointed to one-year terms. The National Day of Prayer is held on the first Thursday of May, and this year's theme is \"unity in America.\"",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Accuses Hillary Clinton of Defamation Over 'Russian Asset' Claim, Demands Apology and Retraction\n\nIn a move that has escalated the ongoing political tensions between two prominent Democratic figures, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of defamation over a statement that implied Gabbard was a Russian asset. The Gabbard campaign's legal counsel has sent a letter to Clinton demanding a retraction and an apology for the allegedly false and defamatory statement.\n\nThe letter, sent in response to Clinton's comments on a podcast on October 17, states that Gabbard is not a Russian asset and that Clinton knew the statement was false when she made it. The letter further asserts that no law enforcement or intelligence agencies have claimed or presented any evidence that Gabbard is a Russian asset.\n\nClinton's original statement, made during a conversation with David Plouffe on Campaign HQ, suggested that Gabbard was being groomed by Russians to be a third-party candidate. However, early reports about Clinton's comments indicated that she meant Gabbard was being groomed by Republicans, not Russians. The Gabbard campaign's letter accuses Clinton of putting a \"spin\" on the statement to avoid liability.\n\nThe letter also highlights Gabbard's patriotism, stating that she is a sitting four-term United States Congresswoman and a Major in the United States Army National Guard. Gabbard has gone on record stating she has no intention of running as a third-party candidate if she fails to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe letter concludes by proposing a statement for Clinton to post on her Twitter account and send to major media outlets, in which she would admit that she was wrong, made a grave mistake and error in judgment, and express support and admiration for Gabbard's work. The letter also demands that Clinton hold a press conference to make a verbal retraction of her past statement.\n\nFox News reached out to the Gabbard campaign for comment on whether the congresswoman intends to sue if Clinton does not meet these demands, but they did not immediately respond. This development adds another layer of intrigue to the 2020 Democratic primary race, as Gabbard continues to push back against Clinton's allegations and seeks a public apology and retraction.",
    " Title: Trump to Sign Executive Order Imposing Sanctions on Foreign Entities Interfering in U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order on Wednesday, which will impose sanctions on foreign companies or individuals found to be interfering in U.S. elections, based on intelligence agency findings, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe move comes as intelligence agencies, military, and law enforcement prepare to defend the upcoming November 6 congressional elections from predicted foreign attacks. The order is the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to address election security before the voting that will determine whether the Republican Party can maintain its majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nThe executive order will empower a range of agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Homeland Security Department, to decide if election interference has occurred. Election interference will be defined as hacking attempts against \"election infrastructure\" and efforts to sway public opinion through coordinated digital propaganda or systematic leaks of private political information.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have found that Russian hackers breached the Democratic National Committee and leaked confidential information during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal previously reported on earlier drafts of the executive order.\n\nCongress has been purposefully left out of the executive order drafting process, the official said, as the administration wants to preempt legislation being considered in the House and Senate that addresses similar issues. U.S. lawmakers have introduced various pieces of Russia-related legislation, including the \"Deter Act\" and a sanctions bill aimed at punishing Moscow for cybercrime and its activities in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have criticized Trump's perceived weak stance on accusations of Russian interference in 2016, following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in July. Trump's acceptance of Putin's denials over the word of his own intelligence agencies drew widespread criticism.\n\nCongress passed a Russia sanctions bill more than a year ago. Some lawmakers, including some Republicans as well as Democrats, have expressed frustration with what they see as the administration's reluctance to implement the bill. Trump signed the bill only after Congress passed it with overwhelming majorities. Acting on that law, the U.S. Treasury imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians, striking at allies of Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow.",
    " Title: \"Bipartisan Call for Civil Discourse: A Shift Towards Finding Common Ground in a Polarized America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a deeply divided political climate, a growing movement is emerging, calling for a shift towards civil discourse and finding common ground. This movement, driven by individuals from across the political spectrum, is a response to the increasing polarization and toxicity that has permeated American public discourse.\n\nRecent polls indicate that conversations about contentious political issues, such as the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, are surprisingly civil, with over three quarters of Americans reporting civil discussions with friends and family. However, this contrasts starkly with an annual poll tracking discourse in the United States, where 93 percent of Americans think the U.S. has a civility problem.\n\nThe Kavanaugh hearings, the Virginia Senate race, and exchanges between members of Congress have highlighted the depth of the problem. In the Virginia Senate race, a Republican challenger pledged a \"vicious, ruthless campaign\" to unseat the Democrat incumbent, implying without evidence that his opponent had committed sexual assault. A Democratic representative from California warned members of Donald Trump's Cabinet to expect heckling and public shaming if they continue to support the president's policy on undocumented immigrants.\n\nNotables from across the political spectrum are sounding the alarm, warning of the perils of the current path. Michelle Obama, in a recent speech at a voter registration rally in Las Vegas, expressed her dismay at the \"nastiness of our politics.\" Senator Jeff Flake, during the Kavanaugh hearings, lamented the impact of tribalism, stating that it is \"tearing our country apart.\"\n\nTo address this issue, individuals are encouraged to adopt a mindset that values inclusivity, open-mindedness, and understanding. This shift in mindset involves accepting the fundamental truth that including more than one view contributes to a stronger position and a better, more effective solution. It also involves being open-minded to facts that might conflict with our narrative, listening to others without rushing to judgement, and seeking to understand why those we disagree with hold the views they do.\n\nWith midterm elections rapidly approaching, citizens are urged to cast ballots for candidates with strong track records of working with those with different political views. Regardless of their party, choose candidates who speak out against the speech and policies designed to divide us.\n\nOrganizations such as the Common Ground Committee, Living Room Conversations, Better Angels, and The Bridge Alliance are working to remove the threat of toxic polarization and promote civil dialogue. These organizations inspire action on polarizing issues by bringing prominent leaders with opposing views together in public forums to find common ground.\n\nFor instance, after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Donna Brazile (former interim DNC chairwoman) and Michael Steele (former RNC chairman) participated in a Common Ground Committee public forum to discuss government's role in bridging racial divides. Despite their disagreements on issues such as racial profiling and affirmative action, they found common ground on the need for police to live in the communities they serve, election funding transparency, and that voting districts should be drawn by citizens' commissions, not politicians.\n\nThe movement for civil discourse, finding common ground, and focusing on solutions rather than arguments is growing. By demonstrating the value and power of civil discourse, we can shift the cultural norm from winning at all costs to finding common ground whenever possible. This shift will allow our leaders to make progress quicker and more frequently on the issues that matter.\n\nBruce Bond, a 30-year veteran of the information technology industry, is the co-founder of the Common Ground Committee, a citizen-led initiative focused on demonstrating productive public discourse. The nonprofit's next public forums will seek common ground on gun control, immigration, and the press.",
    " Title: Majority of Voters Favor Obamacare Repeal, Poll Reveals; Cost Concerns Prevalent\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll has revealed that more than half of voters would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, if given the chance. The survey, conducted by Fox News, found that 53% of respondents would vote to repeal the law, while 40% would vote to keep it.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,017 registered voters nationwide from July 21-23, also found that 47% of respondents believe Obamacare will cost their family more money, with 34% stating their healthcare costs would remain the same.\n\nThe expectation of increased healthcare costs comes at a time when 63% of the public is unhappy with the current state of the country, and 57% say they have seen no signs of economic recovery.\n\nBreaking down the poll respondents by party, 70% of Republicans believe Obamacare will cost them more, while 21% of Democrats believe it will save them money. A large percentage of Republicans, 85%, and 65% of independents also want the law repealed, compared to 72% of Democrats who said it's worth keeping.\n\nThe survey also addressed the White House's decision to delay the employer mandate on coverage for a year. Forty-five percent of respondents overall found this decision unacceptable, while 46% described it as no big deal. Seventy-one percent of Democrats said they were fine with the decision, while 68% of Republicans and 55% of independents disagreed with the decision to delay.\n\nLastly, survey participants were asked if the \"Medical Loss Ratio\" portion of the healthcare law had returned any savings to them in refunds of some of their premium costs.

This move escalates the Trump administration's legal battle against the health care law.\n\nInitially, the DOJ argued in court that the ACA's pre-existing condition protections should be struck down. Now, the administration argues that the entire law should be invalidated. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled in December that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional, and the rest of the law is therefore invalid.\n\nIn a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit on Monday, the DOJ stated, \"The Department of Justice has determined that the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.\"\n\nThis decision is likely to prompt renewed criticism from Democrats, who had already criticized the Trump administration's earlier stance on pre-existing condition protections. This issue was a significant point of contention in the 2018 midterm elections, with many Republican candidates in tight races grappling with whether to align with the Trump administration's position.\n\nLegal experts from both parties suggest that the lawsuit, which was filed by 20 GOP-led states, may not ultimately prevail. Judge O'Connor, who ruled against the law in December, is known for his conservative leanings.\n\nThe case hinges on the argument that since Congress repealed the tax penalty in the ACA's individual mandate in 2017, the mandate can no longer be considered constitutional under Congress's power to tax. The challengers then argue that the entire ACA should be invalidated because the mandate is unconstitutional.\n\nMost legal experts contend that, even if the mandate is ruled unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA should remain intact, as that is what Congress voted to do in the 2017 tax law that repealed the mandate's penalty.

    " Title: Tulsa Police Officer Acquitted in Shooting Death of Terence Crutcher\n\nArticle:\n\nOn September 16, 2016, Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old motorist, was shot and killed by police officer Betty Jo Shelby in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The shooting, which took place on 36th Street North and Lewis Avenue, was captured in aerial footage taken by the Tulsa police department.\n\nCrutcher, who was unarmed during the encounter, was standing near his vehicle in the middle of the street when he was shot. The shooting led to protests in Tulsa, and on September 22, the Tulsa County District Attorney charged Shelby with first-degree manslaughter after the shooting was labeled a homicide. On May 17, 2017, a jury found her not guilty of first-degree manslaughter.\n\nTerence Crutcher was a 40-year-old black man who was described by his sister as a father and a student at Tulsa Community College. He was also involved in his church and sang in the choir. The officers involved in the incident were Betty Shelby and Tyler Turnbough, both of whom are white.\n\nAt 7:36 p.m. on September 16, 2016, police received a 9-1-1 call about an abandoned vehicle in the middle of 36th Street North just west of Lewis Avenue. One caller said that the vehicle was blocking traffic, and another said that there was a car that looked like somebody just jumped out of it and left it in the center of the road.\n\nPolice stated that Crutcher kept reaching into his pocket, refused to show his hands, walked towards his vehicle despite being told to stop, and then angled towards and reached into his vehicle. Critics have disputed this, saying that the driver's side window was up when Crutcher was shot. Turnbough tased Crutcher, and Shelby shot him.\n\nApproximately two minutes after the shot, an officer checked Crutcher's pockets, and approximately 45 seconds later, someone crouched to offer aid. Police said Crutcher died in the hospital later that day. Tulsa police chief Chuck Jordan said no weapon was recovered from Crutcher's body or vehicle.\n\nPolice dashcam and helicopter video as well as the dispatch audio were released by police on September 19, 2016. Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan called the video \"disturbing\" and \"difficult to watch.\" The officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nCrutcher's sister said at a press conference, \"You all want to know who that big, bad dude was? That big, bad dude was my twin brother. That big, bad dude was a father. That big, bad dude was a son. That big, bad dude was enrolled at Tulsa Community College\u2014just wanting to make us proud. That big, bad dude loved God. That big, bad dude was at church, singing, with all his flaws, every week.\"\n\nThe Tulsa Police Department started a criminal investigation of the shooting. Homicide Sergeant Dave Walker stated that PCP had been recovered from Crutcher's car. Shelby's attorney had previously stated that she thought Crutcher might be under the influence of PCP based on what she learned during her drug-recognition training. Crutcher's father had stated in a 2012 affidavit that his son had a history of PCP use.\n\nAutopsy results released by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner indicated that Terence Crutcher had \"acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication\" at the time of the shooting. The report also indicated that tenocyclidine (TCP), a psychostimulant and hallucinogen which is more potent than PCP, was present.\n\nCriminal charges, trial, and acquittal of police officer\n\nTulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Shelby with first-degree manslaughter. Shelby turned herself in at the Tulsa County Jail on the early morning of September 23, where she was booked and was shortly released after posting a bond of $50,000. Shelby was accused of \"unlawfully and unnecessarily\" shooting Crutcher. On May 17, 2017, a jury found Betty Shelby not guilty. Betty Shelby then later quit the Tulsa Police Department and became a Rogers County, Oklahoma Sheriff's Deputy.",
    " Title: Identity Politics Divide: A Threat to the College Experience and American Values\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the commencement season, young people across the nation celebrate the completion of their college careers, marking the transition from academic institutions into the adult world. However, the camaraderie inherent in the college experience is under threat, as identity politics, a divisive tool, is creating divisions in the very environment that is meant to broaden one's worldview and foster a sense of belonging.\n\nCollege is intended to serve as a stepping stone into adulthood, a journey that involves leaving the comfort of one's home and venturing into an arena filled with individuals different from oneself. The intention is not only to acquire knowledge from textbooks but also to expand one's understanding of the world beyond oneself.\n\nRecently, there has been a concerning trend emerging in American academia. The National Association of Scholars has reported that at least 75 American colleges host black-only graduation ceremonies, and 43 percent of surveyed colleges offer segregated residential halls. This phenomenon, referred to as 'neo-segregation,' is a cause for concern.\n\nIn 2017, Harvard University held a separate commencement ceremony for African American graduates, which made national headlines. The New York Times reported that the event was Harvard's first commencement for black graduate students, and many speakers discussed the unique struggles faced by black students at the Ivy League university. This event followed the traditional end-of-year ceremony that had taken place two days earlier.\n\nIn the same year, an organizer of Harvard's separate graduation ceremony told The Associated Press, \"We really wanted an opportunity to give voice to the voiceless at Harvard. So many students identify with the African diaspora but don't necessarily feel welcome as part of the larger community, and they don't feel like their stories are being shared.\"\n\nThe argument for these separate events is that the Ivy League university does not accept these students and has racial issues. The answer, according to proponents of these events, is a segregated commencement ceremony, as students are leaving the university, reinforcing the perception that they are not accepted.\n\nIn any institution involving thousands of people, there will be aspects of racism, sexism, and homophobia. The value of a diverse community lies in confronting and challenging these issues as part of that community.\n\nThose who laud the separate-but-equal commencement events argue that college students have always associated based on interest and affinities. This is true; there are debate clubs, political science societies, drama leagues, language clubs, etc. In some campus housing, one finds people choosing floors that also reflect similar interests, such as language, math, art history, engineering, or architecture.\n\nComing together in association based on intellectual affinity transcends political partisanship, race, sex, and gender. These leagues are based on ideas and interests, not on slivers of our identities and therefore do not require the exclusion of people because of what they look like or who they love.\n\nWard Connerly, president of the American Civil Rights Institute and a former University of California regent, explained to The Times that events like black commencements \"serve only to 'amplify' racial differences. 'College is the place where we should be teaching and preaching the view that you're an individual, and choose your associates to be based on other factors rather than skin color,' he said.\"\n\nThe left's obsession with identity politics requires division and otherness; it is a premise that views people unlike oneself as unknowable and unrelatable, and therefore that one is unknowable and relatable.\n\nEmpathy and common experiences, in these cases, of being a student at Harvard, are what would normally bring people together. Differences in life experience, home life, and interests make friendships and relationships even more interesting and valuable.\n\nThis is how people's lives and points of view are changed and improved. This is how communities are built and thrive. And it is exactly what threatens the reliance on division, suspicion, and hate that the left relies on to organize and control people.\n\nThe heart of the American experience, relationships, empathy, and understanding, and becoming united with people unlike oneself, is the existential threat to the left and to their political narrative, and it is why the left remains obsessed with conditioning people into accepting the dangerous fraud of identity politics.",
    " Title: Obama Stresses Iraqi Political Action as Key to Defeating Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, President Barack Obama reiterated his stance that the United States has yet to develop a comprehensive strategy for defeating the Islamic State (IS). However, he offered insights into his reasoning, suggesting that the U.S. is withholding its commitments to Iraq to pressure the Iraqi government to take the necessary political steps for an anti-IS strategy to succeed.\n\n\"A complete strategy,\" Mr. Obama said, \"requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well.\" He emphasized the need for the Iraqi government to establish mechanisms for recruitment and training of IS members, as well as the creation of an \"inclusive\" government that serves Iraq's Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd communities equally.\n\nDuring the day, the president met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who was invited to the Group of Seven industrialized Western countries' summit to discuss the anti-IS battle and present his case for more international assistance.\n\nObama highlighted the Iraqi government's reluctance to enlist and arm Sunnis in the country's security forces as a significant impediment to a successful campaign against IS. He noted that, at present, there is more training capacity in Iraq than recruits willing to be trained.\n\nThe U.S. has encouraged Iraq to create a national guard to facilitate the creation of local security forces and the arming of Sunni tribes, but legislation to this effect has stalled for months.\n\nPresident Obama did not absolve the U.S. and other countries of responsibility for the setbacks Iraq has experienced in the fight against IS. He particularly criticized neighboring and Western countries for failing to stem the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe international effort to address the influx of foreign fighters seeking to fight for IS, a effort Obama launched last September with a special session of the United Nations Security Council, has \"made some progress, but not enough,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. and European countries have to do a better job of stopping their citizens who aim to join the ranks of IS, but Obama also singled out Turkey for failing to adequately control its border with Syria, the border most foreign fighters cross to join IS.\n\n\"If we can cut off some of that foreign fighter flow, then we are able to isolate and wear out ISIL forces that are already there,\" Obama said, using the acronym for IS that the U.S. government prefers. \"We are taking a lot of them off the battlefield,\" he added, \"but if they\u2019re being replenished, then it doesn\u2019t solve the problem over the long term.\"\n\nObama made the \"no complete strategy\" comment last August, when he said the administration had to consult with Congress and foreign partners before formulating a plan to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" IS.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse,\" he said then. \"We don\u2019t have a strategy yet.\"\n\nObama's suggestion that the formulation of a \"complete strategy\" is being held up, at least to some degree, by a lack of Iraqi political action does not appear to have satisfied all the president's critics.\n\n\"What has President Obama been doing for 10 months?\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said in response to the president's comments. \"Nearly a year after first saying he didn\u2019t have a strategy to combat ISIS, President Obama again today said there is still not a complete strategy to take on the terrorist group.\"\n\nHowever, some regional analysts interpreted Obama's comment as a warning to the Iraqi government, particularly Prime Minister Abadi, that receiving stepped-up assistance depends on their political actions.\n\n\"This was very definitely aimed at Abadi and the Iraqis,\" says Lawrence Korb, a senior national security fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington and a former Pentagon official. \"It was meant to send him a message to get going and do some of the things we think are holding up progress\" against IS.\n\nThe White House sees in Abadi \"a more inclusive leader\" than Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite hard-liner he replaced, but has since realized that Abadi is either unwilling or politically unable to draw in a suspicious Sunni community, Mr. Korb says.",
    " Title: Biden's Controversial Remarks on English Jurisprudence at Biden Courage Awards\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Biden Courage Awards ceremony, a prelude to his presidential campaign launch. In an attempt to address claims that his candidacy might lack intersectional appeal in the Democratic primaries, Biden criticized a central pillar of Western civilization, claiming it as inherently racist.\n\n\"Back in the late 1300s, so many women were dying at the hands of their husbands because they were chattel, just like the cattle or the sheep, that the court of common law decided they had to do something about the extent of the deaths,\" Biden said, in what has since been criticized as historically inaccurate. \"So you know what they said? No man has a right to chastise his woman with a rod thicker than the circumference of his thumb. This is English jurisprudential culture, a white man's culture. It's got to change. It's got to change.\"\n\nBiden's statement, as always, has been met with criticism for its historical inaccuracy. The \"rule of thumb\" story, as feminist scholar Christina Hoff Sommers points out, is a myth. \"On the contrary,\" she writes, \"British law since the 1700s and our American laws predating the Revolution prohibit wife beating.\" In reality, the phrase originated in craftsmen so skilled that they could perform tasks without precise measuring tools.\n\nMoreover, Biden's characterization of \"English jurisprudential culture\" as \"white man's culture\" is deeply troubling. English jurisprudential culture is rooted in the belief in the rule of law, due process of law, and equal rights under law; English jurisprudential culture is responsible for preserving the natural rights we hold dear, rights which were imperfectly but increasingly extended over time to more and more human beings, particularly minorities.\n\nNo less a leftist figure than Barack Obama explained this in 2009, stating he sought a system at Guantanamo Bay that \"adheres to the rule of law, habeas corpus, basic principles of Anglo-American legal system.\" Protection of individual rights\u2014and in particular, minority rights\u2014lies at the heart of English jurisprudence.\n\nYet Biden boiled down those rights to racial privilege. And the attempt to reduce the fundamental principles of our civilization to a mask for racial hierarchical power is both false and frightening. It suggests that those principles ought to be undermined for purposes of disestablishing that supposed hierarchy. Get rid of English jurisprudential law, presumably, in order to fight racism.\n\nIronically, the reduction of Western civilization to racial supremacy is not just a strategy of the intersectional left; it's a strategy of the despicable alt-right, which champions Western civilization as white civilization and then seeks to rip away the universalism of its principles from nonwhite people. Thus, the very term \"Western civilization\" is under assault by a variety of political forces seeking to tear out eternal truths and natural rights in the name of tribalism.\n\nBut that's not what Western civilization is about at all. Western civilization was built on Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason, culminating in a perspective on natural rights that is preserved by institutions like English jurisprudence. It is thanks to those philosophical principles that free markets, free speech, and free association have grown and flourished. Only if we re-enshrine those principles, rather than undermine them, will our prosperity and freedoms be preserved.",
    " Title: \"Examining the Rise and Controversy Surrounding U.S. Veterans' Disability Compensation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the system of disability payments for veterans has seen a significant increase in both the average payout and the number of recipients over the past two decades. These payments, distinct from medical costs associated with treating an injury, are designed to compensate veterans for an assumed inability to work. Since 2000, the average payout has risen 60 percent (inflation-adjusted), and the proportion of veterans receiving some form of compensation has nearly doubled.\n\nWhile the majority of veterans who receive these disability checks are genuinely in need, there is a growing concern that the system can be manipulated. Claiming the right combination of symptoms, whether one is genuinely suffering or not, can increase the likelihood of receiving a monthly, tax-free, disability check for life. There are even blogs that guide individuals through the process of claiming an injury that cannot be disproved.\n\nPersonal anecdotes highlight the ease with which some veterans can receive these payments. One such example involves a veteran who, upon leaving the Navy in 2005, filled out a form and underwent a medical exam to document a fractured shoulder sustained in the line of duty. Soon after, this individual received a rating and their first monthly direct-deposit payment. Despite feeling no entitlement to anything other than medical care, attempts to discontinue the payment were met with the revelation that there was no process for doing so. The veteran's ability to hold a full-time job had no bearing on their disability rating.\n\nAs a nation, we have a solemn duty to care for those who have fought our battles. However, the current disability-compensation regime warrants scrutiny, not only for financial prudence but also to avoid fostering a culture of dependency. A recent study by Mark Duggan, an economist at Stanford, has linked rising disability payments to increased unemployment among veterans. The author suggests that such payments may reduce the \"recipient's propensity to work\" because disability checks obviate the need for a job.\n\nThis issue underscores the importance of striking a balance between providing for our veterans and ensuring the sustainability of the system. It is crucial to maintain the support for those who have sacrificed for our country, while also encouraging self-sufficiency and employment among veterans.",
    " Title: The Shift in GOP's Free Trade Stance: A Closer Look at the Trump Effect\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party, traditionally known for its adherence to free market principles, is facing scrutiny as it appears to be abandoning its long-standing commitment to free trade. The shift, particularly noticeable during the Trump presidency, has raised questions about the party's dedication to fiscal responsibility and economic liberalization.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, the constant criticism of trade and trade agreements by then-candidate Donald Trump seemed to influence other Republican candidates, such as Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, to advocate for \"fair\" trade, a term often associated with protectionism.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has pursued a comprehensive protectionist agenda, threatening foreign governments with a multi-front trade war, which he claims will be easy to win. Most recently, Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from countries including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, potentially followed by tariffs on automobiles. The justification for these actions is that imports of steel and aluminum, and automobiles, from these countries \"threaten to impair the national security\" of the United States. This statement disregards the fact that six of the top 10 providers of steel to the U.S. are NATO allies and closest friends.\n\nIn the face of a diplomatic backlash and a likely negative economic impact, the Republican-controlled Congress has been largely inactive. This inaction is not due to a lack of power, but rather a lack of political will. Beyond condemning the president's erratic and counterproductive actions, they could pass legislation to reverse the imposition of tariffs or reclaim some of the authority they delegated to the president to impose tariffs, as a few, including Sens. Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, have suggested.\n\nRecent comments by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who argued that tariffs on European and Canadian imports are a means of \"standing up for the process,\" have been met with skepticism. McCarthy's assertion that imposing tariffs is an effective way to persuade other countries to lower their own tariffs is questionable. The United States' historical approach to free trade has been through decisive pro-free trade policies, not protectionism.\n\nMcCarthy's claim that these tariffs will punish foreign governments for their protectionist tendencies is also misleading. The additional cost of tariffs on steel will make it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete with foreign manufacturers who produce goods without the added cost of tariffs. This will result in lost U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\nMcCarthy's assertion that the Trump administration is \"standing up for the process\" through tariffs is further questioned by the national security argument, which is deemed bogus when levying tariffs against NATO allies. In fact, during a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation, the Department of Defense wrote a letter stating that no tariffs were needed to protect national security, as the DOD's military needs are fulfilled by only 3% of the domestic steel production.\n\nThe dangers of Trump's move will become apparent when those former allies drag the U.S.'s protectionist leaders before the World Trade Organization and the U.S. loses, as experts predict. Many have long surmised that the Republican Party stands for little more than low taxes, but at least it used to show some sort of commitment to free trade. Not anymore.",
    " Title: Compassion and Border Control: A Delicate Balance in U.S. Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Trump administration grapples with the fallout from its \"zero-tolerance\" policy on illegal border crossings, a growing chorus of criticism is emerging from both political sides, highlighting the delicate balance between border security and humanitarian concerns.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) provided a poignant example of the rhetorical challenges facing the administration. \"Ripping children out of their parents' arms to inflict harm on the child to influence the parents is unacceptable,\" said Merkley.\n\nFormer First Lady Laura Bush also weighed in, describing the policy as \"cruel\" in a Washington Post column. Current First Lady Melania Trump, too, expressed her disapproval, stating in a formal statement that she \"hates to see children separated from their families\" and urged \"successful immigration reform.\"\n\nThe policy, which has been widely criticized for its harsh treatment of migrant families, has sparked a national debate about the role of compassion in immigration policy. The issue is complex, with valid arguments on both sides of the aisle.\n\nIt is important to note that an illegal entrant into the United States brings no inherent rights with them. They are, in essence, petitioners, relying on the kindness of strangers. Kindness, as a human virtue, is a powerful force, but it is not always the most practical solution when it comes to governing a nation of over 326 million people.\n\nThe enforcement of immigration laws is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the nation's borders. However, the manner in which these laws are enforced must be guided by a common appreciation of the inherent worth of all individuals. The current policy, with its focus on deterrence, has been widely criticized for its lack of compassion and its potential long-term consequences for the children affected.\n\nThe sympathies of the American public are understandably divided. On one hand, there is a deep concern for the plight of children separated from their families. On the other, there is a need for strong and effective border control to maintain the safety and security of the nation.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is clear that a compromise solution is needed. Both parties must find a way to address the need for strong border control while also ensuring the humane treatment of migrants, particularly children. This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a willingness to find common ground.\n\nIn the end, the goal should be to create a nation that is both secure and compassionate, one that upholds the rule of law while also treating all individuals with dignity and respect. This is a challenge that requires the best efforts of both political parties, and it is one that will shape the future of our nation for years to come.",
    " Title: \"2020 Election: Democrats Show Strong Fundraising and Polling Advantage Over Republicans\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWith less than 100 days remaining before the 2020 presidential election, recent polls and fundraising data suggest a potential disastrous outcome for the Republican party.\n\nIn a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, only 38% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while 60% disapprove. This is a significant drop from March, when 51% approved of Trump's handling of the pandemic and 45% disapproved in the same poll.\n\nThe shift in public opinion towards Trump's handling of the pandemic has also translated into a significant advantage for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in general election polling. According to two new national polls released this week, Biden leads Trump by 15 and 11 points.\n\nIn addition to the presidential race, Democrats also hold a double-digit lead in party identification. A new Gallup poll shows that 50% of Americans identify as Democrats or Democratic leaners, while 39% describe themselves as Republicans or Republican leaners. This is a significant shift from January, when Republicans had a 47% to 45% edge on party ID in Gallup polling.\n\nThe fundraising numbers also tell a similar story. According to the Wall Street Journal, Democratic candidates in the 11 most competitive Senate contests in the country raised a collective $67.3 million between April 1 and June 30, compared to $46.8 million for their Republican counterparts. The story is the same in the House, where Democratic candidates raised $457 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $365 million for Republican candidates.\n\nThe fundraising difference is even larger in swing districts currently held by well-funded Democratic incumbents. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 13 races holding primaries in June and July that are considered competitive by the Cook Political Report, incumbent Democrats have 9 times more money in the bank than the best-funded Republican challengers.\n\nThe Cook Political Report moved 20 House races in favor of Democrats on Friday, an unprecedented shift to one party. House editor David Wasserman wrote that \"President Trump's abysmal polling since the pandemic began is seriously jeopardizing down-ballot GOP fortunes.\"\n\nRepublicans began the cycle hoping to pick up 18 seats to win the majority back, but they are now just trying to avoid a repeat of 2008, when they not only lost the presidency but also lost even more House seats after losing 30 seats and control two years earlier. For the first time this cycle, Democrats have at least as good a chance at gaining House seats as Republicans on a net basis.\n\nThe Senate has been in play for at least nine months, but Democratic chances of winning control of the chamber have improved significantly in the last few weeks. Democrats need a net gain of four seats for a majority, but can control the Senate by gaining three seats and winning the White House. With less than four months to go before Election Day, the most likely outcome is a Democratic net gain of 3-5 Senate seats.\n\nOn the presidential level, Trump is in equally bad shape. The Cook Report gives Biden 279 electoral votes in the solid, likely, or leaning Democrat categories as compared to just 188 for Trump. This week, the University of Virginia's Crystal Ball moved seven traditional Republican strongholds from safe Republican states to likely Republican states and into the slate of potential competitive races in the presidential race.\n\nTrump is extremely unlikely to win if the polls continue to look the way they do now. If these numbers represent a new normal, we need to account for the possibility that this election won't be particularly close, and that new states may come into play. In other words, if the national picture remains bleak for Trump, then the slippage he's seen from earlier this year would not just be limited to a handful of swing states.",
    " Title: Dr. Ben Carson Steps Down as Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Commencement Speaker Following Controversial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Dr. Ben Carson, a prominent figure in conservative media, has announced his withdrawal as commencement speaker at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The decision comes after a wave of criticism following his controversial comments about the LGBT community.\n\nIn a letter to Dean Paul Rothman, Carson expressed his belief that his resignation would be in the best interest of the students, given the national media attention surrounding his statements on traditional marriage.\n\nPreviously, Carson had gained prominence in right-wing media circles after expressing conservative policy ideas during a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. However, this exposure ultimately proved detrimental.\n\nThe controversial remarks, reported by The Baltimore Sun, were made during Carson's March 26 appearance on Fox News' Hannity. He compared efforts to overturn bans on same-sex marriage to those advocating for NAMBLA (the North American Man/Boy Love Association) and \"people who believe in bestiality.\"\n\nThis led to a student-led petition for his removal as commencement speaker, with more than half of the graduating class reportedly signing. Carson also faced criticism from colleagues at Johns Hopkins who found his comments \"hurtful\" and \"extremely discouraging.\"\n\nProfessor Todd Shepard, co-director of Johns Hopkins University's Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, described Carson's statements as \"nasty, petty, and ill-informed.\"\n\nCarson later apologized for his comments, but subsequently called his critics \"racists,\" before apologizing again.\n\nIt was also reported that Carson was scheduled to give the keynote address at a banquet hosted by the Illinois Family Institute, an anti-gay hate group, as of April 2.\n\nAccording to The Baltimore Sun, Carson also stepped down as speaker for the Johns Hopkins University School of Education diploma ceremony. As of now, new speakers have not been chosen for either commencement address.",
    " Title: Felicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison for College Admissions Scam\n\nActress Felicity Huffman, best known for her role in the television series \"Desperate Housewives,\" has been sentenced to 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service, and one year of probation for her involvement in the college entrance scam known as \"Varsity Blues.\"\n\nHuffman, 56, will self-report to a Bureau of Prisons facility on October 25. In a statement released shortly after the sentencing, Huffman accepted the judge's decision and expressed remorse for her actions.\n\n\"I accept the court's decision today without reservation,\" Huffman said in the statement. \"I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\"\n\nHuffman also apologized to her daughter, her husband, her family, and the educational community for her actions. She added that she has learned a lot about her flaws and aims to serve her sentence, complete her community service hours, and make a positive impact on her community.\n\nBefore announcing her decision, Judge Indira Talwani stated that she was not punishing Huffman for a flawed college admissions process but for taking an additional advantage to put her child ahead of others.\n\nHuffman tearfully apologized to her daughters and husband in court, stating that her daughter has asked her why she didn't believe in her. \"I was frightened. I was stupid and I was wrong,\" Huffman said.\n\nEarlier this month, Huffman's lawyers filed papers asking Talwani to not send the Oscar-nominated actress to prison, stating that \"nothing about her history and characteristics require a prison sentence.\"\n\nHuffman's lawyers had asked Talwani to impose a one-year probation term, 250 hours of community service, and a $20,000 fine. However, federal prosecutors asked the judge to sentence Huffman to one month of incarceration, followed by 12 months of supervised release and a fine of $20,000.\n\nThe college admissions scam, the largest ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, involved 50 people, including Huffman and more than 30 other wealthy parents. The indictment alleges that the parents paid bribes to college entrance tutor guru William \"Rick\" Singer, who pleaded guilty in March to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin, best known as Aunt Becky on the sitcom \"Full House,\" and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are fighting charges they paid Singer $500,000 to get their two daughters into USC as recruits for the university's crew team, despite the fact they had never participated in the sport.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of conspiring to commit mail fraud and honest service mail fraud and admitted that she paid Singer $15,000 to falsify her daughter Sophia's SAT score.\n\nHuffman's lawyers presented Talwani with letters vouching for her character from the actress's relatives, including her husband, actor William H. Macy, and former colleagues such as Eva Longoria, a fellow cast member on \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nHuffman and Macy allegedly made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time for their younger daughter, but decided not to do so, according to court documents. Macy was not charged in the scam.\n\n\"To be sure, Felicity's relationship with her daughters exploded on March 12th and rebuilding that relationship will be a long process,\" Macy wrote in his letter to Talwani. \"But I also want you to know Felicity has raised two amazing young women.\"",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Rate Cut: Impact on Consumers and Personal Finances\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate has significant implications for the U.S. economy, but the impact on individual Americans' personal finances is expected to be relatively muted, experts say. The rate reduction, while beneficial, does not offset the increases of recent years, and as the key rate approaches zero, financial institutions are less inclined to pass on the benefits of lower borrowing rates to consumers.\n\nThe Fed's key rate, which affects a wide range of consumer and business loans, was reduced to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday, and the central bank has indicated it is prepared to take further action as necessary to sustain the U.S. economic expansion.\n\nFor consumers, the latest move could result in lower mortgage rates, which, while not directly tied to the Fed's decision, are influenced by some of the same factors. As of last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.56%, a significant drop from 4.6% a year ago, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.\n\nGreg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, estimates that someone with a $200,000 mortgage could potentially save $125 to $150 a month with a reduction of this size, a meaningful increase in a household budget.\n\nHowever, the rate for other forms of borrowing, such as credit cards, home equity loans, or personal loans, is unlikely to see much change. Credit card rates, for example, track the bank prime rate, which is 3% above the federal funds target rate. The prime rate will move down immediately after the Fed's decision, but many credit card issuers do not automatically adjust rates downwards because they have leeway in their contracts to do so.\n\nThe average interest rate on a credit card is 17.61% as of Wednesday, according to Creditcards.com. A year ago, it was 16.92%. Other types of short-term borrowing, such as adjustable rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit, are more directly impacted by changes by the Fed. However, as rates approach zero, they've been less responsive, and experts expect the latest reduction will see a muted reaction.\n\nInterest rates on savings accounts were already historically low and will likely remain so. The FDIC reports that the average rate paid on savings accounts in the U.S. is 0.09%. While some lenders have been offering high-yield savings accounts with rates well above 2%, a few banks have already opted to dial back those offers.\n\nDespite the low rates, consumers should still take steps to shore up their finances, McBride advises. This includes paying down debt, refinancing at lower rates, and boosting emergency savings. This, he says, will enable households to better weather an economic downturn whenever one should materialize.",
    " Title: GOP Chairman Predicts Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Following Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus expressed confidence that a Republican-controlled Congress will pass a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, with President Barack Obama expected to sign it.\n\nDuring the interview, Priebus was asked about specific legislation a Republican Congress would pass following the elections. He responded, \"We will pass a budget in both chambers, number one. And we will pass the Keystone pipeline, number two. I actually think the president will sign the bill on the Keystone pipeline.\"\n\nPriebus argued that there will be greater political pressure on the president to approve the pipeline project due to legislative action. The oil pipeline between Canada and the U.S. has been a contentious issue for years, with many Republicans and some Democrats pushing for the Obama White House to sign off on the project. Critics have argued that the job creation will be negligible and that the pipeline would have significant environmental costs and contribute to climate change.\n\nThe State Department in April instituted another delay in making a decision on the project, which has been criticized as politically motivated. In the interview Tuesday, Priebus also expressed expectations for big gains in the elections but noted that he would not be pleased unless Republicans are able to win in at least one swing state.\n\nMost forecasts show that Republicans are favored to win seats in the House and take control of the Senate, where Democrats in red states have struggled to distance themselves from the Obama White House. \"In a good environment with a very unpopular president, we ought to win in tough states,\" Priebus added.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Unveils Comprehensive Immigration Reform Plan, Promises to End Deportations for Millions of Undocumented Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her ambitious plan for immigration reform on Friday, promising to end deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States if elected. The plan, which includes legislation to be introduced within the first 100 days of her potential administration, aims to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy.\n\nSpeaking before a gathering of the National Associations of Black and Hispanic Journalists in Washington, Clinton emphasized her intention to fast-track the proposal if Democrats manage to retake the Senate in November. \"This is a clear high priority for my administration,\" she said. \"We will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can.\"\n\nClinton's plan, if implemented, would likely follow President Obama's example of taking executive action on immigration reform. The Supreme Court in June deadlocked 4-4 on Obama's 2014 plan to defer deportation for roughly 4.3 million parents of Americans and other lawful permanent residents. Clinton, like her Republican counterpart Donald Trump, would attempt to appoint a justice for the high court's ninth and open seat to help win favorable decisions on such issues.\n\nClinton's campaign website states that she believes the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) is within the president's authority and will not stop fighting until it is implemented. The website also mentions her intention to defend the president's 2012 executive action to defer deportation for millions of people brought into the United States illegally by their parents.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump's campaign, in response, claimed that Clinton intends to assume \"king-like powers\" that would harm Americans. Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who has long argued that \"amnesty\" would take away jobs from unemployed Americans, criticized Clinton's first-100-day pledge as dangerous, stating that it demonstrates her callous and cruel disregard for the safety of the American people.\n\nTrump, who has vowed to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants, has accused Clinton's plan of being tantamount to amnesty for those in the U.S. illegally and of \"totally open borders.\" Trump, in the wake of several deadly attacks inspired or directed by ISIS, has called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the U.S., a stance he has since modified to suggest a ban only for Muslims coming from Middle East terror hotspots such as Syria.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.",
    " Title: Transparency Concerns Surround Obamacare Enrollment Numbers as Administration Faces Calls for Greater Openness\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding inflated Obamacare enrollment numbers has led to renewed demands for the administration to increase transparency and provide more detailed data regarding the health care law. This call for transparency is not limited to Republican opponents in Congress, but also includes consumer groups, health experts, and even strong Obamacare advocates.\n\nIn a statement, Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union, emphasized the need for regular, transparent data to make informed policy decisions. \"Everybody needs the data,\" she said. \"Out in the real world, what we want is regular, transparent data so we can make good policy choices going forward\u2014snapshots in time regularly.\"\n\nRecently, the House Oversight Committee, led by Chairman Darrell Issa, revealed that nearly 400,000 dental plans were included in the enrollment figures, artificially inflating the administration's first-year enrollment target of 7 million for Obamacare. The committee has called CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner and former Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber to testify next month about the \"repeated transparency failures and outright deceptions.\"\n\nAs the second season of Obamacare began last Saturday, there has been no enrollment update since Sunday morning, when HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell tweeted that there were more than half a million log-ins on HealthCare.gov on the first day and that 100,000 applications were submitted.\n\nIn contrast, several of the 13 health insurance exchanges run by states have been regularly releasing traffic and enrollment-related data. Massachusetts, for instance, is issuing daily traffic counts.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) declined to provide an enrollment update on Friday afternoon. The agency has said it would provide detailed monthly reports of plan selection, although this would fall short of the detailed list of suggestions that the Association of Health Care Journalists sent to the agency in late October. The group requested weekly or biweekly releases with more granular data than last year's reports provided.\n\nFederal health officials have yet to fully explain the nature of what Burwell described as an \"unacceptable\" mistake in including the dental plan data in the August and October enrollment totals. However, in a letter to Issa, Tavenner suggested that part of the problem was the still unfinished back end of HealthCare.gov\u2014the part that communicates with insurance companies.\n\nThe administration seemed able to turn the numbers around quickly when Obamacare's initial drama started turning around. \"Once HealthCare.gov started rocking in the early months of 2014, HHS eased up a bit, blasting out releases on key mileposts as they reached them,\" Erik Wemple wrote in The Washington Post this week. \"In February and March, enrollment hit 4 million and 5 million, respectively, and HHS saw no need to wait weeks to tell the public.\"\n\nThe agency's record on transparency with the health care law has been uneven at best. During the month after the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov last October, HHS was virtually a black box\u2014except for when it released faulty information, such as its initial explanation that the website's main problem was too much traffic by an eager public.\n\nAs the administration's emergency \"tech surge\" began to salvage the failing site, HHS pivoted sharply, holding near-daily conference calls with reporters to update repair progress. Data disclosure continued to lag, however; the administration refused to release any figures for more than two months. In December, it began giving detailed monthly reports. Those stopped after May and the close of the regular enrollment season\u2014until the brief flawed announcement from Tavenner before a congressional panel in September.\n\n\"A mistake was made in calculating the number of individuals with effectuated Marketplace enrollments,\" Tavenner noted in her letter to Issa. \"While there were 7.3 million effectuated enrollments, approximately 393,000 individuals had both Marketplace medical and dental coverage as of August 15, 2014.\"\n\nThe mistake was repeated in a November update. CMS now says 6.7 million had private Obamacare coverage as of Oct. 15.\n\nThe agency does have highly detailed enrollment data for other health programs it oversees, including Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug coverage for seniors. However, Capitol Street Managing Director Ipsita Smolinski said, \"It's kind of apples and oranges\" to compare data from the exchanges and those programs.\n\nLarry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation noted that if such detailed data were public for Obamacare, data discrepancies like the one that emerged Thursday would be more easily identified. \"This could raise broader questions about whether detailed enrollment data by insurer and plan should be made public or kept confidential because it is proprietary,\" he said.\n\nHowever, it took some time before such detailed data became available for the Medicare prescription drug program, and the federal system handling Obamacare is not even finished. \"I don't think it's sinister,\" Imholz said. \"I just think it's so complex and evolving; I just think we're at the beginning of the process.\"",
    " Title: MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Shooting Victims Reach Settlement Worth $735 Million to $800 Million\n\nIn a significant development, MGM Resorts International and the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting have reached a settlement worth between $735 million and $800 million, according to a statement by MGM on Thursday. The settlement is not an admission of liability in the tragic event that left 58 dead and hundreds wounded or injured.\n\nMGM Resorts Chairman and CEO, Jim Murren, expressed hope that the agreement would facilitate the healing process for the Las Vegas community and the victims and their families. \"Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,\" Murren said.\n\nRobert Eglet, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, described the agreement as a milestone in the recovery process. \"While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,\" Eglet said.\n\nThe shooter, a 64-year-old reclusive gambler, opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, owned and operated by MGM Resorts. He fired for between 10 to 15 minutes at the country music festival, killing 58 people. As many as 700 people were wounded or injured trying to escape the area.\n\nThe shooter was found dead in his hotel room with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have not been able to determine his motive in carrying out the massacre. Police found 23 guns inside his hotel suite and discovered that he had brought more than 10 suitcases to the room over several days, authorities said.\n\nLawsuits filed since the shooting questioned how and why the hotel did not know he was hoarding high-powered weapons and ammunition in his hotel room in the days leading up to the attack. According to a regulatory filing released in May, MGM said it could pay as much as $800 million for lawsuits related to the mass shooting. The document noted that the company has about $751 million in insurance coverage that can be used to help cover such costs.\n\nChelsea Romo, who lost her left eye and still has shrapnel in her right eye after being shot in the head during the shooting two years ago, expressed gratitude for the settlement. \"To know that something good can come from something so horrible is I guess the only thing I could ask for out of all of this,\" Romo said.\n\nJason McMillan, a 37-year-old Riverside County sheriff's deputy who was shot and paralyzed, also expressed relief over the settlement. \"The scars and injuries from that night can never be erased,\" he said. \"I'm glad we could reach a resolution that allows us to put this nightmare behind us so our family can move forward and start focusing on the future.\"\n\nSteve Melanson, whose wife Rosemarie was injured in the shooting, spoke to CNN after learning of the settlement. \"We had no idea a settlement was reached until today. We're happy that they came to an agreement and settlement,\" he said. \"But no amount of money can bring the 58 people who were killed back. No amount of money can cure the extreme pain that my wife is still suffering.\"\n\nRosemarie Melanson spent 13 months in the hospital after the shooting and has had more than a dozen surgeries. Her husband said her surgeries are not over and that she has another surgery this month due to complications from being shot. \"She was shot once, but the bullet exploded inside of her, leaving her riddled with shrapnel that tore through her body. Our whole family has been on a roller-coaster that won't stop. She has another surgery scheduled this month,\" he told CNN. \"But ultimately, we are so thankful that she is alive.\"\n\nHe stressed that the path to recovery will be a life-long journey for her. \"It is not over for us. She has made wonderful progress. There are so many families. Our medical bills are in the millions, (but) fortunately our insurance is good. It's covered most of it. But what about those who do not have insurance or good coverage? The settlement will hopefully offer a little closure to many who have suffered,\" he said.\n\nAttorney Jim Frantz, who represents nearly 200 survivors and the families of four victims, said the settlement \"should be a message to all the other corporations, businesses around the country, that they step up their security.\" The settlement marks a significant step forward in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Religious Liberty Stance Under Scrutiny: Contraception Mandate and International Human Rights Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a meeting with Pope Francis at the White House Wednesday, President Obama reiterated his administration's stance in defense of religious liberty. \"We stand with you in defense of religious freedom,\" Obama said, emphasizing the importance of practicing faith freely. However, the administration's stance has come under scrutiny in recent times, with two significant issues emerging.\n\nFirstly, the Obama administration's legal battle with the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order, has been a point of contention. A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Little Sisters must comply with the Obamacare mandate, requiring their health insurance carriers to subsidize contraceptive and some abortion services for employees or face fines from the IRS. The order argues that the mandate infringes on its First Amendment rights by compelling it to support practices that violate its core religious beliefs.\n\nSecondly, the administration's response to the human rights crisis in Syria and Iraq has been criticized. In these regions, where Christians and other religious minorities have lived for centuries, ISIS and other Islamist extremists are carrying out a genocide, targeting Christians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, and other defenseless religious minorities. The administration, apart from last year's airstrikes to help the Yazidis, has been accused of failing to stand for and defend these persecuted communities.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, ISIS launched its caliphate from Mosul, marking Christian homes with the red letter \"N,\" for \"Nazarene,\" before confiscating them and exiling their owners. Since then, ISIS has pursued Christians and other minorities with a systematic intensity, aiming to erase all traces of their ancient presence.\n\nIn a separate topic, the Pope's awareness of President Obama's pro-abortion stance, particularly his stance on infanticide, has been raised. However, the Pope's focus on climate change and other global issues may have overshadowed this matter.",
    " Title: A Century of Police Reform: A Historical Perspective on Police Misconduct and the Pursuit of Change\n\nArticle:\n\nThe history of police reform in the United States, particularly in New York City, has been a long and arduous one, marked by numerous investigations and commissions aimed at addressing police misconduct. From the Lexow Committee in 1894 to the Obama administration's President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, these efforts have sought to address issues such as excessive force, brutality, and biased policing.\n\nThe Lexow Committee, established in 1894, was the first major investigation into police misconduct in New York City. The most common complaint at the time was \"clubbing,\" or the routine use of nightsticks and blackjacks to physically assault citizens. The Wickersham Commission, convened in 1931, provided a damning indictment of the criminal justice system, including evidence of brutal interrogation tactics. The commission attributed these issues to a lack of professionalism among the police force.\n\nFollowing the 1967 urban uprisings, the Kerner Commission found that police actions were the final straw before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders. The commission's report recommended building community support for law enforcement and reviewing police operations in urban areas to ensure proper conduct by officers.\n\nDespite these efforts, police violence has persisted, leading to calls for reform following incidents such as the brutal police beating of Rodney King in 1991 and the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The final report of the Obama administration's President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing resulted in procedural changes like implicit-bias training, police-community listening sessions, and slight alterations to use-of-force policies and systems for identifying potentially problematic officers.\n\nHowever, as noted by Tracey Meares, a member of the task force, in 2017, \"policing as we know it must be abolished before it can be transformed.\" This sentiment underscores the ongoing challenge of reforming a system that continues to face issues with rule-breaking by officers, as evidenced by recent incidents of police brutality and violence against protesters.\n\nThe philosophy underpinning these reforms is that more rules will lead to less violence. However, the persistence of police misconduct suggests that this approach may not be sufficient. As the nation continues to grapple with issues of police violence and systemic racism, the question remains: What will it take to bring about meaningful, lasting change in policing?",
    " Title: Democrats Unveil Comprehensive Climate Plan, Aiming for Net-Zero Emissions by 2050\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards addressing climate change, Democrats have unveiled a comprehensive plan that mandates a transition to 100% zero-carbon power for utilities, with escalating requirements beginning almost immediately. The plan also includes new requirements for states to submit plans detailing their strategies to meet net-zero emissions targets.\n\nThe plan calls for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to integrate climate considerations into natural gas-related decisions, and for the promotion of low-carbon buildings codes and infrastructure. It also proposes vastly stronger vehicle emissions rules and support for electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure.\n\nA key aspect of the plan is the \"buy clean program,\" which aims to spur decarbonization of energy-intensive manufacturing. The plan also includes mandates for the oil-and-gas industry to significantly reduce methane emissions. Additionally, a \"National Climate Bank\" is proposed to boost investment in low-carbon technology deployment.\n\nEnergy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone signaled that Democrats are laying the groundwork for potential legislation if they gain control of Washington in the 2020 elections. Pallone expressed pessimism about Republican support for an aggressive bill, stating, \"There\u2019s a fundamental problem here which I would be crazy not to acknowledge, which is most of them are climate deniers.\"\n\nThe plan, while not explicitly relying on carbon pricing, allows power companies to trade clean energy credits and purchase them via auction under the \"clean electricity standard.\" The plan also mentions the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the existing cap-and-trade program among northeastern states, as an option for states.\n\nThe plan credits nuclear power and fossil generation with carbon capture in the \"clean electricity standard,\" a move that has been met with criticism from some environmental groups. The upstart Sunrise Movement, an advocacy group aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, has criticized the plan for not going far enough in addressing the climate crisis and economic inequality.\n\nThe plan is a step in the right direction, according to the Sunrise Movement, but it \"falls short of the scale and scope of action the U.S. must take to tackle the dual crises of climate change and skyrocketing inequality.\" The environmental group Friends of the Earth has also criticized the plan.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Accelerates Resolution of Title IX Complaints Against Universities and Colleges\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Education Department under President Donald Trump has been closing Title IX gender-discrimination complaints against universities and colleges at a significantly faster pace than the Obama administration, according to federal data.\n\nThe Trump administration's desire to more quickly wrap up these investigations, which generally involve alleged sexual assaults on campus, reflects years of protest from universities and some conservative groups that the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama was using individual assault cases to open broad, years-long investigations into university practices.\n\nUnder Mr. Obama, Title IX complaints that closed between 2010 and 2016 had remained open an average of 150 days. That number stayed fairly constant other than in 2013 when the administration wrapped up cases faster than in other years\u2014an average of 78 days. In 2017, when Mr. Trump, a Republican, took office, the average length of an open complaint was 88 days. Cases opened in the first four months of this year were resolved after an average of 39 days.\n\nLast year, the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos opted to end an Obama-administration practice of broadening individual student's complaints to look for systemic issues in how schools were handling sexual assault and harassment. Schools often complained the inquiries were excessive or unfair.\n\nThat expansive approach meant the department was focusing too much on schools and not enough on students who felt they had been wronged, said Peter McDonough, general counsel of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents.\n\nMr. McDonough said the policy under Mr. Obama created a \"perception that investigators had to find something\u2026And on campuses, it became seen as a 'gotcha' game.\"\n\nCivil-rights advocates disagreed, saying Mr. Obama's more expansive approach drilled to the root of discrimination. The current practice of closing cases as quickly as possible, they said, risks overlooking systemic violations that may be affecting more than one student.\n\nCatherine Lhamon, who headed the Education Department's civil rights office in Mr. Obama's second term, said the only times the department opened broader cases were for high-profile investigations involving Michigan State University and the University of Southern California. Both cases featured much-publicized medical faculty members accused of assaulting numerous patients.\n\nMs. Lhamon said those cases reflect a broader reality that sexual harassment exists widely on campuses, and that one person's case can shed light on whether the university has mishandled similar situations.\n\n\"That's a red flag that if you don't look, someone else will be harmed,\" Ms. Lhamon said. \"So why would the department that is charged with preventing harm against every student, why would you think, 'We don't need to look?'\"\n\nThe data, released to The Wall Street Journal under the Freedom of Information Act, contain all Title IX complaints against colleges and universities between 2010 and early May of this year.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump's administration, the percentage of investigations ending in resolution agreements, which lay out policy changes for the institution and include a monitoring period, also fell. Nearly one in 12 cases ended in resolution agreements during Mr. Obama's tenure, compared with closer to one in 50 under Mr. Trump.\n\nMost complaints that didn't reach resolution agreements were dismissed, though the Trump administration has also dismissed a higher number of cases, the Journal found. More than 90% of the cases since 2017 have been dismissed, while in the six years prior, that figure was closer to 67%.\n\nThe Education Department can dismiss a case because the department determines it lacks jurisdiction or if it finds the allegation fails to state a violation, lacks sufficient detail, or is speculative or incoherent. The Journal's data don't indicate the justification for individual case dismissals.\n\nLiz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said resolving complaints without long delays is a priority for the Office for Civil Rights.\n\n\"Part of what makes OCR's mission meaningful is that OCR weighs in on crucial civil-rights issues in a timely way,\" she said. \"Without an effort at timely resolution, a student complaining of civil-rights violations in, say, middle school might not get an answer from OCR until he or she has graduated from high school.\"\n\nThe administration has more broadly been looking to change the department's approach to enforcement of Title IX, the 1970s-era law prohibiting gender discrimination in educational settings.\n\nIn September, Mrs. DeVos rescinded a controversial Obama-era policy that directed schools to use a standard of evidence that was less rigorous than some schools had been employing. The standard, known as \"preponderance of the evidence,\" meaning simply \"more likely than not,\" is the typical standard applied in civil-rights lawsuits; however, some due-process advocates said that standard made it too easy for schools to find an accused person guilty.\n\nThe administration hopes to release its own set of rules as early as September, and Education Department officials may mandate a higher standard of evidence, according to people familiar with their conversations.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Taps Law Professor Maya Harris to Lead Policy Team, Focuses on Women of Color Voting Bloc\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move aimed at shaping her 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton has appointed Maya Harris, a law professor and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, to her policy team. Harris, the sister of California Senate candidate Kamala Harris, is not a familiar face in Clintonland, but her expertise on the growing voting power of women of color could prove crucial for Clinton's efforts to expand the Obama coalition.\n\nIn her paper, \"Women of Color: A Growing Force in the American Electorate,\" Harris criticizes politicians and political strategists for overlooking the unique concerns of women of color within broader efforts aimed at women, youth, or specific racial or ethnic groups. Instead, she argues, women of color represent a distinct and rapidly growing voting bloc that requires targeted attention to ensure their interests are prioritized on the policy agenda.\n\nHarris's paper does not delve into specific policy proposals, but her political theory offers an intriguing glimpse into how Clinton's campaign might tailor its approach to engage and mobilize women of color. The paper's central argument is that women of color will be decisive in future elections, as they constitute the fastest-growing segment of eligible women voters since 2000, accounting for 74% of the growth in eligible women voters.\n\nMoreover, women of color are not only eligible to vote but also tend to vote at higher rates than men, as demonstrated by a chart from Harris's paper. African-American women, for instance, vote at higher rates than any other subgroup, underscoring the importance of this demographic in electoral outcomes.\n\nWhile Obama's 2008 campaign was careful to avoid proposing policy specifically aimed at the African-American community, Clinton's position is different. With a majority of the electorate being female and a majority of voters of color being female, Clinton can potentially appeal directly to women in a way that Obama could not to the African-American community.\n\nIn hiring Harris to help lead policy on her campaign, it is a reasonable assumption that Clinton is signaling her intention to prioritize women of color and provide reasons for them to turn out at the polls. By doing so, Clinton might run a campaign that is more focused on gender than Obama's, with Harris's expertise guiding policy decisions that could resonate with women of color.\n\nIn conclusion, the appointment of Maya Harris to Hillary Clinton's policy team underscores the importance of women of color in the 2016 presidential election. As a law professor and policy expert on this demographic, Harris's insights could play a significant role in shaping Clinton's campaign strategy and policy proposals, with the ultimate goal of engaging and mobilizing women of color to vote.",
    " Title: Oprah Winfrey's Presidential Aspirations Gain Momentum Following Golden Globes Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nOprah Winfrey's longtime partner, Stedman Graham, has added fuel to the growing speculation that the media mogul is seriously considering a presidential bid. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Graham stated, \"She would absolutely do it.\"\n\nThe NBC network and numerous celebrities have already dubbed Winfrey as \"our future president\" following her powerful speech at the Golden Globes, where she referenced civil rights and the #MeToo movement, highlighting the rampant sexual harassment in the industry.\n\nThe iconic talk show host was also the recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award that night, the first ever awarded to a black woman. In her acceptance speech, Winfrey spoke passionately about the Me Too and civil rights movement, stating, \"For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up.\"\n\nThe response to Winfrey's speech was overwhelming, with numerous celebrities and commentators expressing their support for a potential Winfrey presidential campaign. Liberal MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted, \"Switched back to the Golden Globes to watch Oprah get her award. Never let it be said that I don\u2019t respect the president of the United States.\"\n\nSeth Meyers, the award's host, also made a joke about Winfrey running for president, but the network quickly deleted the tweet that followed, stating, \"Nothing but respect for OUR future president.\"\n\nAs the speculation continues to grow, Winfrey has yet to officially announce any political aspirations. However, her powerful speech and the overwhelming support from the public and celebrities have certainly sparked hope for a potential Winfrey presidency in 2020. Winfrey ended her speech with a hopeful note that \"a new day was on the horizon\" because of people who will \"take us to the time when nobody ever has to say \u2018me too\u2019 again.\"",
    " Title: China Demands Release of Huawei CFO Amidst US Probe, Global Market Volatility\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has called for the immediate release of Huawei's Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was detained in Canada on 1 December. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, could face extradition to the US, with the charges against her yet to be disclosed. The arrest was made in Vancouver, but the details were not made public at Meng's request.\n\nThe US has been investigating Huawei over potential violations of sanctions against Iran. Meng has sought a publication ban on the details of the arrest, which has been granted by the courts. Huawei has stated that it is \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng.\"\n\nThe arrest has sparked global market volatility, with European shares hitting a two-year low and Asian indexes dropping sharply following the arrest. Analysts suggest that the arrest revives concerns over the US-China trade war. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated, \"The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights.\"\n\nBeijing has made \"solemn representations\" to Canada and the US, demanding clarification of the reasons for the detention and the immediate release of the detainee to protect her legal rights. China has also announced that it will \"immediately\" implement the measures agreed during the 90-day tariff truce negotiated between the two nations at the G20.\n\nThe arrest coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia, and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks.\n\nA bail hearing for Meng is scheduled for Friday, according to Canada's ministry of justice. The arrest is a significant event, with Huawei being considered the \"crown jewel\" of Chinese tech and Meng being seen as effectively its \"princess.\"\n\nThe US Commerce and Treasury Departments are reportedly investigating Huawei for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran and North Korea. US lawmakers have accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.\n\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton stated on Thursday that he had known in advance about Meng's arrest, but did not confirm if President Donald Trump was also aware. In a statement, Huawei said it had complied with \"all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US, and EU.\"\n\nThe arrest is a top trending topic on Chinese social media, with many users criticizing the US and Canada for \"low\" and \"bullying\" tactics. Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control.\n\nThe US has brought a number of legal cases against Chinese technology firms, with accusations including cyber-security theft and violations of Iran sanctions. President Trump reinstated all US sanctions on Iran that had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal last month. Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.",
    " Title: Trump's \"America First\" Policy: A Shift in U.S. Foreign Policy and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe inaugural address of President Donald Trump has sparked a wave of discussions and debates, with a particular focus on his foreign policy stance. While the flurry of executive orders and Cabinet nominations have been encouraging to conservative skeptics, the foreign-policy section of the address has received less attention but deserves more.\n\nTrump's foreign policy, as outlined in his inaugural address, represents a significant departure from the American national interest as understood since World War II. Trump's vision of the world is one in which foreign relations are reduced to a zero-sum game, where gains for others equate to losses for the U.S.\n\nIn his address, Trump stated, \"For many decades, we\u2019ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while depleting our own.\" He also asserted, \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\"\n\nTrump's foreign policy does not distinguish between friends and foes, a stark contrast to John F. Kennedy's inaugural pledge to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Trump's \"America First\" policy is a departure from the exceptionalist narrative that defined the U.S. in the global arena.\n\nThe phrase \"America First\" echoes the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that advocated for neutrality during World War II. While Trump may not have intended this reference, the resonance of this historical context is not lost on world leaders.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" policy is not a reassertion of American exceptionalism but, on the contrary, the antithesis. It positions the U.S. as no different from other countries that define themselves by blood-and-soil nationalism. The exceptionalism of the U.S., its unique role in the world, was defined by its national interest extending beyond narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies.\n\nSome argue that Trump's \"America First\" policy is a bargaining chip for negotiating better terms of trade or alliance. However, this interpretation is demonstrably wrong. Trump's inaugural address is not an off-the-cuff riff but the product of deliberate crafting. Moreover, Trump's \"America First\" proclamation was preceded by a statement that \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\"\n\nThe withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump's long-promised but abrupt move, is the first tangible evidence of his foreign policy doctrine. This shift in policy could have significant implications for the U.S. and the West, as the international system of open commerce and democratic alliances has been a cornerstone of American and Western growth and prosperity for 70 years.\n\nIn conclusion, the Trump administration's \"America First\" policy represents a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. This policy, if implemented, could lead to a more insular and small-minded approach to global leadership, with potential long-term consequences for the U.S. and the West.",
    " Title: \"Call to Action: A Plea for Marco Rubio to Steer Clear of Controversial Immigration Stances\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article, the author expresses concern over Senator Marco Rubio's political trajectory, urging him to reconsider his stance on immigration reform. The piece, titled \"Save Rubio from Himself,\" argues that Rubio's recent involvement in immigration debates has led to a series of headlines that are damaging his reputation within the conservative movement.\n\nThe article cites several controversial headlines from prominent conservative media outlets such as Breitbart.com, RedState.com, The Daily Caller, and the Washington Examiner. These headlines, the author notes, have been critical of Rubio, accusing him of undermining conservative causes, lying, and being used as a political pawn by Democratic leaders.\n\nFurthermore, a recent piece by Rich Lowry in National Review portrays Rubio as a naive politician manipulated by Democratic strategist Chuck Schumer. This characterization, the author suggests, is far from the image of a future conservative standard-bearer ready to challenge the Democrats on the national stage.\n\nThe author, who previously wrote an open letter to Rubio warning him about associating with liberals and Republicans In Name Only (RINOs), believes the senator's current political position is worse than anticipated. The author criticizes Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, for a Twitter spat with a conservative reporter that was perceived as racially insensitive.\n\nThe article concludes by urging Rubio to reconsider his approach to immigration reform, suggesting that his current stance is damaging his political potential and alienating his conservative base. The author calls for Rubio to focus on issues that benefit law-abiding citizens and taxpayers, rather than engaging in controversial debates that divide the conservative movement.",
    " Title: Iowa Republican State Convention Marked by Discord as Ron Paul Supporters Dominate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa Republican State Convention on Saturday was marked by discord and tension, with many longtime party activists expressing concerns about the influence of Texas Rep. Ron Paul's supporters. The event, which took place before the national convention in Florida this summer, saw a series of heated exchanges and calls for unity.\n\nIf Saturday's convention is any indication, Mitt Romney may not be in for smooth sailing at the national convention. The rancor at the Iowa convention was evident, with the parliamentarian threatening to eject anyone speaking out of turn. The division stems from Paul's supporters, who will make up all but a handful of Iowa's 28 delegates going to Tampa.\n\nOut of the 25 delegates up for a vote at the convention, 21 support Paul. These delegates are unbound, meaning they can vote for whomever they choose at the national convention. Delegate Bethany Gates of Benton County expressed concerns that going with Paul could tarnish the image of the party and the state's first-in-the-nation caucus status.\n\n\"So far, we've already had two different candidates that are declared a winner,\" she said. \"If we go to national with a third candidate... we are going to look ridiculous.\"\n\nThe controversy stems from party officials coming under fire after they initially reported that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had won the caucus in January, but then named former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum the winner after a recount. Paul came in a close third, but his supporters have continued to organize on his behalf.\n\nSaturday's event also included calls for unity from several speakers, among them longtime Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. He urged the crowd to deliver the swing state to Romney. \"Either it's four more years of President Obama, or it's a new day,\" he said. \"And every one of you want it to be a new day.\"\n\nState Party Chairman A.J. Spiker, who left the Paul campaign to assume his new role earlier this year, also called for unity. However, he failed to mention Romney's name during his speech.\n\nProminent blogger Craig Robinson, who was undecided during caucus season, says the outcome of the convention does not represent what happened at the caucuses. He also says the division is not helping the Iowa GOP.\n\n\"It does not seem like we're acting like a majority party,\" he said. \"We're acting like a minority party that's having an identity crisis and struggle that is more common after defeat than victories.\"\n\nHowever, Jeff Taylor, a Paul supporter who was chosen as a national delegate this weekend, said internal disagreements could be good for the party.\n\n\"We'd have a bigger audience for the conventions if we were a little bit more of a throwback to the old days, before it was all so cut-and-dried and... a slick package,\" he said.\n\nIf Paul supporters have their way, the convention in Tampa may be anything but the slick package Romney and much of the GOP are hoping for.",
    " Title: Canadian House of Commons Unanimously Rebukes President Trump's Criticism of Prime Minister Trudeau\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous vote on Monday, Canada's House of Commons passed a motion rejecting \"disparaging ad hominem statements\" from U.S. officials, a move aimed at President Donald Trump and his advisers for their criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following the G-7 summit in Montreal over the weekend.\n\nThe motion, proposed by MP Tracey Ramsey of the New Democratic Party, was a symbolic gesture to demonstrate the solidarity and united front of Canada's Parliament against the divisive actions of the U.S. President after his visit to Canada and the G-7 meetings.\n\n\"I believe this was an important step to show the solidarity and united front of Canada's Parliament against the deliberately divisive actions of the president of the United States after his visit to Canada and the G-7 meetings this weekend,\" said Ms. Ramsey.\n\nThe motion was prompted by President Trump's criticism of Prime Minister Trudeau over the weekend, following the latter's vow to retaliate against tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. on Canadian steel and aluminum products.\n\n\"I have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it is something that we absolutely will do, because Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,\" Mr. Trudeau said during a press conference Saturday after President Trump had already left the summit.\n\nIn response, President Trump called Mr. Trudeau \"dishonest\" and \"weak\" on Twitter, and his surrogates amplified the attack during media appearances over the weekend. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said, \"There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door.\"\n\nIn addition to rejecting the insults aimed at Mr. Trudeau, the motion also strongly opposed the \"illegitimate tariffs imposed by the U.S. government against Canadian steel and aluminum workers\" and stood in solidarity with the Government of Canada in its decision to impose retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\"At this difficult moment in our history with our U.S. neighbors, Canadians need to know that all sides of this House stand united as one,\" Ms. Ramsey said Monday.",
    " Title: New Text Message from FBI's Strzok Suggests Lack of Evidence of Trump-Russia Collusion, According to Sen. Johnson\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, revealed a text message sent by Peter Strzok, the FBI's top agent on the Trump-Russia investigation, that suggests he saw no evidence of Trump campaign collusion.\n\nDuring an interview with WISN-Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber, Johnson read aloud a May 19, 2017 text that Strzok sent to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and his mistress. The text message, which Johnson described as \"jaw-dropping,\" reads: \"You and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I\u2019d be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there\u2019s no big there there.\"\n\nJohnson stated that the text referred to the Mueller investigation, which had just begun two days earlier. Strzok joined that team, but was removed in July after the Justice Department's inspector general discovered his anti-Trump text exchanges with Page.\n\nAs the FBI's deputy counterintelligence chief, Strzok was picked in July 2016 to oversee the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. Prior to that, he was a top investigator on the Clinton email inquiry.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s kind of jaw-dropping,\" said Johnson, a Republican, of the Strzok text. \"In other words, Peter Strzok, who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division, the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn\u2019t abide Donald Trump being president, is saying that his gut sense is that there\u2019s no big there there when it comes to the Mueller special counsel investigation.\"\n\nThe text message was included in 400 pages of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. Lawmakers have started reviewing the trove of documents for evidence of anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias.\n\nJohnson also addressed the revelation last Friday that the FBI \"failed to preserve\" five months worth of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. A Justice Department official told Johnson's committee and five other congressional panels that a \"misconfiguration\" issue caused \"many\" FBI-issued mobile devices to not back up to the bureau's servers.\n\nThe FBI said it does not have text messages for Strzok and Page for the period between Dec. 14, 2016 and May 17, 2017\u2014the day that Mueller was appointed. Johnson stated that Congress needs to see the missing text messages because Strzok and Page were \"completely unguarded in their communication.\"\n\n\"So we\u2019re getting insight into exactly what is happening inside the FBI at the highest levels,\" he said. \"And who knows who else they might implicate in terms of corruption.\"\n\nJohnson released two pages of Strzok-Page messages from May 19, 2017. They show the pair seemingly discussing the new Mueller investigation and whether they wanted to join. The messages show that Strzok and Page discussed the historical significance of the investigation and its potential impact on their career trajectory.\n\nThe messages also reveal Strzok's apparent attempt to coax Page into joining the Mueller investigation, with Strzok stating that it was \"maybe the most important case of our lives.\" In another text, Strzok referred to his work on the Clinton investigation.\n\n\"For me, and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished business,\" he said. \"I unleashed it with MYE. Now I need to fix it and finish it.\"\n\n\"MYE\" refers to \"Mid-Year Exam,\" the FBI's code name for the Clinton investigation. \"You shouldn\u2019t take this on,\" Page then wrote. \"I promise you, I would tell you if you should.\"\n\nAfter several exchanges discussing their positions at the FBI, Strzok suggested to Page that he did not want to take on the Mueller job because of his \"gut sense and concern there\u2019s no big there there.\"\n\nThe full text messages can be found on Scribd.",
    " Title: House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Issues Subpoenas in Three Ongoing Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), has issued subpoenas to three federal agencies as part of three ongoing investigations. The subpoenas were issued before the August recess, with the aim of gathering more information on the IRS targeting of conservative groups, the 2012 Benghazi attack, and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \"secret science\" behind its Clear Air Act regulations.\n\nOn Friday, the committee issued a subpoena to the Treasury Department for hundreds of thousands of pages of documents related to the IRS's targeting of conservative groups, including any communications between the White House, IRS, or Treasury Department on the matter. On Thursday, two subpoenas were sent to the State Department for information regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nThe State and Treasury departments have been given until Aug. 16 to respond to the subpoenas. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, also issued a subpoena to the EPA as part of its probe into the \"secret science\" behind the EPA's Clear Air Act regulations.\n\nThe IRS controversy and the Benghazi incident are not new developments, with the House and Senate committees continuing to press for more information. The IRS has only provided a fraction of the more than 600,000 pages of documents related to the IRS scandal, including emails and communications from agency employees involved in screening applications for non-profit status by conservative organizations.\n\nThe Benghazi controversy is also not going away, with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee already receiving access to 25,000 pages of Benghazi documents from the State Department. However, these documents are not allowed to be retained by congressional investigators. Since May, Issa has issued four document subpoenas to the State Department seeking additional information, with more subpoenas seeking testimony from department officials.\n\n\"After ignoring requests for months, the State Department has left no alternative but to issue subpoenas for documents relevant to our investigation,\" Issa said Thursday. \"State Department tactics to delay and impede accountability have exhausted the Committee's patience. Further subpoenas may also be necessary if the Department is not forthcoming on other requests.\"\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is currently involved in a legal battle with the Justice Department over the Fast and Furious scandal, in which thousands of U.S.-made guns were allowed to \"walk\" to Mexican drug cartels as part of a botched investigation into weapons trafficking. The House approved civil and criminal contempt resolutions against Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to comply with a subpoena issued as part of the probe. The Justice Department refused to enforce the criminal contempt resolution against Holder, and the House committee then sued the Justice Department in Aug. 2012 in federal court to enforce the civil contempt resolution. That case is still pending.\n\nIssa, a vocal critic of President Obama, complained in a Friday letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that the IRS has \"engaged in a systematic effort to delay, frustrate, impede, and obstruct the Committee's investigation.\" The IRS has made 70,000 pages of documents available to the committee, with more than 70 IRS lawyers working on processing the information requests by Congress.\n\nRep. Lamar Smith also complained that the Science Committee has unsuccessfully sought information from the EPA since Sept. 2011 outlining how it determines allowable levels of airborne pollutants. \"This subpoena could have been avoided,\" Smith said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've been put in this position by an agency that willfully disregards congressional requests and makes its rules using undisclosed data.\"\n\nDemocrats on the Science Committee mocked the GOP's efforts, saying they were clearly done at the behest of special-interest groups. \"I have to assume you'll be passing this data to, excuse my language, industry hacks,\" said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), ranking member of the Science panel. \"To so blatantly be doing the bidding of polluting industries is simply mind-boggling.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Shift: From Bad Cop to Good Cop with Pompeo, Bolton, and Haley\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in his foreign policy approach, President Donald Trump, with his team of foreign-policy hardliners in place, may be transitioning from the role of the \"bad cop\" to the \"good cop.\" During his first 15 months in office, Trump has been known for his aggressive rhetoric and actions, such as his criticism of NATO allies, his nicknames for world leaders, and his military interventions in Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, with the appointment of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, John Bolton as National Security Adviser, and Nikki Haley as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Trump may now be adopting a more diplomatic approach. These appointees, known for their hawkish views and willingness to challenge the status quo, are expected to take risks and restore U.S. strategic deterrence.\n\nThis shift in roles mirrors the dynamic between President Richard Nixon and his national-security adviser Henry Kissinger. Nixon often postured as a tough leader, while Kissinger was sent to negotiate and reassure allies and enemies. The goal was to gain compromises and advantages that would have been difficult to achieve otherwise.\n\nIn this new role, Trump may now express his concerns about escalating tensions with countries like North Korea, Iran, and China, while his hardline appointees ratchet up the pressure. This approach could have several advantages for Trump.\n\nFirst, it aligns with Trump's campaign promises to avoid entangling overseas interventions. By appearing to be the skeptic on foreign interventions, Trump can appeal to his swing-state, blue-collar supporters who were wary of foreign entanglements.\n\nSecond, Trump's art-of-the-deal style allows him to play the mediator, offering a last chance for agreement before his hardline appointees take over. This approach allows Trump to present himself as a dealmaker, a role he has often emphasized in his political career.\n\nThird, Trump's relationship with Defense Secretary James Mattis, who is known for his caution and reluctance to intervene abroad, may also benefit from this shift. With Trump and Mattis on the same side, they can present a unified front of caution and compromise, rather than confrontation.\n\nIn summary, the tough reputations of Pompeo, Bolton, and Haley now allow Trump to be what he always was \u2013 a dealmaker. This shift in roles could lead to a more diplomatic approach to foreign policy, as Trump outsources his hawkishness to his hardline appointees, while emphasizing compromise and agreement as the last resort.",
    " Title: Obama Criticizes China's Absence in TPP Pacific Rim Free-Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent address to the nation, U.S. President Barack Obama criticized China's exclusion from the newly concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Pacific Rim free-trade deal. The 12-country accord, finalized after five years of negotiations, is set to be the largest regional trade pact ever if approved by all signatories.\n\nPresident Obama emphasized that the TPP, with its strongest labor and environmental standards in history, will level the playing field in international trade. He stated, \"Without this agreement, competitors that do not share our values, like China, will write the rules of the global economy.\" He further added, \"They'll keep selling into our markets and try to lure companies over there, meanwhile they'll keep their markets closed to us.\"\n\nThe TPP, spanning about two-fifths of the global economy, aims to set the rules for 21st-century trade and marks one of Obama's key diplomatic and economic achievements. The deal is expected to encourage investment and pressure China to align its commerce, investment, and business regulation practices with TPP standards.\n\nHowever, the TPP has faced opposition from activists who argue it favors big business over consumers and governments. U.S. congressional leaders have also expressed reservations about the deal even before the details have been released.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promoted the TPP negotiations during her tenure and is now the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election, has come out against the deal. Clinton stated that, given what she knows about the deal, it falls short of her \"high bar\" for creating American jobs, raising wages, and advancing U.S. national security.\n\nUnder the TPP, 98 percent of tariffs will be eliminated on a wide range of goods, including beef, dairy products, wine, sugar, rice, horticulture, seafood, manufactured products, resources, and energy. The countries involved are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.",
    " Title: High School Students Across the U.S. Adapt to Reality of School Violence, Prioritizing Safety in Daily Routines\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at a Texas high school, students 1,000 miles away in Iowa are rethinking their daily routines, particularly in the school cafeteria. Calysta Wilson and Courtney Fletcher, both juniors at Mount Pleasant Community High School, are concerned about their usual table, which is closest to the cafeteria doors.\n\n\"We sit at the table closest to the doors,\" Calysta, 17, said during a softball game. \"In the case that you came in as a shooter and you killed the first person you saw, I would die. I would not make it.\"\n\nAs the reality of school violence sinks in, conversations among many high school students have shifted from \"This could never happen here\" to \"What do we do when this happens?\" Students who have grown up with the persistence of mass shootings and are versed in active shooter drills often think about the possibility of a shooting in their schools, whether they are in English or history class. They routinely consider the safety of their classrooms, even running scenarios in their heads about how likely they are to get shot.\n\nSince the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting nearly six years ago in Newtown, Connecticut, there have been more than 200 school shootings nationwide, including the recent rampage in Parkland, Florida, which inspired a youth-led movement to reform gun laws.\n\nStudents now discuss the location of doors and windows in their classrooms as risk factors, calculate escape routes, and ponder hiding spots in wide-open rooms. \"It's like the front lines of a war,\" said Emily Rubinstein, a sophomore at a New York high school. \"Being seated in front of the classroom could be what makes you live and what makes you die.\"\n\nEmily has given a great deal of thought to her safety as she moves through her school day. She considers her English classroom the safest, as it has just one door, is down a hallway that makes it hard to find, and has an unusual cutout corner with no desks in it. Math class, on the other hand, is where she is most exposed. She sits in the second desk of the second row, in a direct diagonal path from the door. During lockdown drills, she has learned that the safest place to be is pressed up against the wall where the door is, so that if a shooter looks into the room, it will appear empty. However, in math, she has calculated that her chances of reaching that position are low.\n\n\"I sit really, really close to the door,\" she said. \"If someone came running down the hall with a gun, I wouldn't have time.\"\n\nDespite these thoughts, Emily said these plans have not affected her schoolwork, friendships, or her extracurricular activities. \"We have all these thoughts,\" she said. \"But there's still part of my mind that's like, 'No, it couldn't happen to me.'\"\n\nMany schools have decided that it could. A 2016 report from the United States Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of school districts conduct exercises to prepare for an active shooter. Bartlesville High School, an hour north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has regularly held safety drills and lockdowns since 2012, when a student was arrested for making a threat against the school. In Martinsburg, West Virginia, Spring Mills High School held a \"code red\" lockdown this year without telling some teachers the event was just a drill, to make sure the staff was truly prepared.",
    " Title: Biden's Victories in Six Primaries Signal Clear Path to Democratic Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, former Vice President Joe Biden has shown a clear path to the Democratic nomination following his victories in six states on March 10, 2020. The primary contests in Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho, Washington, and North Dakota have solidified Biden's position as the party's front-runner, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders struggling to keep pace.\n\nThe results of Tuesday's primaries indicate that Biden is likely to secure a substantial victory in Florida next Tuesday and win in states like Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona on the same day. This momentum is expected to continue, allowing Biden to amass a significant number of delegates and secure the nomination.\n\nThe polls and the results of Tuesday's contests suggest that Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton's 2016 performance, while Sanders is underperforming. In Michigan, for instance, Sanders, who surprised many by narrowly beating Clinton in the 2016 primary, is on track to lose to Biden by approximately 13 percentage points. Similarly, in Missouri, Sanders, who won the state by a mere 0.2% in 2016, is likely to lose to Biden by a significant 25-point margin.\n\nThe results in other states, such as Idaho and Washington, also show a marked contrast between the 2016 and 2020 primaries. In 2016, Sanders won Idaho's caucuses by 56 points, a lead that has narrowed significantly in 2020, with Biden currently holding a slight lead with over half the vote in. In Washington, Sanders' 72% victory in the 2016 caucuses has been matched by a close race between Sanders and Biden, with two-thirds of the primary votes counted.\n\nThe Sanders campaign's performance in these primaries has been lackluster, leading to a deflating effect. Conversely, the Biden campaign, with no other viable opponents, has gained momentum and is virtually unstoppable in its march towards the Democratic nomination.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden will prove more effective than the 2016 nominee in challenging President Donald Trump in the general election. However, the results of Tuesday's primaries give Democrats reason to believe that Biden may have a better chance of defeating Trump.",
    " Title: Obama to Announce Expanded Background Checks and Enhanced Gun Control Measures in Upcoming Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing gun violence, President Barack Obama is set to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss options for tougher gun restrictions. The President is expected to announce new executive actions in the coming days, with the goal of expanding background checks on gun sales.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the White House plans, the set of executive actions is described as \"imminent.\" These actions are expected to fulfill a promise by the President to take further unilateral steps that the administration claims could help curb gun deaths.\n\nThe exact timing and content of Obama's executive orders have not been confirmed, and those familiar with the process warn that unforeseen circumstances could delay an announcement. However, gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, before Obama's annual State of the Union address, scheduled for January 12.\n\nThe White House has declined to comment directly on the specifics of Obama's executive orders. White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated that the President expects a set of recommendations on unilateral action to arrive at the beginning of the year.\n\nPlans for the action became clearer on New Year's Day with a White House announcement accompanying Obama's weekly address. In his address, Obama emphasized the need for change, stating, \"The gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids.\"\n\nThe focus of the new executive actions is expected to be on the so-called \"gun show loophole,\" which allows certain sellers of guns\u2014at gun shows and elsewhere\u2014to avoid conducting background checks before making sales. The White House is reportedly considering expanding the background check requirement to additional sellers, as well as providing expanded guidance on who falls under the \"in the business\" standard.\n\nGun control advocates and White House officials are also pushing for new funding for government agencies to better enforce existing gun laws and for tighter regulations on the reporting of lost and stolen guns. The administration is expected to tighten requirements by reducing the minimum number of guns stolen that would prompt an investigation, and potentially eliminating the requirement that one of the guns is used in a crime.\n\nAside from the background check provision, people familiar with Obama's plans say his new gun control announcement will include new funding for government agencies to better enforce existing gun laws. Other gun control advocates are pushing the administration to set an annual sales threshold of 25 guns for a seller to be defined as \"engaged in the business\" of selling guns, and thus required to obtain a license and conduct background checks.\n\nBefore leaving for his winter vacation in Hawaii, Obama met with Michael Bloomberg at the White House to discuss gun control. Aside from the background check provision, the Michael Bloomberg-helmed Everytown for Gun Safety has provided recommendations to the White House that include creating a test for assessing who must become licensed to continue selling guns, as well as defining a gun in a \"personal collection\" as having been in the seller's possession for at least a year.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has not commented on the President's new gun control measures. In the past, the group has criticized Obama's gun control agenda, stating that it would make it harder for law-abiding citizens to exercise their right to self-defense.",
    " Title: Mississippi Elementary School Renamed in Honor of Former President Barack Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic move, a predominantly black elementary school in Jackson, Mississippi, has been renamed after the first black president, Barack Obama. The Davis International Baccalaureate (IB) Elementary School, which was previously named after Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, will bear the name of Obama starting from the 2018-19 school year.\n\nThe decision was made following a vote by school stakeholders on October 5, announced by PTA President Janelle Jefferson at a meeting of the district's board of trustees. \"The school community wanted to rename the campus to reflect a person who fully represents ideals and public stances consistent with what we want our children to believe about themselves,\" said Jefferson.\n\nDiscussions to rename the magnet school began in August, with the aim of choosing a name that aligns with the school's diverse student body. More than 95% of the school's students are black. \"Jefferson Davis, although infamous in his own right, would probably not be too happy about a diverse school promoting the education of the very individuals he fought to be enslaved named after him,\" PTA president Jefferson told the board of trustees.\n\nThe renaming process involved suggestions from staff and students, followed by a vote. \"I wholeheartedly agree with the name,\" Board President Camille Simms said at Tuesday's meeting. School board member Jed Oppenheim applauded the school for taking the initiative, stating, \"I think this is a powerful narrative.\"\n\nPTA president Jefferson told the Associated Press that they would conduct \"some very aggressive fundraising campaigns\" to pay for new signs and stationery with Obama's name. The school community looks forward to embracing the new name and the positive influence it represents.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Health Care Decision Alters Public Perception of the High Court\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the national health care law may not have swayed many opinions on the controversial measure, but a new poll indicates it has significantly changed Americans' views of the high court.\n\nAccording to a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday, the public is divided on last week's ruling, with 50% saying they agree with the decision and 49% saying they disagree. The poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday, entirely after the high court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe partisan divide is evident, with more than eight in ten Democrats agreeing with the decision, more than eight in ten Republicans disagreeing, and independent voters divided, with 52% disagreeing and 47% agreeing.\n\nCNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes, \"Despite howls of protest from many Republican leaders, only about one in five Americans - and only 35% of the Republican rank and file - say they are angry about the decision. Despite victory laps by many Democratic leaders, only one in six Americans - and only one in three Democrats nationwide - say they feel enthusiastic about the court's ruling.\"\n\nHowever, perceptions of the high court have changed significantly. \"As recently as April, Republicans and Democrats had virtually identical positive opinions on the Supreme Court. But not any more,\" adds Holland. \"That's the biggest change that the court decision has created.\"\n\nThe court's approval rating among Democrats jumped by 23 points, to 73%. Among Republicans, it fell by 21 points, to 31%. Approval of the Supreme Court among independents edged up five points, to 53%.\n\nOpinions of Chief Justice John Roberts are also divided along partisan lines, with a majority of Democrats holding a favorable view of him compared to only three in ten Republicans. However, more than a third of all Americans are unsure how they view Roberts, probably a result of the low profile that he and his colleagues have kept for many years. Roberts sided with the liberals on the high court to uphold the law.\n\nOverall, three in ten say the high court is too liberal, with 22% saying it's too conservative and 46% saying it's about right.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives has scheduled a July 11th vote to attempt to repeal the health care law. The survey indicates that 51% say Congress should repeal all provisions of the measure, with 47% saying no.\n\nWhat about the individual mandate itself? Forty-eight percent favor it and 51% oppose the mandate. One thing that Americans do agree on is that the health insurance mandate is a tax, as ruled by the Supreme Court. Six in ten feel that way.\n\n\"But it is also worth noting that the number of Americans who favor all or most of the provisions in the bill has gone up a bit since last year, and despite roughly half looking to repeal all the provisions in the law, only one in eight say they oppose everything in the bill,\" says Holland.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from 28-July 1 with 1,517 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.\n\nDo you agree or disagree with Thursday's Supreme Court ruling? Sound off in the comments below.",
    " Title: Michael Flynn's Aborted Nuclear Deal with Saudi Arabia: A Security Arrangement or a Failed Venture?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a proposed plan that never materialized, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was involved in a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia that was more about security than energy, according to Thomas Cochran, a nuclear nonproliferation proponent. The deal, if it had gone through, would have been a significant financial boost for the U.S., Russian, French, and British nuclear industries, as well as the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nHowever, the primary objective was not to generate electricity but to create a security arrangement involving the aforementioned countries. The plan, devised during the Obama administration, aimed to provide the Russian government with a financial lifeline amidst low oil prices. The income generated from the partnership was intended to compensate Moscow for lost military sales to Iran, with the consortium purchasing Russian military hardware in return.\n\nThe deal, if successful, would have potentially encouraged Russia to decrease its support for Iran, in exchange for substantial financial gains not only from nuclear deals but also from arms sales. The nuclear industry, Russia, and Iran would have been the winners, but the Middle East would have become client states to a joint U.S.-Russia protection scheme, with control over their power, weapons, and significant influence on their economies.\n\nThe deal, however, never came to fruition due to several reasons. Firstly, it was during the Obama administration, and Russian sanctions were in place. Secondly, the Iran treaty was in the works, and this plan would have disrupted it significantly. Lastly, the principles involved were not particularly interested.\n\nFlynn's involvement in this deal, along with his numerous other undisclosed associations, has since come under scrutiny. The deal's failure to materialize, coupled with Flynn's failure to disclose his extensive dealings with the Turkish government, dinner with Vladimir Putin, income from Russian state media, payments from a Russian cybersecurity firm, and a researcher's work with Russian hackers, has raised questions about his integrity and transparency.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of disclosure in public service, particularly when dealing with foreign entities. The failure to disclose such associations can have far-reaching implications, potentially compromising national security and undermining public trust.",
    " Title: Texas Senator Ted Cruz Advocates for Texas Senate Bill 1, Citing Fetal Pain and the Founding Principles of the United States\n\nAustin, TX \u2013 U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has publicly expressed his support for Texas Senate Bill 1, a controversial statute that aims to ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and raise the standards of care at abortion clinics by requiring them to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, Sen. Cruz emphasized the importance of protecting the unborn and the impact of the recent murder trial of abortionist Kermit Gosnell. \"I want to thank the thousands of Texans who are engaging in the legislative process to speak up for the unborn,\" Sen. Cruz said.\n\nThe senator's testimony in support of the bill will be read at the Stand for Life Rally on Monday evening at the Texas State Capitol. Cruz argued that the extreme embrace of unlimited late-term abortion is indefensible, citing the nation's founding principles.\n\n\"Our nation was founded on the principle that we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with 'certain unalienable rights,' that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" Sen. Cruz stated. \"Life comes first. Without life, there is no liberty; without life, there is no pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nOver the past week, Sen. Cruz has reflected on the Founding Fathers, the Declaration of Independence, and the concept of natural rights. He believes that the Founders would find legalized infanticide abhorrent and unconscionable.\n\n\"I don't presume to speak for them, but it seems safe to conclude that the Founders would find legalized infanticide abhorrent and unconscionable,\" Sen. Cruz said. \"Women today can terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation in many states. Given what we now know about fetal pain, this is highly problematic -- not to mention barbaric -- for a nation ostensibly 'conceived in liberty' and 'dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,' as Lincoln so nicely put it at Gettysburg.\"\n\nSen. Cruz concluded that liberty and late-term abortion cannot co-exist, and while most Americans seem to understand this, far too many do not. The bill in Texas, championed by pro-lifers, is intended to protect the unborn from agony and death, not to harm women.",
    " Title: U.S. Airstrike Targets Islamic State Militant Known as \"Jihadi John\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has carried out a series of airstrikes against specific militant leaders, including the Islamic State (IS) member known as \"Jihadi John,\" as part of lawful acts of war or self-defense. These strikes are often conducted using missiles fired from drones or warplanes when capturing the militants is not feasible.\n\nThe operations against the Islamic State, which began in 2014, were initially considered part of the armed conflict that Congress authorized against Al Qaeda following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Islamic State was once a component or affiliate of Al Qaeda, but it split away due to internal disagreements.\n\n\"Jihadi John,\" whose real name is Mohammed Emwazi, first gained prominence in August 2014, when the Islamic State released a video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley. Emwazi, who was initially known only as a masked man with a British accent, went on to behead another journalist, Steven J. Sotloff, in a video released two weeks later.\n\nThe Washington Post revealed Emwazi's identity in February 2015, reporting that he grew up in a well-off family that moved to Britain when he was a child and that he had studied computer science at the University of Westminster. This revelation sparked intense scrutiny of the causes of radicalization among Muslim immigrants in Europe.\n\nEmwazi was part of a group of friends, known as the \"North London Boys\" by some intelligence analysts, who prayed at the same mosque and became captivated by an Egyptian-born cleric, Hani al-Sibai. Sibai is thought to have close links to the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Shariah, a Salafist group linked to a deadly attack in June on tourists in Tunisia.\n\nThe leader of this network was Bilal al-Berjawi, who was stripped of his British citizenship in 2011 after he went to Somalia to join the Islamist group known as the Shabab. Berjawi was killed by an American drone strike the following year. Another friend, Mohamed Sakr, was also killed by a drone strike in Somalia in the same year.",
    " Title: The Impact of Ongoing Protests on the Presidential Race: A Neutral Analysis of Trump and Biden's Stances on Police Violence and Criminal Justice Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation grapples with the ongoing protests against police violence, the upcoming presidential race is expected to be significantly influenced by the unrest. The impact on the race, however, remains uncertain, with many political analysts predicting a potential advantage for former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe prognosticators' perspective is understandable, given their allegiance to the political establishment, which generally views President Donald J. Trump with contempt. They perceive the unrest as a manifestation of persistent discontent among racial and ethnic minorities, who they believe will mobilize in large numbers to oust the incumbent president.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider several factors before making such assumptions. Firstly, it is still early in the election cycle, and polls, while informative, are not always accurate, especially in the current lockdown environment. Secondly, the narrative that whites are disproportionately killed by the police is not entirely accurate. While more whites are killed by the police each year, the number of officer-involved shootings is down across the board.\n\nThe discussion on police violence and racial disparities in law enforcement is incomplete without addressing the roles of the two presidential candidates. In this regard, Joe Biden, who has been largely absent from the public eye, has not stepped up to the role of a healer, as his supporters claim he can be. His silence on the matter is particularly striking, given his long political career and his central role in the passage of the 1994 Crime Bill.\n\nThe 1994 Crime Bill, for which Biden was a key architect, is widely criticized for contributing to mass incarceration in the United States. A 2019 report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University law school states that the federal dollars allocated to states and communities in that legislation \"helped buttress mass incarceration for years.\"\n\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, has championed criminal justice reform, leading efforts to balance the books by freeing people of color who were incarcerated for long periods due to minor drug offenses. The First Step Act, a significant part of Trump's criminal justice reform agenda, has provided a second chance to many individuals.\n\nAs the nation's views on race and crime evolve, it is essential for both candidates to address their roles in shaping the criminal justice system. The election will likely hinge on how each candidate plans to address police violence, racial disparities in law enforcement, and criminal justice reform. In the meantime, it is hoped that Joe Biden will emerge from his COVID-19 bunker to engage in meaningful dialogue and action on these critical issues.",
    " Title: \"Obama Administration's Unprecedented Expansion of Executive Power: A Shift in Interpretation of Presidential Authority\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican party expressed optimism, anticipating a shift in bipartisan cooperation from the Obama Administration. However, the reality has deviated significantly from these expectations. Instead of engaging in legislative reform, the Obama Administration has opted to bypass Congress and implement policies through executive action.\n\nThis approach has been evident in various policy areas, including the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the DREAM Act, and No Child Left Behind. The Administration's strategy, as a White House official stated, is to pursue policy goals \"in the most effective and appropriate way possible.\"\n\nIn February 2011, the Justice Department announced it would not defend DOMA against court challenges, a move that is unusual for the agency, which typically defends legal challenges to laws on the books. This tactic has roots that trace back to the earliest days of the administration, with the Department of Justice announcing in October 2009 that it would not prosecute medical marijuana users or suppliers in states where it is legal, despite state laws contradicting federal law.\n\nThis expansion of executive power, once a concern for progressives, has become a hallmark of the Obama Administration. Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, quoted by Friess, notes that \"President Obama has fulfilled the dream of an imperial presidency that Richard Nixon strived for... this is a President who is now functioning as a super legislator.\"\n\nProgressives, who once criticized George W. Bush's expansion of executive power, have largely supported President Obama's unilateral power expansions, from drone strikes that kill American citizens to recess appointments done without a recess. However, they should consider the potential consequences of these powers in the hands of \"the other side.\"\n\nImagining a Republican president who announces that his Environmental Protection Agency is going to halt enforcement of pollution regulations, or a Republican IRS that does not enforce the Obamacare mandate, highlights the potential dangers of such an expansion of executive power.\n\nProgressives should be mindful of what they wish for, as they have cheered President Obama's unilateral power expansions every step of the way. It is crucial to reflect on the implications of these powers in the hands of different political ideologies.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Express Hope for Supreme Court to Alter or Overturn ACA, According to New York Times and CBS News Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The New York Times and CBS News has revealed that more than two-thirds of Americans hope the Supreme Court will overturn some or all of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The poll, which was conducted between May 31 and June 3, surveyed 976 adults with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nJust 24 percent of respondents said they hoped the court would keep the entire health care law in place. In contrast, 41 percent of those surveyed said the court should strike down the entire law, while another 27 percent said the justices should overturn only the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThese numbers have remained relatively stable in recent months and appear to be unaffected by the six-hour-long arguments in the Supreme Court in March. The poll also showed greater Republican opposition to the law than Democratic support. About two-thirds of Republicans in the recent survey said the entire law should be overturned, while 43 percent of Democrats said all of the law should be upheld.\n\nMore than 70 percent of independent voters said they wanted to see some or all of the law struck down, with a majority saying they hoped to see the whole law overturned. Twenty-two percent of independents said they hoped the entire law would survive.\n\nResponses varied by education as well. Nearly a third of respondents with a college education said they would like to see the law upheld, compared with about 20 percent of those without a college degree.\n\nLegal scholars and political scientists are divided over whether the justices take account of public opinion in making their decisions. In a 2010 study published in The Georgetown Law Journal, Lawrence Baum of Ohio State University and Neal Devins of the College of William & Mary concluded that the justices were not much concerned with mass opinion.\n\n\"Supreme Court justices care more about the views of academics, journalists, and other elites than they do about public opinion,\" they wrote. \"This is true of nearly all justices and is especially true of swing justices, who often cast the critical votes in the court's most visible decisions.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide a challenge to the law by the end of this month. The nationwide poll is based on telephone interviews conducted May 31 through June 3 on land-lines and cellphones with 976 adults.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Blocks Enforcement of Louisiana Abortion Law, Potential Implications for Abortion Rights Nationwide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a stay on Thursday, halting the enforcement of a Louisiana abortion law that could have far-reaching implications for abortion rights across the United States. The case, June Medical Services v. Gee, concerns a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n\nThe ruling on Thursday blocks enforcement of the law while the Court considers whether to hear the case. If the Court does hear June Medical Services v. Gee, it could provide an opportunity for the justices to revisit and potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights challenged the Louisiana law on behalf of abortion providers, and in September 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the law to stand, breaking with Supreme Court precedent. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court and asked for a stay of the law, which was supposed to go into effect on February 4. Last week, Justice Samuel Alito issued an order blocking the law until this Thursday.\n\nThe ruling on Thursday was a 5-4 decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the Court's four more liberal members. Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch voted to allow the law to go into effect. The ruling was a victory for abortion rights advocates, albeit a temporary one.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has stepped in under the wire to protect the rights of Louisiana women,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement to media outlets. \"The three clinics left in Louisiana can stay open while we ask the Supreme Court to hear our case.\"\n\nLaws requiring admitting privileges have proliferated around the country in recent years. Abortion opponents have argued that these laws are necessary to protect women's health, but courts have generally failed to find evidence for this. Abortion is generally a safe procedure for the patients who undergo it, and they typically do not need to be admitted to a hospital.\n\nMoreover, abortion providers do not need to have admitting privileges for their patients to visit a hospital. As Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in an opinion striking down a Wisconsin admitting privileges law, \"A woman who experiences complications from an abortion (either while still at the clinic or at home afterward) will go to the nearest hospital, which will treat her regardless of whether her abortion doctor has admitting privileges.\"\n\nSome abortion opponents say laws like Louisiana's ensure women a seamless experience if they do suffer complications. Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that when she had an abortion herself, \"I thankfully did not have any kind of emergency there at the clinic. But had I had, I would have wanted a smooth transfer procedure in place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the laws have resulted in abortion clinic closures, as it's often difficult for abortion providers to obtain hospital admitting privileges. That's a concern for opponents of the Louisiana law, which, according to Travis Tu, lead counsel on the case for the Center for Reproductive Rights, would turn Louisiana into \"an abortion desert.\" It would close at least two of the three remaining clinics in Louisiana, a state with 1 million women of reproductive age, Tu said.\n\nIn Whole Woman's Health, the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas admitting privileges law was unconstitutional, finding that it \"provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so.\" The Louisiana law is nearly identical to the Texas law, but in September, the Fifth Circuit upheld the Louisiana version, essentially placing itself in direct conflict with the Supreme Court. The Center for Reproductive Rights appealed, asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nNow that the Court has stopped enforcement of the law, it must decide whether to hear the appeal. If it decides not to take the case, the stay issued on Thursday would end automatically, and the law would go into effect. If the Court does decide to take the case, it will have to decide whether to follow the precedent set in Whole Woman's Health, striking down the Louisiana law, or reverse itself and uphold the law. In the process, it could decide to overturn the protection for abortion rights set forth in Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhole Woman's Health was decided when Justice Anthony Kennedy, typically seen as a moderate, was still on the Court. Now he's been replaced by Kavanaugh\u2014who, while he refused to directly answer questions about Roe during his confirmation hearing, is seen by advocates on both sides as a potential deciding vote to overturn the landmark abortion decision.\n\nKavanaugh issued an opinion dissenting from Thursday's decision to issue the stay. He argued that the Louisiana law should be allowed to take effect to allow abortion providers to determine if they could, in fact, obtain admitting privileges. Then, if they could not, he said, they could file another challenge to the law.\n\n\"In order to resolve the factual uncertainties presented in the stay application about the three doctors' ability to obtain admitting privileges, I would deny the stay,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I was pleased to see the dissent from Justice Kavanaugh,\" said Foster, noting that he was under no obligation to weigh in publicly.\n\n\"As Justice Kavanaugh said, the question presented to us at this time is whether the law imposes an undue burden,\" she added. \"That's the analysis he's looking towards.\"\n\nIf the Court agrees to hear June Medical Services v. Gee, advocates on both sides will be watching Kavanaugh closely, as the future of abortion law in America may be at stake.",
    " Title: \"Trump's Legal Dramas and the Midterms: A Missed Opportunity for Democrats?\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the ongoing legal investigations involving President Donald Trump have dominated headlines and captivated the media since April 2018. The New York Times' publication of a list of topics that special counsel Robert Mueller would like to question the president about has led to an exclusive focus on the two major legal matters in which Trump is entangled: the Mueller probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Southern District of New York's investigation into Trump attorney Michael Cohen's business dealings, including with Stormy Daniels.\n\nHowever, this fascination with Trump's legal travails has not been beneficial for the Democratic Party looking towards the midterms. While the president's legal dramas have been good for ratings, they have done little to benefit the political opposition. On the contrary, President Trump's approval rating has been on the upswing, standing at 44 percent approval in the Real Clear Politics average, his highest rating in a year.\n\nMeanwhile, since December, the Democratic advantage on the congressional generic ballot has been cut in half, from plus 13 points to plus 6.5 points. In a new survey, pollsters for Democracy Corps and Women's Voices Women's Vote Action Fund, while optimistic about Democratic chances in the fall, nonetheless concede that the party's \"momentum has stalled in the last few months.\"\n\nThe American electorate has not fundamentally changed since the Clinton presidency, with voters holding a \"bifurcated view\" that separates the man from his policies. As long as the policies seem to be working, the man's opponents find themselves waiting in frustration for voters to recognize and repudiate defects of character that are all too plain to see.\n\nTrump became president despite majority personal disapproval. His victory depended on a coalition between his devoted fans and more traditional Republican voters who, despite misgivings, supported him because they concluded that the alternative was worse personally and politically. Evaluations of his character are now \"priced in\" to the electoral market. That is why NBC News/Survey Monkey found this week that Republicans who say Trump is dishonest support him anyway.\n\nThe incessant spotlight on the lawyers, on their clients and subjects and targets, not only occupies the attention of Democrats and the anti-Trump Resistance to the exclusion of other topics. It also relieves them of any responsibility to come up with a substantive message. The voters, by contrast, read the headlines with a cursory or prurient interest as they go about their lives in the real world of work, family, community, and faith.\n\nOne voter told me the other day that legal terminology makes her eyes glaze over; she'd much rather browse Instagram. But such terminology is all anyone speaks in Washington nowadays\u2014even if most pundits are not lawyers, probably couldn't get into law school, and make up for their lack of expertise and inside knowledge with hyperbole and speculation.\n\n\"In the past few months,\" write the authors of the Democracy Corps poll, \"Democrats have appeared less focused on the economic and health-care battles that most engage anti-Trump voters; at the same time, Republican base voters, especially white working-class men, could finally point to a signature conservative policy achievement in the new tax cut law, where before they were grasping for news to justify their vote.\"\n\nIs it any wonder that Democrats appear less focused on the issues that engage voters, when the most prominent spokesmen for the party are Adam Schiff and his mannequins on the House Intelligence Committee, and Richard Blumenthal and Ron Wyden on the Senate side? When Michael Avenatti is on television to such an extent that by the end of this process he won't just have his own show, but probably his own network?\n\nI take exception with Democracy Corps' analysis on one point. The tax bill passed in December, yet Trump's approval began its most recent rise in March. That is exactly when he announced, against the wishes of some of his own advisers and the Republican Congress, his first round of steel and aluminum tariffs. It is Trump's desire to combat offshoring and deindustrialization, more than the tax bill, which is galvanizing his base and strengthening his economic message. More even than immigration, trade and manufacturing were the issues that distinguished Trump from elites in both parties and won him a mass majority of white voters without college degrees.\n\nCollege-educated voters and suburban women disgusted with Trump may be enough to win the Democrats a slim House majority. But Democrats won't find themselves in a truly commanding position until they make inroads among the Rust Belt voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton for the president. The more the party focuses on Robert Mueller and Stormy Daniels, the less likely it is to recognize the appeal of Trump's economic message and to adjust accordingly. The more the party falls for the self-flattery, empty rhetoric, question begging, and maze-like complexity of media narratives\u2014not to mention the more it succumbs to the fever-dream of impeachment\u2014the less likely it is to recoup the power it once enjoyed.",
    " Title: Congressman Charlie Rangel Criticizes Tea Party as a \"Cult\" and Questions Repeal of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Representative Charlie Rangel (D-NY) expressed his disapproval of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, particularly the Tea Party movement. The congressman, who has been in office since 1971, referred to the Tea Party as a \"cult-type of group of people\" and questioned their actions in repealing laws, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nDuring a speech, Rangel stated, \"When a handful of people can control a larger number of people, to repeal a law that has been passed by the House, the Senate, and declared constitutional by the courts - and they campaign on the issue that it should be repealed- this is past Civics 101. This is illness.\"\n\nRangel's comments have sparked controversy and debate, with some interpreting his words as an attack on the Tea Party movement. In response to Rangel's characterization of the Tea Party as a \"cult,\" some have argued that the term is a misrepresentation of the movement, which is made up of like-minded individuals who have come together for political clout.\n\nThe Tea Party movement, like other political ideologies, has been a significant force in American politics, advocating for limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free-market principles. Rangel's comments have been criticized as an attempt to discredit the movement and its supporters.\n\nIn addition to his criticism of the Tea Party, Rangel also questioned the constitutionality of Obamacare, stating that the individual mandate was a \"massive tax increase\" rather than a mandate for commercial engagement. However, it is important to note that the Supreme Court has ruled Obamacare constitutional, and there are ongoing legal challenges to the law.\n\nRangel's comments have been met with criticism from both sides of the political aisle, with some arguing that his words are a reflection of the growing polarization in American politics. Some have also pointed out that Rangel's own ethics violations and use of taxpayer funds for personal gain make him an unlikely critic of others' actions.\n\nIn conclusion, Representative Charlie Rangel's recent comments regarding the Tea Party and Obamacare have sparked controversy and debate. While some may view his words as an attack on the Tea Party movement, others see them as a reflection of the growing polarization in American politics. Regardless of one's political leanings, it is important to approach political discourse with an open mind and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue.",
    " Title: FBI Warns of Zoombombing Incidents as Zoom's Popularity Soars\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing platforms have become a necessity for millions of people worldwide. Among these platforms, Zoom has seen a significant surge in popularity, with the company reporting 200 million daily users in March, up from just 10 million in December. However, this newfound popularity has brought about a darker side, as the FBI has issued a warning about Zoombombing incidents.\n\nDennis Johnson, a doctoral student at California State University, Long Beach, recently fell victim to such an incident during a Zoom videoconference for his dissertation defense. Johnson, who was the first member of his family to graduate from college, let alone earn a doctorate, was in the middle of presenting when an intruder hijacked the call and posted hate speech and offensive images.\n\nThe attacker drew male genitalia on the screen and scrawled a racial slur that everyone on the call could see. Johnson, who was initially unsure of what was happening, was left shaken and unable to communicate for some time after the incident.\n\nZoombombing incidents have disrupted various meetings, including Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in New York, Sunday school in Texas, online classes at the University of Southern California, and a city meeting in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nAs schools close and millions of people work from home, Zoom has become a go-to platform for virtual meetings. However, the FBI has received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language. The bureau's Boston office issued a warning, stating, \"The FBI has received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language.\"\n\nIn response to these concerns, Zoom has taken steps to address them. The company published a guide last month on how users can protect meetings and changed settings for accounts used by schools and universities to make their meetings more private by default. New York Attorney General Letitia James has also sent a letter to Zoom asking about its security and privacy protections.\n\nSecurity researchers have found flaws in Zoom's software that could allow hackers to spy through a computer's webcam or microphone. Zoom says it has released fixes for these issues.\n\nPatrick Wardle, a security researcher who previously worked at the National Security Agency, expressed concerns about Zoom's track record, stating, \"This product was designed to prioritize things other than privacy and security.\"\n\nIn a blog post, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan acknowledged the company's shortcomings and stated, \"We recognize that we have fallen short of the community's \u2013 and our own \u2013 privacy and security expectations.\" Yuan also announced that the company is freezing work on new features to focus on fixing its privacy and security problems.\n\nAs more people rely on Zoom and other video conferencing platforms for their daily activities, it is essential to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to protect oneself and one's information.",

This marks the first step towards cooperation between the two nations since its closure, following a series of steps in the opposite direction.\n\nPyongyang had previously rejected all offers to discuss reopening the Kaesong industrial complex. Analysts suggest that North Korea's change of heart may indicate a growing sense of isolation, particularly from China, a key ally that has shown signs of frustration with North Korean intransigence and has warmed up to US-led efforts to isolate Pyongyang.\n\nAccording to the International Crisis Group's senior analyst, Daniel Pinkston, North Korean and Chinese officials met last month, and China may not have been as generous as North Korea had expected in terms of aid, trade, and investment. Jo Dong Ho, a North Korean Studies professor at Ewha Womans University, stated that the North's conciliatory gesture is earlier than anticipated, and it seems that they are more desperate to boost the economy than expected.\n\nThe timing of Pyongyang's announcement coincides with US-China talks scheduled for later this week. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University, suggested that North Korea is making it easier for China to persuade the US to soften its stance on Pyongyang. Kim Yong Hyun, a Seoul-based professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University, noted that the scheduled meeting of Obama and Xi Jinping is an important factor in understanding this gesture.\n\nChina's stance on North Korea has reportedly become tougher, with China supporting tighter United Nations sanctions in response to the February nuclear test and stepping up border inspections. Notably, a leading Chinese state bank has closed accounts of North Korea\u2019s Foreign Trade Bank, its main foreign exchange institution.\n\nTwo weeks ago, China hosted a top North Korean envoy, a visit that was expedited in advance of the U.S.-China summit. Since then, the North has adopted a less confrontational stance and declared a willingness to return to the negotiating table.\n\nChinese academics are increasingly open to discussing the prospect of a North Korean collapse, a topic that was once considered taboo. However, China is not taking steps that could hasten the end of the Kim regime, such as cutting supplies.\n\nIf the talks take place, they will be the first direct government-to-government meetings between the two countries since February 2011. The North has preferred private talks through nongovernmental channels, but the South has been insistent on government-to-government talks.\n\nAll outstanding issues that have strained cross-border relations will be on the table, including the disconnection of the hotline between the North and South earlier this year. The Associated Press reports that North Korea's acceptance of talks via a statement in state media was its first public response to the South's offer of talks on Kaesong in April.\n\nThe closure of the complex came on the heels of tightened UN sanctions after North Korea's third nuclear test in February and the holding of regular US-South Korea military drills. The North pulled its 50,000 workers from the complex and blocked deliveries. South Korean workers eventually departed as well.\n\nAgreeing to talks could indicate that \"the cost of closure of Kaesong is greater than [the North] had anticipated,\" said Mr. Pinkston. Launched during the \"sunshine\" era of North-South engagement as a symbol of cooperation, it provides inexpensive labor for South Korean companies and critical foreign currency for isolated North Korea, largely shut out of the global financial system by sanctions.\n\n\"There's political symbolism, economic aspects, and nationalistic Pan-Korean elements wrapped up in it as well. The loss if Kaesong is not reopened is more than material,\" Pinkston said in an interview with the Guardian.",
    " Title: Anonymous Senior Official in Trump Administration Criticizes President's Leadership in Op-Ed for New York Times\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - In an unprecedented move, an anonymous senior official in President Donald Trump's administration has written an opinion piece for the New York Times, criticizing the President's leadership and describing efforts to protect the country from his \"worst impulses.\"\n\nIn the column, the official described \"early whispers\" among members of Trump's Cabinet to take steps to remove him as President, but added they decided against it to avoid a constitutional crisis. The official wrote that the root of the problem was that Trump is amoral and not moored to any discernible principles that guide his decision-making.\n\nAsked about the column during a White House event, Trump called it a \"gutless editorial,\" bashed the New York Times as \"failing,\" and ticked off economic achievements that he said were proof of his leadership. The Republican President later fired off a one-word message on Twitter: \"TREASON?\"\n\nIn another tweet, he said: \"If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a visit to India, said he was not the author of the memo. \"I come from a place where if you're not in a position to execute the commander's intent, you have a singular option, that is to leave,\" he told reporters at an impromptu briefing at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi.\n\n\"And this person instead, according to the New York Times, chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do,\" Pompeo added.\n\nThe Times took what it called the rare step of publishing an opinion column by the senior administration official under an agreement to keep the author's name secret. It said the senior administration official's job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.\n\nThe article further fueled accusations by critics that Trump was unstable and unfit for the presidency, and seemed likely to resurrect talk among some Democrats about potentially impeaching the President should they take control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November elections.\n\nThere was an immediate guessing game in Washington about who wrote the article and whether it came from someone within the White House or in another government agency.\n\nThe opinion piece followed publication on Tuesday of the first excerpts from a book by famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward describing chaos in the White House. Woodward reported that Defense Secretary James Mattis rejected a recommendation from Trump for the U.S. military to kill Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to excerpts published by the Washington Post.\n\nMattis dismissed the book as \"a uniquely Washington brand of literature,\" and Trump has called it \"total fiction.\"\n\nIn the Times piece, the official wrote: \"Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the Cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the President.\"\n\n\"But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until \u2014 one way or another \u2014 it's over,\" the author added.\n\nUnder the 25th Amendment, adopted in 1967, the Vice President and a majority of either Cabinet officials or \"such other body as Congress may by law provide\" may declare in writing that the President \"is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" It has never been used to strip a President from power and would be a complicated process.\n\n\"We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\" the writer said. \"But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the President continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Debate Military Intervention in Syria as Tensions Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Syria's accusation of Israel, a close U.S. ally, for launching rockets into the country, American lawmakers have expressed varying opinions on whether the United States should supply Syrian rebel forces with weapons.\n\nSen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, argued that President Barack Obama should have intervened militarily a long time ago, stating, \"The whole situation is becoming more and more expansive, and unfortunately, the red line that the president of the United States had written was apparently written in disappearing ink.\"\n\nThe Obama administration recently acknowledged evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, a \"red line\" Obama had previously established. However, the president has expressed a desire to gather all the facts before taking any action.\n\nSen. McCain suggested establishing a \"safe zone\" in Syria, taking out the Syrian government's air assets, supplying the rebel forces with the necessary weapons, and avoiding American boots on the ground.\n\nRep. Peter King, former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, expressed concerns about arming the rebel forces, fearing they could end up in the wrong hands and potentially strengthen al Qaeda elements.\n\nSen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, agreed that some groups within the rebel movement include radical elements, while also acknowledging the U.S. has already provided hundreds of millions of dollars in refugee aid and anti-aircraft equipment to Turkey.\n\nRep. Tom Cotton, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, felt more strongly, stating that arming the rebels is \"something that should have been done months ago.\"\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested the U.S. could be \"hugely helpful\" by providing intelligence and training, but not boots on the ground.\n\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, agreed with Obama in waiting for all the facts and advocated for a coalition approach to any further efforts.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest stated that the president supports Israel's right to protect its people, but no definitive decision on supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels has been made.",
    " Title: Hundreds of Workers Arrested in Mississippi Immigration Raids at Food-Processing Plants\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal immigration officials, under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), conducted coordinated raids on seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi on Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of approximately 680 individuals believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nThe raids, which involved more than 600 ICE agents, targeted plants near Jackson, with the majority of the plants owned by five companies, according to The Associated Press. Among the plants raided were facilities owned by Koch Foods Inc. and Peco Foods Inc.\n\nKoch Foods Inc., a U.S. poultry processor with more than 13,000 employees, bills itself as one of the largest poultry processors in the country. Forbes ranks it as the 135th largest privately held company in the U.S., with an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune. Peco Foods Inc., the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S., was also among the plants raided.\n\nNo representatives from either company responded to requests for comment. The arrested workers were transported to a local Mississippi National Guard hangar for interviews regarding their immigration status, including whether they had existing deportation orders.\n\nJulia Sol\u00f3rzano, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, stated, \"Today's raids are part of the ongoing war against immigrant families and the communities in which they live.\" She added, \"It is especially sickening that days after immigrants were targeted by a gunman in El Paso, Texas, workers at plants across Mississippi witnessed armed agents descending on their workplace.\"\n\nThe size of the raid operation recalls a similar incident in 2008, when over 400 unauthorized workers were arrested in a meatpacking facility in Iowa under the George W. Bush administration.",
    " Title: Partisanship and the Iran Nuclear Deal: How Netanyahu's Speech to Congress Could Alter U.S.-Israel Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address to Congress has highlighted the role of partisanship in shaping U.S. foreign policy, particularly in relation to the Iran nuclear deal. The speech, which has been criticized for its potential to disrupt the bipartisan consensus on the issue, has led to a rift in the traditionally strong U.S.-Israel relationship.\n\nNetanyahu's decision to accept an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) without notifying the White House or the State Department has been widely criticized, even by conservative media outlets. The move has been seen as a direct challenge to President Obama, further escalating the prime minister's longstanding disdain for the president.\n\nThe controversy deepened when Netanyahu rejected an invitation from Democratic Senators Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) for a private meeting with Democrats. Netanyahu's rejection was seen as a move to avoid the perception of partisanship, but it has only served to exacerbate the issue.\n\nThe fallout from this controversy has potential implications for the Iran nuclear deal, which is a key foreign policy priority for President Obama. The deal, aimed at curbing Iran's controversial nuclear program, has faced opposition from both Republicans and staunch pro-Israel members of the president's own party. The situation has been so severe that, as recently as January, Obama faced the possibility of a united Congress overriding his veto for the first time in his presidency.\n\nHowever, the situation appears to have changed. By aligning himself so publicly with the Republican party, Netanyahu may have made it impossible for Democrats to join the Republicans in their efforts to pass additional sanctions on Iran and override a presidential veto. As Dov Zakheim writes at Foreign Policy, \"Netanyahu's determination to address Congress has all but destroyed any chance the Hill's passing new sanctions and overriding a presidential veto. The deal will therefore go ahead.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has responded to Netanyahu's speech with a series of public moves, including the decision not to meet with Netanyahu and the potential absence of key administration officials at the annual summit of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby. This week, National Security Advisor Susan Rice described Netanyahu's speech as \"destructive\" to U.S.-Israel relations, a strong condemnation that goes beyond typical diplomatic language.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry further escalated the situation during his testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, reminding everyone of Netanyahu's support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. This association of Netanyahu with the divisive foreign policy issue of the last generation is likely to be damaging, given the strong anti-Iraq War sentiment among rank-and-file Democrats.\n\nThe developments in the relationship between the U.S. and Israel are a stark reminder of the power of partisanship in shaping foreign policy. While the impact on the Iran nuclear deal remains to be seen, the controversy has certainly upended the status quo and could have significant consequences for U.S.-Israel relations moving forward.",
    " Title: Congressional Absences at Trump's Inauguration: A Statement of Resistance and Dissent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, a significant number of congressional representatives have announced their decision to skip the event, choosing instead to engage in activities aimed at countering the Trump administration's policies.\n\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, when asked about the appropriateness of President Trump's Twitter posts in light of the biography and record of some of the absent congressmen, stated that the president-elect \"has the right to defend himself\" and that Trump's tweets were intended to highlight Democratic policy failures in American cities. The Trump transition team declined to provide further comment.\n\nAmong the congressional representatives who will not attend the inauguration is John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the dean of the House of Representatives. In a statement, Conyers expressed his intention to \"do everything in my power to ensure that accountability is brought to bear on the administration and that the Constitution and our nation's laws are adhered to, as no one is above the law.\"\n\nRepresentative Barbara Lee of California stated that Trump \"has demeaned and insulted the African-American community, and we are going to have to really raise our voices and resist this if these views are going to be reflected in his policies.\"\n\nOther representatives who have announced their absence include Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona, Maxine Waters of California, Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts, William Lacy Clay of Missouri, Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, Jerrold Nadler, and Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of New York, Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio, Earl Blumenauer and Kurt Schrader of Oregon, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin.\n\nTrump's relationship with the black community was already strained before his transition, with only about 8 percent of blacks voting for him on November 8. The relationship seemed further imperiled when Trump appointed Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, as his White House chief strategist, raising concerns about nationalist and racist views potentially influencing the West Wing.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who led a march in Washington on Saturday, attributed the increased turnout at the demonstration to Trump's Twitter posts.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Child Care Affordability Plan in Pennsylvania, Attacks Clinton on 'Deplorables' Remark\n\nAston, Pa. \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visited a key political area Tuesday, the Philadelphia suburbs, to discuss his Child Care Affordability Plan, a proposal aimed primarily at suburban women voters.\n\nThe plan, which Trump dubbed as \"pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker,\" includes allowing parents to deduct child care expenses from their income taxes, guaranteeing six weeks of paid maternity leave, and creating Dependent Care Savings Accounts to help finance various expenses, including childhood development and elderly care.\n\n\"It's pro-family, it's pro-child, it's pro-worker. These are the people we have to take care of,\" Trump told a supportive crowd in Aston, Pa., near Philadelphia.\n\nTrump also criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her \"basket of deplorables\" remark, slamming her both in Pennsylvania and at an earlier rally in Iowa.\n\n\"While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hard-working American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people,\" Trump said in Iowa.\n\nDuring a speech Monday in Baltimore, Trump said, \"You can\u2019t lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign responded with a television ad juxtaposing that comment with Trump's own attacks on voters, including a comment from last year about then-GOP primary rival Ben Carson, who is now a close ally of Trump: \"How stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of this country to believe this crap?\"\n\nMaya Harris, a senior policy adviser for the Clinton campaign, described Trump's child care plan as \"half-baked,\" with financing to come from other programs like unemployment insurance. Harris also criticized Trump's history of disrespecting women in the workplace and his lack of evidence of providing paid family leave or child care to his own employees.\n\nThe Clinton campaign unveiled new radio ads ahead of Trump's Tuesday speech, highlighting what the campaign called her \"lifelong commitment to fighting for children and families.\" Among the Democratic nominee's proposals is a plan to make preschool universal for 4-year-olds.\n\nThe Trump campaign sees Pennsylvania as a key part of its effort to claim the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, though the state has not backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1988. One key to winning Pennsylvania are the suburbs of Philadelphia, including the one in which Trump will discuss his child care plan Tuesday.\n\nCurrent polls give Democratic nominee Clinton an edge in Pennsylvania \u2014 around 6 points, according to the average of polls compiled by the website RealClearPolitics. Some of those same surveys show low marks for Trump among suburban women, one of the targets of Trump's speech in Aston.\n\nThe specifics of Trump's child care proposals, according to the campaign statement, include capped tax deductions for child care expenses for individuals making more than $250,000 and joint filers making more than $500,000. Lower income taxpayers would be eligible for rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit. Trump's proposed Dependent Care Savings Accounts could be financed by tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation, and parents could use them to finance traditional child care, after-school programs, and tuition for private schools, as well as elder care for aged parents.\n\nThe campaign did not provide cost estimates, but indicated that they would be financed through elimination of waste and fraud in current programs.",
    " Title: Michael Brown's Parents File Civil Lawsuit Against Ferguson, Former Officer Darren Wilson\n\nThe parents of Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager who was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer last August, have filed a civil lawsuit against the city, former police chief Thomas Jackson, and the officer, Darren Wilson.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden at the St. Louis County Courthouse on Thursday, alleges that Wilson \"unjustifiably shot and killed\" Brown, using \"an unnecessary and unreasonable\" amount of force. The lawsuit can be read at the St. Louis Public Radio site.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Jackson was responsible for hiring, training, and supervising Wilson. The legal team representing the Brown family has stated that they will not be seeking a specific amount in monetary damages.\n\nIn a statement made after the lawsuit was filed, family attorney Benjamin Crump cited the Ferguson Police Department's internal culture as a contributing factor to Brown's death. \"To this day, we still do not believe that the shooter of an unarmed 18-year-old teenager has never been cross-examined,\" Brown said.\n\nCrump also stated that the family has been seeking a \"thorough independent review\" in which Wilson could potentially be challenged. He added that the legal team expects the civil suit to rely on much of the same evidence presented in state and federal investigations into the police shooting, but will provide a \"more accurate picture of what took place that day.\"\n\nThe investigations into Brown's death did not result in indictments for Wilson. However, a Department of Justice report on the city's police department found \"a pattern of unconstitutional policing.\"",
    " Title: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Faces Tough Decision as Democrats Grapple with Political Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the halls of the United States Senate, the eyes of the nation are on Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, as he navigates a political storm within his own party. On one side, Schumer faces a restless Democratic caucus and a fervent group of activists, funded in part by George Soros, who are demanding he block eight Trump nominees, escalating their opposition in a self-proclaimed \"Resistance.\" On the other, moderate voices within the Democratic caucus urge Schumer to quell the passions and maintain a responsible approach to the confirmation process.\n\nThe political turmoil within the Democratic Party has reached a boiling point, with the delay in concession, recount attempts, and allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Now, the nation watches as Senate Democrats, seven of whom are up for reelection in states won by President Trump, oppose presidential appointments without any pretense of regular order or apology.\n\nThe media is inundated with attacks on nominees from Democrat-funded groups, while Democratic Senators offer outraged sound bites. This political theater has the potential to ignite a media firestorm, but the question remains: What will burn? The Democratic Party, if Schumer does not restore respect for process, or the democratic process itself?\n\nThe Democratic Party finds itself at a critical juncture, with the party losing 1,042 governing seats under President Obama. If the party continues its lurch to the left, it risks becoming a relic of history, much like the Whig Party of the 1850s.\n\nSchumer's decision to either quell the antics of his radical left wing or risk damaging the Democratic brand is a pivotal moment for the party. Americans do not subscribe to extremism or radical responses to electoral loss. If sore-loser-ism leads to anti-democratic behavior, respect for Democrat leadership will be lost, along with shared values, institutional prerogatives, and any hope of restoring a centrist Democrat Party.\n\nSeasoned leadership is not about exacting vengeance or settling scores. It is about abiding by history, demonstrating patience, respecting institutions, comity, and high office. If Schumer succumbs to the radical left, the Democratic Party risks plunging into the wilderness, with the potential for a significant loss in the 2018 and 2020 elections.\n\nSchumer must choose a different path, one that prioritizes a swift and orderly confirmation process for the president's appointees. This is the time for Schumer to make a choice that may determine the Democratic Party's fate for years to come.\n\nAs Robert Frost wrote in his poem \"The Road Not Taken,\" \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\" Schumer should strive to say, \"I shall be telling this with a sigh, somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\"",
    " Title: Life in Seoul Carries On Amidst North Korean Threats: A Study in Resilience\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Seoul, South Korea, the city bustles with life as the winter recedes, and the sun sets over the towering skyscrapers. The city, the second-largest metropolitan area in the world, is a stark contrast to the stream of threats emanating from North Korea. Despite the proximity to the demilitarized zone and the potential threat of a full-scale war, the city's residents seem unfazed, carrying on with their daily lives.\n\nThe city's streets are filled with people, from young girls chatting excitedly on their cell phones to men debating their happy hour destinations. The atmosphere is far from tense, and there is no discernible fear or anxiety in the air. This is not a sign of indifference, but rather a testament to the resilience of the South Korean people, who have lived under the constant threat of North Korea for generations.\n\nIn conversations with local journalists and residents, it became clear that the people of Seoul have grown accustomed to the North Korean threats. They understand that North Korea does not want war, but rather seeks money and food. The North Korean regime has used various tactics, such as missile launches and nuclear threats, to blackmail the South, but the South Korean people remain unperturbed.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who visited Seoul this week, encouraged the South Korean audience to focus on jobs, human dignity, the environment, and poverty reduction. He urged them to look towards a future of democracy and prosperity, rather than being burdened by the dark clouds of threats.\n\nThe resilience of the South Korean people is evident in their daily lives. In the week the author spent in Seoul, he found only one woman who remembered participating in civilian air raid drills 30 years ago. Today, Seoul's 25 million residents have no desire to live in constant fear.\n\nWhile the threat of war is unthinkable in Seoul, it is a very real threat in a select few flashpoint areas. The author, on a street corner near CNN's Seoul offices, contemplated the potential consequences if missiles were to ever come streaking towards the South Korean capital. The nearest shelter would likely be the subway system, but the author's calculations were not comforting.\n\nYet, like everyone around him, the author decided to think about something else. This is a testament to the spirit of the South Korean people, who continue to live their lives, undeterred by the threats from the North. It is a story of resilience, of a people who have learned to carry on despite the challenges they face.",
    " Title: Kathy Griffin Apologizes for Trump Decapitation Art, Sparks National Outcry and Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, comedian Kathy Griffin has issued an apology for her controversial performance art project, which depicted a model of a decapitated head resembling President Donald Trump. The image, which sparked outrage and condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum, may have inadvertently brought Americans together in a show of unity not seen since Trump's unexpected election.\n\nGriffin, known for her provocative and often controversial humor, was inspired by a scene from the popular television series Game of Thrones, which featured the severed head of former President George W. Bush. Producers later apologized for the scene and edited it out of later screenings.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Griffin initially defended her actions, stating, \"Obviously, I do not condone any violence. I'm merely mocking the mocker in chief.\" However, she later deleted these tweets and removed the image from her social media accounts.\n\nThe backlash against Griffin was swift and widespread, with famous and not-so-famous individuals across the political spectrum expressing their disapproval. CNN, where Griffin co-hosts New Year's Eve, announced Wednesday that it had terminated its contract with her.\n\nCNN co-host Anderson Cooper tweeted, \"For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\" President Trump also responded, tweeting, \"Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!\"\n\nFormer First Daughter Chelsea Clinton shared similar sentiments, tweeting, \"This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.\" Actress Debra Messing, a Hillary Clinton supporter, said, \"It wasn't right when people (sic) hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn't right now.\"\n\nEven the Secret Service reacted to Griffin's photo without being specific, stating, \"Threats made against @SecretService protectees receive the highest priority of all our investigations.\"\n\nGriffin, who has a history of crossing lines, seemed genuinely remorseful when she tweeted, \"I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong.\" She admitted that the image was \"too disturbing\" and \"wasn't funny,\" and that she understood \"how it offends people.\"\n\nDave Berg, author of Behind the Curtain: An Insider's View of Jay Leno's Tonight Show, co-produced the show for 18 years.\n\nThe massive backlash on Twitter aimed at Griffin's tasteless stunt might have actually brought the country together to defend President Trump, perhaps for the first time. Even Griffin herself seemed to understand that she had done something very wrong, which is also a first.\n\nShock artists like Griffin are merely poseurs hiding behind the guise of humor while avoiding the hard work of coming up with real thought-provoking comedic material. Instead, they just continuously blur the boundaries of good taste. The social media storm that shut down Griffin represents a small but important step in preserving what little civility we have left.",
    " Title: Libya Faces Political Crisis as Former General Khalifa Haftar Gains Support from Armed Factions\n\nArticle:\n\nA political crisis is unfolding in Libya as a former general, Khalifa Haftar, seems to be gaining allies among armed factions, who are rallying behind him in a self-described campaign to restore stability. The country's interim parliament, dominated by Islamist politicians, and their rivals are forming two distinct camps, with Haftar's forces attacking Islamist militias in Benghazi and claiming responsibility for an attack on the General National Congress (GNC), the parliament's official name.\n\nIn an attempt to diffuse the crisis, acting prime minister Abdullah Al-Thinni has called on the GNC to vote immediately on a 2014 budget and to confirm his successor, the prime minister-elect, before a recess and elections for a new interim legislature. If confirmed, the new premier would be Libya's fifth since the fall of the Qaddafi dictatorship in 2011. However, past changes of leadership have failed to stop interference by powerful militias, and the GNC has been regularly deadlocked since its election in 2012.\n\nTripoli remains tense as residents await the legislators' response to Mr. Thinni's proposal. Foreign embassies are on alert amid fears of widening conflict. Khalid Shteti, who manages the Libya branch of a Turkish construction company, notes that politics is a popular topic of discussion among Libyans. \"Everyone is talking about it,\" he says, \"even in the tax office and in all the caf\u00e9s.\"\n\nThe crisis reflects a rift between Islamist politicians who dominate the GNC and their non-Islamist rivals, but it is also drawing in armed groups who seem to be predominantly motivated by regional ties and opportunism. Last Friday, forces under Mr. Haftar attacked Islamist militias in Benghazi, which he said authorities had failed to rein in. On Sunday, militiamen apparently aligned with Haftar attacked the GNC building in Tripoli.\n\nHaftar has won support from residents of Benghazi who hope he can put an end to a pattern of bombings, shootings, and abductions often blamed on hardline Islamist militias. Powerful militias from the city of Zintan, who reportedly took part in Sunday's attack on the GNC, seem to support Haftar, as does Ibrahim Jadhran, a militia leader in eastern Libya who has seized oil ports to use as leverage to obtain greater regional autonomy.\n\nThe GNC's speaker has summoned other militias, notably from the city of Misrata, to Tripoli to resist what he describes as an anti-democratic power-grab by Haftar's camp. It is unclear whether Misrata militias, which have a history of rivalry with their Zintan counterparts, have entered the city. If the GNC heeds Thinni's appeal to vote without delay on the budget and prime minister from a secret location, it could ease tensions over the interim parliament and help prevent further fighting.\n\nA former cabinet member from Libya's first post-Qaddafi government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautions that Libya will need diplomatic guidance from allies such as the US and the European Union to resolve the crisis. \"Libyan factions are both too weak to make concessions and too weak to impose their will,\" he says. \"Even those who claim to have an ideology don't have political vision.\"\n\nFailure to reach a compromise could push Libya into further bloodshed that might draw in more of the country's armed groups. However, ordinary Libyans have no stomach for fighting, the former cabinet member says. While some residents of Benghazi see in Haftar a possible source of stability, others there remain skeptical of his apparent lack of a long-term agenda for the city and unclear ambitions. \"Is he qualified to run a city?\" says the former cabinet member. \"Does he believe in elections? Would he act with vengeance?\"",
    " Title: U.S. and China Announce Ambitious Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets, Sparking Debate on Climate Change and Economic Impact\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two largest carbon dioxide emitters, unveiled ambitious targets on Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to foster a global agreement on climate change next year.\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced that the U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, a more aggressive target than previously planned and a significant increase from the 17% reduction target set for 2020. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in turn, did not commit to a specific reduction target but pledged to cap China's greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030, while still building coal-burning plants.\n\nPresident Obama described the U.S. goals as \"ambitious,\" stating that the accelerated pace of cuts would improve public health and create jobs. He also praised China for agreeing to \"slow, peak, and then reverse\" its carbon emissions eventually. China is also pledging to obtain about 20% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.\n\nHowever, the feasibility of meeting these targets remains uncertain, and President Obama's pledge is likely to face opposition from Republican lawmakers in Congress. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has been a vocal critic of President Obama's \"war on coal\" and has advocated for cutting funding to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. McConnell described the new targets as \"unrealistic\" and expressed concern that they would lead to higher utility rates and fewer jobs. He also criticized President Obama's policies as \"ideological\" and \"job-destroying red tape.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups, on the other hand, praised the deal, stating that it would create momentum for a global climate-change pact in Paris next year among nearly 200 nations. Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, described the agreement as a \"new day\" for cooperation between the U.S. and China on climate change.\n\nThe deal also included other agreements between the U.S. and China, such as an extension of visa limits for Chinese citizens and an understanding to expand an information technology agreement on the export of electronic goods.\n\nThis article is based in part on wire-service reports.",
    " Title: American Prisoners Freed by North Korea: A Diplomatic Milestone and a Step Towards Denuclearization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant diplomatic milestone, three American prisoners, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak-song, were released by North Korea and returned to the United States on Thursday morning. The prisoners, who were greeted by President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump upon their arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, were escorted back to the U.S. by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe prisoners, who were taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for medical examinations after their meeting with the president and Vice President Mike Pence, were held on charges of espionage or other \"hostile acts\" against North Korea. Two of the men were taken captive last year, while Kim Dong-chul has been detained since 2015. No other Americans are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea.\n\nPresident Trump, addressing the news media covering the event, said, \"I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the three wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting.\" He went on to thank North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for freeing the American hostages.\n\nThe release, largely seen as a goodwill gesture by Kim, could pave the way for a new era of U.S.-North Korea relations after heightened tensions last year saw President Trump and Kim threaten each other with nuclear strikes. The U.S. had long demanded the Korean-American citizens' release.\n\nThe Americans' release came during Pompeo's second visit to North Korea this year. In his latest trip, Pompeo secured the Americans' freedom Wednesday after ensuring stronger ties with North Korea in exchange for the country's promise to desert its nuclear weapons program.\n\nPresident Trump told reporters from the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base that his \"proudest achievement will be when we denuclearize that entire [Korean] peninsula.\" Vice President Pence said in an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that the release of the prisoners signaled a willingness by the North to negotiate in a way that appears \"different\" from past efforts.\n\nThe meeting between Trump and Kim is expected to take place in Singapore, though the White House has yet to reveal further details, and officials cautioned that the president may not yet have given his final approval. The meeting could take place in late May or early June.",
    " Title: Treasury Secretary Geithner's Proposed Temporary Measure to Shield Middle-Class Taxpayers from Potential Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a novel approach to the ongoing tax debate, a creative idea is circulating in Washington D.C., proposing that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner could temporarily shield middle-class taxpayers from potential tax hikes, even if no deal is reached to prevent the expiration of the Bush-era tax rates in January.\n\nThe proposal suggests that Geithner, through adjusting withholding tables for income tax purposes, could maintain the current tax rates for middle-class taxpayers, while allowing tax rates to rise for wealthier taxpayers with annual income exceeding $250,000. This would ensure that middle-class workers' paychecks do not reflect the higher tax rates.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that this proposal does not entail the White House ignoring tax laws or collecting different taxes than those set by Congress. If tax rates increase, taxpayers will still owe the additional amount. The proposal pertains to the Treasury's responsibility for publishing withholding tables, which employers use to determine how much to deduct from workers' paychecks for their taxes.\n\nIn theory, Geithner could keep the withholding tables the same for lower-income workers, making it appear as if their taxes have not increased. However, this approach carries significant risks, as miscalculating the eventual tax rate and withholding the incorrect amount could result in tens of millions of people owing a substantial amount to the IRS when tax day arrives.\n\nIn terms of solving the ongoing tax debate, this plan does not offer a definitive solution. Instead, it represents a potential temporary measure to alleviate the immediate impact of potential tax hikes on middle-class taxpayers. The ultimate resolution of the tax debate will require the cooperation of Congress and the White House to reach a deal on tax rates.",
    " Title: Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 Crashes in French Alps, Officials Call Off Search Operation as Night Falls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, an Airbus A320 aircraft operated by Germanwings, a low-cost subsidiary of Lufthansa, has crashed in the French Alps, with all 150 people on board likely perishing, French officials said. The plane, Flight 4U 9525, was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany.\n\nAs night fell on the area, French authorities called off the search operations, with the complex search operation expected to resume Wednesday morning, according to France 24.\n\nAt a news conference, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann revealed that the plane began descending after reaching its regular height and dropped for eight minutes. The plane's cruising altitude is 38,000 feet, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nWinkelmann stated that the plane lost contact with French radar and French air traffic control at 10:55 a.m. local time when it was at a height of about 6,000 feet. \"We can not say at this point in time why our colleague decided to lower the plane as swiftly as he did,\" Winkelmann said. \"We do not have any information about why he brought the plane down so quickly to a lower height.\"\n\nAt a subsequent news conference in Barcelona's El Prat airport, Heike Birlenbach, a Lufthansa vice president, said, \"For the time being, we say it's an accident. There's nothing more that we can say right now. Everything else would be speculation.\"\n\nEric Heraud, a spokesman for the French Civil Aviation Authority, said the plane did not send out a distress signal, according to The Associated Press. Earlier reports said it had. The AP quoted Heraud as saying a combination of loss of radio contact with control and the plane's descent \"prompted the control service to declare a distress.\" Winkelmann said Germanwings could not confirm a distress signal had been sent.\n\nWinkelmann said Flight 4U 9525 left Barcelona at 10:01 a.m. The aircraft was scheduled to land in Duesseldorf at 11:39 a.m., according to Flightaware.com. He said the aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 and had been operating for Germanwings, a low-cost Lufthansa subsidiary, since 2004. Its last routine check was Monday, he said, in Duesseldorf. Its last major inspection was in the summer of 2013, he said. Winkelmann said the captain who flew the plane was an experienced pilot who had flown for Lufthansa and Germanwings for 10 years.\n\nThe nationalities of the passengers have not been released, pending notification of kin, Germanwings said. However, the Education Ministry in German North Rhine-Westphalia state said 16 high-schoolers and two teachers from a school in Haltern, Germany, were aboard the flight.\n\n\"This is the darkest day in the history of our town,\" Haltern Mayor Bodo Klimpel said.\n\nMourners began streaming into Barcelona's airport just hours after the morning flight took off\u2014but never landed. The Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings has set up a Spanish language hotline for family and friends of those who were on the plane. The Spanish government says roughly a third of the 150 people on board had Spanish surnames.\n\n\"The Spanish king and queen issued their condolences from France. They were in Paris on a state visit, but cut short their trip, and rushed home to Spain,\" the report said.\n\nAt a news conference, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box was located at the site of the crash, and would be used to investigate what caused the plane to go down. The exact location of the crash is unclear, but the terrain where the plane went down is difficult to access, officials said, hampering search efforts.\n\nThe A320 is one of the most popular planes in the world for short- and medium-haul flights. In a statement, Airbus said:\n\n\"The aircraft involved in the accident, registered under D-AIPX was MSN (Manufacturer Serial Number) 147 delivered to Lufthansa from the production line in 1991. The aircraft had accumulated approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights. It was powered by CFM 56-5A1 engines.\"\n\nThe crash is the deadliest in French territory since 1981, when 180 people died in the crash of an Inex-Adria Aviopromet plane at Mount San Pietro. In July 2000, an Air France Concorde flying between Paris and New York crashed during takeoff near Paris, killing 113 people.",
    " Title: Deadly Attack on Sikh Religious Complex in Kabul Ends, 25 Killed, 8 Wounded\n\nArticle:\n\nAfghan forces have concluded a hours-long siege on a Sikh religious complex in Kabul, the Ministry of Interior announced, following an attack that left 25 people dead and eight others wounded. The attack, claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), took place on Wednesday and was initially denied by the Taliban.\n\nAccording to witness Raju Singh Sonny, a man dressed in a police uniform entered the temple in central Kabul, shot a guard, and began attacking worshippers in the main hall. Several other attackers also entered the building and moved from room to room, shooting people.\n\nLater in the day, interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian confirmed that the security forces' operation had ended, and all attackers were killed. The area, located in old Kabul, was cordoned off by security forces after gunmen stormed the complex, as per the government's statement.\n\nNarindra Singh Khalsa, a parliamentarian from the minority Sikh community, was near the Gurdwara \u2013 the Sikh place of worship \u2013 when the attack occurred and ran to the site. Among those killed was a child whose body was brought to a Kabul hospital, as reported by emergency services and the hospital.\n\nMohan Singh, who was in the Gurdwara at the time of the attack, told Associated Press (AP) he first heard the sound of gunshots and sought cover under a table. Later, he heard the sound of explosions, which he believes were hand grenades. He was injured when parts of the ceiling fell on him.\n\nIn photographs shared by the interior ministry, about a dozen children were seen being rushed out of the Gurdwara by Afghan special forces, many of them barefoot and crying.\n\nKhalsa later told Reuters News Agency that many people were still inside the building. \"The gunmen started their attack at a time when the Dharamsala was full of worshippers,\" he said, referring to a sanctuary area in the temple compound.\n\nThe SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors activities by armed groups, reported that ISIL had claimed responsibility for the attack on its Aamaq media arm. Earlier this month, an affiliate of ISIL attacked a gathering of minority Shia Muslims in Kabul, killing 32 people.\n\nThe attack comes a day after the US announced it would cut its aid to the Afghan government by $1bn over frustrations that political leaders could not reach an agreement and form a team to negotiate with the Taliban. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kabul on Tuesday in an attempt to resolve a standoff between President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who also proclaimed himself president following a contested election.\n\nThe US and the Taliban signed a deal last month, which was intended to pave the way for talks between the Afghan leadership and the rebels. However, with Kabul unable to agree on who is in government, the talks have stalled.\n\nSikhs, who number fewer than 300 families, have faced widespread discrimination in the country and have also been targeted by armed groups. In 2018, a suicide bombing targeting the Sikh community and claimed by ISIL killed more than a dozen people in the eastern city of Jalalabad. Under Taliban rule in the late 1990s, Sikhs were asked to identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, but the rule was not enforced. In recent years, large numbers of Sikhs and Hindus have sought asylum in India, which has a Hindu majority and a large Sikh population.",
    " Title: Secretary DeVos Defends School Reopening Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases, Faces Criticism from Political Figures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News Sunday, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos defended the idea of sending children back to school amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and reiterated the administration's stance on withholding federal funds from schools that do not resume in-person classes.\n\nDuring the interview, DeVos stated, \"There's nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous.\" She pointed to several countries that have successfully reopened their schools, including Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nFox News Sunday host Chris Wallace questioned the comparison, stating, \"Is it really fair, is it reasonable to compare the situation in countries that have 20 new cases in a day with a country that has 68,000 new cases in a day?\"\n\nDeVos responded, \"We're talking about schools and other countries' experiences with reopening schools. And it has been shown to be very successful.\" However, Wallace countered, \"Schools happen in an environment. If there's 30 cases in a country, that's very different than a place where it's out of control and there are 70,000 new cases in a day.\"\n\nThroughout the interview, DeVos maintained that the places experiencing a surge in cases were the exception, and when hotspots do appear, they must be \"dealt with differently.\" She also stated that schools that do not reopen should not be eligible for federal assistance.\n\nWallace questioned the legality of withholding federal funds, stating, \"Under what authority are you and the president going to unilaterally cut off funding, funding that's been approved by Congress, and most of the money goes to disadvantaged students or students with disabilities?\"\n\nDeVos responded, \"American investment in education is a promise to students and their families. If schools are not going to reopen and not fulfill that promise, they should not get the funds, and give it to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise.\"\n\nPresident Trump has previously criticized the guidelines on reopening schools issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stating they were \"very tough,\" \"expensive,\" and \"impractical.\" DeVos clarified that the guidelines were only recommendations and were meant to be \"helpful\" for educators determining how to reopen.\n\nDr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Wallace that \"kids are at much lower risk of serious infections than adults, but not zero.\" He also noted that while in some countries, such as Germany and Denmark, the spread of the virus in schools has been \"relatively uncommon,\" in others, such as Israel, there was a large outbreak in schools when they reopened.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized DeVos' comments, stating they amounted to \"malfeasance and dereliction of duty.\" Pelosi added, \"This is appalling. The president and his administration are messing with the health of our children.\" She emphasized the importance of ensuring a safe return to school for students, teachers, and staff.\n\nThe ongoing debate over school reopenings continues as the nation grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on education.",
    " Title: President Trump Orders National Guard Troops Withdrawal from Washington D.C. Amid Ongoing Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, President Donald Trump announced the beginning of the withdrawal of thousands of National Guard troops from Washington D.C., following a weekend of largely peaceful protests against police brutality in the city. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, have been ongoing for over a week.\n\nThe administration defended the president's decision to call up active-duty military forces to stand by in case they were needed to quell the unrest in the streets around the White House. However, the move has faced criticism from Democrats, some of Trump's Republican allies, and other backers, who argue that the show of military force is an inappropriate response to domestic unrest.\n\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered Utah National Guard members out of a hotel near downtown last week, citing budget concerns. Bowser has made it clear that she does not want military-style police patrolling the streets. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Bowser stated, \"I have no ability to evict anybody from a private hotel. We did insist that D.C. residents don't pay the bills for troops we did not request.\"\n\nThe use of National Guard and active-duty military troops to calm the unrest has also faced pushback within the Trump administration, including from Pentagon chief Mark Esper. Esper broke with the president on the issue, stating that the protests do not meet the heightened level to call for military intervention.\n\nAbout 1,600 active-duty military troops were sent to the nation's capital last week after a church and other buildings near the White House were set ablaze, and monuments were tagged with graffiti. However, the troops were not deployed to confront citizens.\n\nActing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf defended the administration's moves, stating that the unrest diminished after the increase in law enforcement presence. Attorney General William Barr also defended the administration's actions, stating that troops should be used as a last resort and that the president has the authority to send troops into states even if state leaders have not requested help.\n\nHowever, Barr also stated that troops should only be deployed as a last resort and that they were not needed during the protests in Washington D.C. The ongoing debate over the use of military forces in response to domestic unrest continues as protests against police brutality and racial inequality continue across the country.",
    " Title: \" Kashmir Tensions, US Presidential Race, and Impeachment Inquiry: A Triple Threat of Controversies\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by international tensions, political maneuvers, and investigative probes, three significant stories have emerged, each with its own complexities and implications.\n\nFirstly, the ongoing conflict in Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, has once again escalated, with both countries being accused of contributing to the continued violence in the region. The left believes that both nations share responsibility for reducing Kashmir to a ruin and destroying generations of Kashmiri lives. The recruitment of young men like Adil Ahmad Dar, a Kashmiri suicide bomber, is seen as a result of structural violence, political repression, and the influence of terrorist groups like Jaish-e-Muhammad.\n\nSecondly, the United States presidential race has seen a focus on policy details, particularly in the Medicare financing plans proposed by the candidates. Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender, has been commended for her detailed Medicare plan, which comes closer to paying for itself than some Republican tax cuts. However, critics argue that her approach lacks a reassuring transition plan and fails to address public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system.\n\nLastly, the impeachment inquiry against President Trump has taken a new turn, with evidence of potential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress emerging. While the evidence is circumstantial, it has been noted that such evidence is not weak but rather based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed. The focus of the investigation will now be on the context and circumstances, with enough evidence present to support impeachment, although the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nThese stories highlight the intricate web of global politics, the importance of policy details, and the ongoing investigations that shape the course of nations. As the world watches, the outcomes of these stories will have far-reaching implications for the future of Kashmir, the United States, and the presidency.",
    " Title: Michelle Obama Breaks Hillary Clinton's 17-Year Streak as Most Admired Woman; Barack Obama Wins Most Admired Man for 11th Consecutive Year\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, former First Lady Michelle Obama has been named by Americans as the woman they admire most, marking the first time in 17 years that Hillary Clinton has not held the title. This year's Gallup poll, which has been conducted annually since 1946, also saw Barack Obama win the Most Admired Man category for the 11th consecutive year.\n\nMichelle Obama, who is currently touring to promote her recently released autobiography, beat out Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, and Melania Trump for the top spot. Queen Elizabeth, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, human rights activist Malala Yousafzai, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rounded out the top 10 most admired women this year.\n\nBarack Obama is now just one first-place finish short of tying Dwight Eisenhower for the most times being Most Admired Man. Eisenhower won the distinction 12 times, including eight years as president from 1953 through 1960, as well as in 1950, 1952, 1967, and 1968.\n\nThe incumbent president did not win the honor this year, marking only the 13th time in 72 measurements that this has occurred. Usually, the president does not win when he has subpar job approval ratings, as is the case with President Donald Trump. Trump and Gerald Ford are the two presidents to date who did not win the honor while in office.\n\nThe top 10 most admired men this year includes former President George W. Bush, Pope Francis, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former President Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe list this year is notable for the absence of two men who often ranked high but who passed away in 2018, Sen. John McCain and the Rev. Billy Graham. McCain finished in the top 10 six times, while Graham had more top 10 finishes than any man or woman, a record 61 times. Graham was in the top 10 every year from 1955 through 2017, with the exception of 1962.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans had dominant favorites for Most Admired Man, with 35% of Democrats naming Obama and 32% of Republicans naming Trump. Independents were slightly more likely to name Obama (13%) than Trump (10%), while Republicans more often mentioned Obama (7%) than Democrats did Trump (1%).\n\nMichelle Obama was the Democrats' favorite for Most Admired Woman, with 28% naming her, compared with 7% for Winfrey and 7% for Clinton. Obama also won by a significant margin among independents. Melania Trump was the top finisher among Republicans, at 9%, with Obama and Winfrey getting 5% each.\n\nThe year 2018 brought about a change at the top of Gallup's Most Admired Woman list for the first time in 17 years, with Hillary Clinton falling back now that she has more fully retreated to private life after a long career as first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state, and two-time presidential candidate. Michelle Obama stepped into that void as she has authored a best-selling autobiography and is promoting it with a major tour of large U.S. arenas.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama continues to win as Most Admired Man and is poised to tie Eisenhower for the most No. 1 finishes among men if he earns the title in 2019. Meanwhile, Trump likely has at least two more chances to finish first while president and avoid becoming just the second president never to have gotten the distinction. His doing so depends on having decent job approval ratings and the lack of a credible Democratic figure to vie with him for the honor, neither of which has been the case during Trump's first two years in office.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.",
    " Title: The Electoral College: A Historical Compromise and Its Controversial Modern Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Electoral College, a unique feature of the United States' political system, was established by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between direct popular vote and Congressional selection of the President. This system, which has been in place for over 200 years, has been a subject of debate and controversy, particularly in instances where the outcome of the popular vote does not align with the Electoral College results.\n\nIn essence, the President is not elected through a national popular vote but by Electoral votes. Each state has a designated number of Electors equal to the sum of its Senators and Representatives in Congress. This results in a total of 538 Electoral votes, with a 270 majority needed to elect the President. The Electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the popular vote in each state, with the exception of Nebraska and Maine, where votes are allocated proportionally.\n\nThe Electoral College was a compromise aimed at addressing concerns about a \"democratic mob\" influencing the election if a direct popular vote were implemented, or excessive concentration of power and potential corruption if Congress directly elected the President. The system also served as a compromise for the South, allowing for every three out of five slaves to be counted toward state population totals, a practice known as the \"three-fifths compromise.\"\n\nSince its inception, there have been over 700 proposals to eliminate or reform the Electoral College in Congress. The provisions for electing the President and Vice President have been among the most amended parts of the Constitution. The last serious attempt to change the Electoral College began in 1966, but the proposal was defeated due to a lack of the required two-thirds majority for constitutional amendments.\n\nIn response to ongoing debates, some states have signed a pact to bypass the Electoral College without amending the Constitution. This pact would award Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of the outcome in individual states. For example, if a democratic candidate won the state of California's popular vote but a Republican won the national popular vote, all of California's Electoral votes would be awarded to the Republican candidate.\n\nThe Electoral College's purpose is to ensure that elections are fair and reflect the will of the people. Supporters argue that the system encourages candidates to build coalitions and pay attention to the entire country, rather than focusing on a few populous mega-cities. Opponents, however, contend that the system discourages candidates from paying attention to the entire country and instead focuses on a few battleground states.\n\nAs the United States continues to evolve, the debate over the Electoral College's efficiency and fairness remains a contentious issue, with proponents and opponents presenting compelling arguments on both sides.",
    " Title: House Republicans Divided Over Immigration Reform, Border Security Remains Priority\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, Republican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives expressed division over the issue of granting legal status to the estimated 11 million undocumented individuals residing in the United States. The meeting, which focused on immigration reform, revealed a lack of consensus on the matter, with some lawmakers suggesting a 50/50 split.\n\nRepresentative Steve King, one of the meeting's attendees, stated that there is a disagreement within the group regarding the legal status of undocumented residents. The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a comprehensive immigration bill last month that includes a pathway to citizenship for these individuals.\n\nWhile there seems to be a consensus on the need to strengthen border security, Republican lawmakers suggested that House Speaker John Boehner could seek passage of a bill focusing on border security as a first step toward a larger agreement. The Republican leaders issued a statement reiterating their rejection of the Senate-passed bill, which puts the 11 million on a 13-year path to citizenship.\n\nSenator Jeff Flake, who helped write the Senate bill and served 12 years in the House, expressed his disappointment, stating, \"It's hard not to be discouraged right now.\" The Senate bill removes the threat of deportation for most illegal residents, but it includes several hurdles to citizenship, such as learning English, paying back taxes, and passing criminal background checks.\n\nThe meeting comes as President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats have been urging prompt action by the House. Earlier on Wednesday, the president told a group of Hispanic lawmakers that he was willing to do whatever it takes to help enact a bill. Even former President George W. Bush, who rarely wades into policy debates, gave a boost to efforts in Congress, stating that the current immigration system is broken and expressing hope for a \"positive resolution.\"\n\nHowever, House Republicans, who hold a majority over Democrats, gave no indication of fast action on a major bill. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma stated that it would take months, not weeks or days, for a major bill to be passed.\n\nMeanwhile, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is reportedly working on a plan to grant citizenship for children of illegal immigrants who are in the United States through no fault of their own. This is a shift from previous Republican positions, as they have blocked such legislation in the past.\n\nEven this relatively modest step is controversial among some of the most conservative House Republicans. Representative Mo Brooks argued against legislation that would help those in the United States illegally, stating, \"Anyone who has come to our country, their first step on American soil is to thumb their nose at American laws... we should not award them with our highest honor, which is citizenship.\"\n\nAs the November presidential election, in which Obama captured more than 70 percent of the growing Hispanic vote, was seen by many Republicans as a wake-up call that their party must do more to appeal to minorities, the call for comprehensive reform resonates with some Republican senators and with some prospective Republican presidential candidates. However, it holds less appeal to House Republicans who fear challenges from the conservative Tea Party movement if they back a pathway to citizenship, a core demand of Democrats.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which tracks congressional races, only 24 of the 234 House Republicans represent districts that are more than 25 percent Hispanic. David Wasserman, who conducted the Cook study, stated, \"They (House Republicans) don't know if they will face a Republican primary challenge if they vote for an immigration bill backed by the president.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary Amidst Partisan Divisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Chuck Hagel's nomination as Defense Secretary on Tuesday, concluding a contentious battle that revealed deep-seated partisan divisions over President Barack Obama's pick for the Pentagon post. The vote was historically close, with 58 senators in favor and 41 opposing.\n\nDespite Hagel's Republican background, his nomination faced significant resistance from many senators, a sign of the distrust towards the man chosen to lead the Defense Department at a time when the country is winding down the Afghanistan war and assessing emerging threats from Iran, Syria, and other regions in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nRepublicans had initially delayed the nomination due to demands for more information from the Obama administration regarding the September 11 Libya attacks. They also raised concerns about Hagel's past statements and votes on issues such as Israel, Iran, and nuclear weapons.\n\nSenator John McCain, a leading Republican, clashed with Hagel over his opposition to President George W. Bush's decision to send additional troops to Iraq in 2007, a time when the war seemed to be nearing a critical point. Hagel, who voted to authorize military force in Iraq, later opposed the conflict, comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it diverted attention from Afghanistan.\n\nSenator McCain labeled Hagel unqualified for the Pentagon job, despite previously describing him as fit for a Cabinet post. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid questioned the delaying tactics used by his Republican colleagues, stating, \"Twelve days later, nothing. Nothing has changed. Sen. Hagel's exemplary record of service to his country remains untarnished.\"\n\nReid attributed the delay to partisanship over Obama's second-term national security team. Both Reid and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat, emphasized the urgency to act, given the impending automatic, across-the-board budget cuts affecting the Pentagon.\n\nHagel will succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and join Obama's retooled national security team. The Senate's split decision, with Republicans turning on their former party colleague and Democrats standing by Obama's nominee, was evident throughout the process.\n\nHagel also faced criticism over a May 2012 study he co-authored for the advocacy group Global Zero, which called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and the eventual elimination of all the world's nuclear arms. The group argued that with the end of the Cold War, the United States can reduce its total nuclear arsenal to 900 without compromising security.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential campaign, Hagel faced intense criticism from well-funded, Republican-leaning outside groups that labeled him \"anti-Israel\" and pressured senators to oppose his nomination. The groups ran television and print ads criticizing Hagel.\n\nOpponents were particularly incensed by Hagel's use of the term \"Jewish lobby\" to refer to pro-Israel groups. He later apologized, stating that he should have used another term and should not have suggested that these groups had intimidated members of the Senate into favoring actions contrary to U.S. interests.\n\nThroughout the process, Hagel spent weeks reaching out to members of the Senate, meeting individually with lawmakers to address their concerns and seeking to reassure them about his policies. Despite his halting and inconsistent performance during his confirmation hearing, there was no erosion in Democratic support for the president's choice, and Hagel already had the backing of three Republicans\u2014Sens. Thad Cochran, Mike Johanns, and Richard Shelby. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also switched to support Hagel in the final vote.",
    " Title: President Trump's Job Approval Ratings Reach Highest Levels Since Presidency Amid Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's job approval ratings have surged to the highest levels since the beginning of his presidency, according to the latest polls. The RealClearPolitics poll of polls shows Trump's approval rating at 47 percent, a significant improvement from his previous record of 46 percent. Simultaneously, his disapproval rating has dipped to 49.5 percent, the lowest since February 2017, the month he assumed office.\n\nIn just ten days, Trump's approval rating has improved by a net 6.5 points, with his average approval rating three points lower at 44 percent and his disapproval rating 3.5 points higher at 53 percent just a week ago. This upward trend is largely attributed to the president's handling of the medical and financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA recent Gallup poll showed a 60 percent approval rating for Trump's management of the crisis, indicating either a plurality or an outright majority approve of his actions. The president's early travel ban, implemented on January 31, is being viewed more favorably as time passes, with the European Union only instituting travel bans about two weeks ago. This travel ban may have prevented hundreds of thousands of travelers from epidemic areas from entering the country.\n\nTrump's daily press briefings, which allow him to communicate directly with the American people, have been well-received, with millions tuning in. The briefings, now held during prime time, have become a focal point for updates on the pandemic and the administration's response. This has led some media outlets, such as CNN and NBC News, to begin blacklisting these briefings, citing a desire to focus on other topics.\n\nTrump's leadership during this dual crisis has been marked by dynamic, outside-the-box thinking, particularly in slashing red tape, cutting regulations, and involving the private sector. The president's briefings feature impressive experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, and while there may be occasional disagreements between these experts and the president, the public seems to appreciate this open dialogue.\n\nTrump has also demonstrated a willingness to work with Democrats, such as Governors Newsom of California and Cuomo of New York, as well as collaborating with Democrats in the U.S. Senate to pass the $2 trillion stimulus package. The public is seeking cooperation and unity during this time, and Trump's ability to work across party lines is being viewed positively.\n\nThe media's portrayal of Trump has been a significant factor in the president's improved approval ratings. The media's coverage of Trump has been described as \"awful\" by some, and Trump's ability to handle their criticism with skill has given the public confidence in his competence. This is not a president who can be caught off guard, who doesn't know his own mind, or who doesn't have the answers. That is exactly what the public wants to see in a leader during a crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the president's job approval ratings are at their highest levels since the beginning of his presidency, with the public approving of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. This improvement in approval ratings is a testament to Trump's leadership during this unprecedented time.\n\nADDED: Poll Shows Public Approves of Everyone's Handling of Coronavirus... Except the Media.",
    " Title: Trump's 2020 Budget Proposal Faces Criticism for Relying on \"Accounting Gimmicks\" and Overly Optimistic Economic Growth Projections\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed budget for 2020 aims to address America's escalating national debt, which surpassed $22 trillion and continues to grow. In a message to Congress, Trump asserts that the budget plan provides a clear roadmap for controlling federal spending and debt. However, the 150-page budget proposal, released on Monday, undermines this initial promise by relying on \"accounting gimmicks\" and overly optimistic economic growth projections.\n\nThe budget plan would run trillion-dollar deficits in each of the next four years and would take 15 years to balance, even with optimistic assumptions about future economic growth\u2014five years longer than the Trump administration's first budget promised. The budget proposal also fails to deliver on Trump's campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years.\n\nUnder the projections included in the budget plan, the country would run a deficit of $631 billion in 2025, hardly smaller than the $666 billion deficit in the final fiscal year of President Barack Obama's time in office. Over 10 years, Trump's budget would add more than $7.9 trillion to the national debt.\n\nThe real outcome is likely to be much worse than the estimates provided by the White House. The budget assumes 3 percent annual economic growth for the next decade, a figure that's well in excess of what most economists expect. The Federal Reserve, for example, projects 2.3 percent growth over the next year.\n\nWithout those overly rosy assumptions, the national debt would likely be $2 trillion higher by 2029, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonpartisan group that advocates for balanced budgets. The group says the budget is likely to add about $10 trillion to the national debt by 2029.\n\n\"President Trump's budget aims to reverse an unsustainable fiscal situation and put debt on a downward path relative to the economy,\" says Maya MacGuineas, president of the CRFB. \"Unfortunately, as in previous years, he relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions.\"\n\nThe latest projections from the Congressional Budget Office assume lower levels of future revenue than the Trump budget does. As a result, the CBO does not expect the deficit to decline during the next decade, and expects that it will reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2029.\n\nWhile the budget proposal includes $660 billion in savings from repealing and replacing Obamacare, this policy seems virtually impossible now that Democrats hold the House. Already, Democrats are slamming Trump's budget for the non-defense discretionary cuts the administration has proposed.\n\nWorse, Trump's budget attempts to hide spending increases for the Pentagon by moving those new funds into off-the-books accounts originally meant to pay for America's foreign wars. The administration says it wants to tackle wasteful spending in welfare and other domestic programs, but there's plenty of wasteful spending at the Pentagon, too. It's hard to take the president's calls for belt-tightening seriously when the cuts only apply to some parts of the federal budget.\n\nBalancing a budget that's $22 trillion in the red is not easy, of course, but the first requirement should be to stop making matters worse. \"The nation has never been in such a troubling fiscal situation,\" writes Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. \"Federal debt is soaring even after a decade of economic growth. Debt is imposing a rising cost that burdens all of us. Politicians have always had incentives to spend, but never before has Washington been so irresponsible.\"\n\nTrump's budget also calls for the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which are currently expected to expire in 2025. As Edwards points out, the budget could balance within 10 years\u2014even with lower expected revenues\u2014if annual spending growth was restrained to 1.8 percent. That's a reasonable figure. Too bad this budget ignores it.",
    " Title: State Legislatures Take Center Stage in Partisan Battles as Gridlock Persists in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a year marked by contentious debates on gun control, healthcare, education, and police procedures, state legislatures have emerged as key players in shaping policy, with analysts suggesting that the decisions made at the state level may have more immediate and lasting effects than those approved in Washington, D.C., where government is currently divided.\n\nThe roots of this polarization in state legislatures can be traced back to the elections in 2010, when Republicans made significant gains in statehouses and pushed for policies such as restricting labor unions and abortion access, while expanding gun rights, according to Sarah F. Anzia, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the same time, national organizations representing a wide range of interest groups, from teachers to gun owners, became more active in state capitals, finding it easier to make headway in places like Sacramento and Charleston, W.Va., due to the gridlock in Congress.\n\nThe number of states with either supermajorities of Democrats that also have Democratic governors (California, Nevada, Oregon, among others) or Republicans with Republican governors (Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, among others) has grown, leading to less need for compromise among lawmakers.\n\n\"If you are a Republican in one state, you are probably going to be pushing the same agenda as a Republican in another state, and the same is true for Democrats,\" said Dr. Anzia. \"That hasn't always been true, and the result is that now more than ever, state legislatures are key players in these partisan battles over politics.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, the only state left with a divided legislature, promises of bipartisanship sometimes devolved into stalemate. During a budget standoff last month, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who campaigned last year on a pledge to work across the aisle, angrily denounced Republicans for blocking gun control efforts and supporting deep tax cuts, stating that those policies \"fit better in Mississippi and Alabama than they do in Minnesota.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tweet Triggers Navy Secretary's Resignation: A Closer Look at the Gallagher Case and the USS Gerald Ford Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump announced the termination of Richard Spencer, the Secretary of the Navy, by Defense Secretary Mark Esper. The move came after Trump's criticism of Spencer's handling of the Gallagher case and other performance issues.\n\nTrump expressed his displeasure with the trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was acquitted of murdering a wounded prisoner in Iraq but convicted of posing for a photo with the militant's body. Gallagher was demoted, but Trump restored his rank earlier this month. However, days later, Navy officials announced that boards were being convened to consider expelling Gallagher and three of his superior officers from the commando unit.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and his Pentagon leaders has been marked by increasing turmoil over the past year, starting with retired Gen. Jim Mattis' resignation as Defense secretary in December. Trump has since gone through three acting Defense secretaries, including Spencer, before Esper was confirmed in July. On Esper's watch, Trump has ordered a pullout from Syria, only to again partially reverse it under pressure from the Pentagon and Congress.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he looked forward to receiving and considering a nomination for the next Secretary of the Navy as soon as possible.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Spencer wrote that he could not in good conscience obey an order he believed violated the sacred oath he took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. This apparent reference to Trump's direction that the Navy not eject Gallagher from the SEALs was the root of the clash that led to Spencer's departure.\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding the USS Gerald Ford, the Navy's next aircraft carrier, may have also played a role in the clash. Delays have plagued the carrier's weapons elevators, and Spencer publicly disagreed with Trump last January over the delivery schedule of the USS Gerald Ford.\n\nTrump has announced his intention to nominate Rear Adm. Kenneth Braithwaite, the ambassador to Norway, to replace Spencer as Navy secretary. The details of the way ahead will be discussed on Monday by Esper, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, and the service's new acting secretary, Thomas Modly.\n\nThe unusual intervention by Trump in the Gallagher case and the subsequent clash that led to Spencer's departure has been criticized by former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who served in the Obama administration. Mabus stated that Trump's actions undermined good order and discipline and dishonored the SEALs. The former senior Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity described the situation as the \"Trump circus.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Questions Michael Cohen Over Secretly Recorded Conversation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump questioned his former attorney, Michael Cohen, over a conversation they had that was secretly recorded by Cohen. This is the first comment Trump has made since CNN aired the audio of the conversation Tuesday night.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"What kind of a lawyer would tape a client?\" He also asked, \"So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things?\"\n\nIn the recording, Cohen can be heard discussing the creation of a company for the transfer of information regarding American Media Inc. head David Pecker. The conversation seems to refer to a payment for the story of a former Playboy model who alleged an affair with Trump. However, the sound is muddled, and it's not clear whether Trump is suggesting paying or not paying.\n\nThe recording is legal, as New York only requires one party to consent to allow a conversation to be recorded. However, experts have largely said the tape does not prove any criminal wrongdoing. The tape is one of 12 that the government seized during a raid of Cohen's apartment, office, and hotel room earlier this year. The contents of the other tapes are not publicly known at this time.\n\nTrump has been relatively quiet about Cohen since the FBI raided Cohen's office in April, calling it an \"attack on our country.\" However, he has not explicitly tweeted about or commented on Cohen as the case progresses in the Southern District of New York.\n\nCohen, who worked for years as the president's fixer at the Trump Organization, is reportedly under investigation for bank fraud and campaign finance law violations. He has recently raised speculation that he might cooperate with investigators after saying his \"first loyalty\" is to the country, not Trump.",
    " Title: Governor Chris Christie Sparks Controversy as He Visits Closed State Beach During Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a government shutdown that left New Jersey's state-operated beaches closed to the public, Governor Chris Christie found himself at the center of a controversy this weekend. Photos emerged showing the governor lounging on the pristine Island Beach State Park, a state park that is currently closed due to the budget impasse.\n\nThe New Jersey Star-Ledger published aerial photos of Christie and his family enjoying the beach, with the governor seen lounging in a beach chair and his family playing paddleboard and enjoying beverages. When asked during a press conference in Trenton about the shutdown if he had gotten any sun that day, Christie reportedly said, \"I did not, I did not get any sun today.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, Christie's spokesman stated that the governor was only briefly on the beach, talking to his family. The spokesman added that Christie had a baseball hat on and did not get any sun.\n\nOn Saturday, Christie had defended using the state park that is closed to the rest of the state's residents. He told the newspaper that his family does not use any state services while there, and emphasized that his residence is separate from the park.\n\nTwitter users were quick to react, with many sharing memes and expressing their disapproval of the governor's actions. One of the most pointed headlines came from the Asbury Park Press, which wrote, \"Gov. Christie, get the hell off the beach!\"\n\nThis incident brings back memories of a similar controversy in 2011, when Christie issued a directive for people to \"get the hell off the beach\" in Asbury Park during Hurricane Irene.\n\nChristie's second term as governor ends in January 2018, and it remains to be seen if he will have time to \"maximize his tan\" as he put it. On Monday morning, Christie tweeted a photo of a beach, touting many open beaches in New Jersey. However, state beaches remain closed due to the shutdown.\n\nChristie called in to a local Fox News affiliate on Monday to say that if the Legislature passes a budget, he will sign it. Fox anchor Teresa Priolo asked Christie if his visit to the beach signaled that he was out of touch with the people of his state.\n\n\"Most of the time when they catch politicians with hidden cameras and planes flying over you, they catch you with someone you're not supposed to be with,\" Christie said. \"I was actually with who I was supposed to be with and where I was supposed to be. And I really wonder about journalists who spend money flying planes to look whether people are actually where they said they would be. I'm sure there are Pulitzers coming, it will be great.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's own Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno posted her disapproval of Christie's beach visit on Facebook. Guadagno, a Republican, has been Christie's second-in-command since 2010 and is now running for governor herself. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, the Democratic candidate, Phil Murphy, leads Guadagno 55-26 percent.",
    " Title: House Republican Leaders Call for Investigation into State Department's Handling of Benghazi Consulate Security\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo House Republican leaders have called for a hearing to investigate the State Department's handling of security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, following the September 11 terrorist attack that resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nReps. Darrell E. Issa and Jason Chaffetz, in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday, cited 13 security-related incidents in Benghazi in the six months prior to the attack. These incidents included a pro-Gadhafi Facebook page that threatened Ambassador Stevens, among other unreported incidents.\n\nThe lawmakers allege that the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi, but were denied resources by officials in Washington. In their letter, they stated that \"multiple U.S. federal government officials have confirmed... that, prior to the Sept. 11 attack, the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi. The mission in Libya, however, was denied these resources by officials in Washington.\"\n\nIssa, California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Chaffetz, Utah Republican and chairman of the national security subcommittee, have scheduled a hearing for October 10. The State Department, which closed the consulate building in Benghazi and removed its staff from the city on Monday, has pledged its cooperation with the congressional investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command was preparing data to help identify and potentially capture or kill militants suspected of conducting the Benghazi attack.\n\nState Department officials have stated that Clinton will respond immediately to Issa and Chaffetz's letter and will cooperate fully with the congressional investigation. However, they have not yet addressed the specific requests and assertions made in the letter.\n\nSeveral former government officials have suggested that no reasonable security presence could have successfully defended the consulate against the sophisticated, multi-stage assault by extremists armed with automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenade-launchers, and mortars.\n\nThe attack occurred amid widespread protests directed against U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world, sparked by an Internet video denigrating Islam's Prophet Muhammad. For more than a week, administration officials maintained that the attack was \"spontaneous,\" stating that it had developed out of an angry demonstration outside the consulate. However, the U.S. director of national intelligence now says that this information was the result of erroneous early analyses of the events and officials have linked it to terrorist groups.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the administration for taking eight days to use the term \"terrorist attack\" to describe the assault and have accused the administration of downplaying the seriousness of the attack due to its contradiction of President Obama's election-campaign narrative about the success of his campaign against al Qaeda. More hawkish conservatives have suggested that the attack was provoked by \"weakness\" on the part of the administration in the Middle East.\n\nIssa's inquiry will join at least four other investigations into the attack, including a special panel convened by Clinton to review security prior to the attack, an inquiry by the State Department's acting Inspector General, a criminal investigation by the FBI, and a Libyan criminal investigation.",
    " Title: B&G Foods Initiates Review of Cream of Wheat Packaging Following Racial Stereotype Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that mirrors recent decisions by the parent companies of Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben's, and Mrs. Butterworth's, B&G Foods, the parent company of Cream of Wheat, has announced an immediate review of the brand's packaging. The review comes in response to growing concerns regarding the depiction of a smiling Black chef on the packaging, a stereotype that has been in use since the 1890s.\n\nThe announcement was made in a news release, where B&G Foods expressed their commitment to evaluating their packaging and taking proactive steps to ensure their brands do not inadvertently contribute to systemic racism. The company unequivocally stands against prejudice and injustice of any kind.\n\nThe breakfast cereal, known for its enriched farina, has long been criticized for the use of the Black chef image. The mascot on early boxes was known as Rastus, a racial caricature of a Black man, which is considered derogatory. The image was replaced in the 1920s and is believed to be a depiction of a Chicago chef named Frank L. White, who died in 1938.\n\nQuaker Oats was the first to announce on Wednesday that it would retire Aunt Jemima from packaging on its brand of syrup and pancake mixes, stating that the character is based on a racial stereotype. Hours later, Mars, the owner of Uncle Ben's brand, announced it \"is the right time to evolve the Uncle Ben\u2019s brand, including its visual brand identity.\"\n\nConagra Brands also announced on Wednesday that it has \"begun a complete brand and packaging review on Mrs. Butterworth's.\" The shape of the brand\u2019s syrup bottles, with the offensive \"Mammy\" racial caricature of stereotypes for Black women, is under review.\n\nThis review of Cream of Wheat's packaging follows a series of announcements by major food companies to reevaluate and potentially change their racially charged imagery. The future of the Cream of Wheat packaging remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Anne Holton Steps Up as Surrogate for Hillary Clinton Campaign Amidst Polling Slump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a polling slump, the Democratic ticket is enlisting a potent surrogate to the campaign trail: Anne Holton, the wife of Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine and daughter of a former Republican governor in the swing state of Virginia. Holton, who has an accomplished legal and political resume, is increasingly stepping out on her own to stump for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nHolton, a former lawyer and judge, and ex-Virginia education secretary, is in a unique position to push Clinton's education platform. She could also be used to help shore up support among women voters who may be having second thoughts about Clinton.\n\n\"Because Hillary Clinton's favorability and trust numbers are so low - she needs help, and it's the kind of help Bill Clinton is unable to provide,\" said Matthew Dallek, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, Clinton's popularity among registered voters hit a new low, with 41 percent of Americans having a positive view of Clinton, while 56 percent have a negative view. Her popularity among women sank to 45-52 percent, practically a reversal from a month prior.\n\nThough former President Clinton can speak to his wife's accomplishments, it's arguably tougher for him to present her as a relatable figure to women voters who may be on the fence. On the stump, Holton is just as comfortable highlighting Clinton's role as a new grandmother, sometimes receiving \"awws\" from audience members, as she is focusing on the particulars of the candidate's education platform.\n\nHolton recently made stops in New Hampshire, Roanoke, Va., her hometown, Virginia Western Community College, and a local campaign office for a volunteer appreciation event. She also made additional stops in the state on Monday, before hitting up a fundraiser with her husband in Norfolk on Friday.\n\nOn a recent stop at a Richmond campaign office, Holton gave volunteers a pep talk, The Associated Press reported. \"This has been a whirlwind,\" Holton said. \"Tim told me on the phone this morning that... he has been in 24 states in 30 days,\" she said. \"I have not. But I've had some fun on the trail, too.... It is crazy and wild. Our lives have been turned topsy-turvy. But for such a great cause. And we're thrilled to be part of it.\"\n\nDallek said it is \"a bit unusual\" for the spouse of a vice presidential nominee to play such a prominent role, but said Holton \"is a political factor and public expert in her own right.\"\n\nHolton, a popular former first lady of Virginia when Kaine was governor, also is the daughter of A. Linwood Holton, Jr., a moderate Republican who in 1970 became the first GOP governor to be elected in the state in nearly a century. Holton's father worked to integrate the schools in response to court-ordered desegregation, even sending a young Anne Holton to attend a public school in Richmond with a black student majority.\n\nThough it doesn't seem too radical today, at the time, it was groundbreaking. \"It was my first real experience of being with people who came from a much different background than mine,\" she recently said during a visit to Pittsburgh. \"I did learn some things about differences, but I learned a lot more about similarities.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign, which signs off on Holton's public appearances, declined an interview request from FoxNews.com. On the Republican side, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, hasn't been as visible as Holton but is starting to show up more on the trail. Two weeks ago, Karen Pence, who also has an accomplished background in education, accompanied her husband on a swing through Georgia.",

The President has been advocating for immigration reform all year, but in his holiday message, he refrained from making any political references.\n\nThe President and his family will spend the holiday at the White House, much like many Americans, sharing meals, stories, and expressing gratitude. Among the blessings he mentioned were the freedoms defended by the nation's men and women in uniform.\n\n\"We give thanks for the freedoms they defend\u2014the freedom to think what we want and say what we think, to worship according to our own beliefs, to choose our leaders and, yes, criticize them without punishment,\" the President said.\n\nHe also called on Americans to remember those in need and to show compassion, citing acts of kindness such as volunteering at soup kitchens, joining service projects, or helping neighbors.\n\n\"We give thanks to everyone who\u2019s doing their part to make the United States a better, more compassionate nation\u2014who spend their Thanksgiving volunteering at a soup kitchen, or joining a service project, or bringing food and cheer to a lonely neighbor,\" he said.\n\nPresident Obama concluded his address by emphasizing unity, stating, \"No matter our differences, we\u2019re all part of one American family.

The march is scheduled for Saturday, coordinated by the group to emphasize their interpretation of the law, Act 746, which they believe authorizes open carry.\n\nArkansas Carry, with approximately 200 members in the state, is organizing the event in Fort Smith, with the new law, which took effect on August 16, defining a journey as traveling \"beyond the county in which the person lives.\" The group's chairman, Steve Jones, contends that the attorney general's opinion is incorrect, stating, \"We're going to do the walk because it's legal, and we're trying to show that Act 746 does authorize open carry, contrary to what the attorney general said.\"\n\nJones has coordinated the event with local police and prosecutors, though city officials have stated they are staying neutral in the debate over the attorney general's opinion. In an email to officers, Fort Smith Police Chief Kevin Lindsey wrote that the city prosecutor advised there would be no violation of the law unless \"an officer could prove that there was an unlawful attempt to employ a handgun, knife, or club as a weapon against a person.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Fort Smith Police Department confirmed that a patrol car will be present at Saturday's march. Sgt. Daniel Grubbs, a spokesperson for the department, stated, \"The chief is not really getting into the debate of agreeing or disagreeing with the AG's opinion. It's 'you've given us a scenario, here's what you'd like to do, as long as everyone is lawfully in possession, they're legally able to possess one and they do not commit any type of crime, no one is going to be arrested.'\"\n\nAttorney General Dustin McDaniel, in a previous advisory opinion, stated that the \"journey\" exception was meant to allow Arkansans to \"protect themselves from the dangers of the open road.\" However, McDaniel's opinion also stated that the new law does not authorize open carry.\n\nSteve Jones and Arkansas Carry are considering holding similar marches in other cities to further highlight the law and their interpretation of it. As of now, the attorney general has declined to comment on Saturday's event.",
    " Title: House Leadership Faces Internal Struggles as Pelosi Faces Pressure from Within\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that have shaken the Democratic Party, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing increasing pressure from within her own party as she struggles to maintain control and unity among Democrats. This was evident on Wednesday, as 58 Democrats voted in favor of a motion to impeach President Trump, despite Pelosi's long-standing insistence that Democrats hold off on pushing for impeachment.\n\nPelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer issued a joint statement on Wednesday, stating, \"Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\" However, their call for restraint was largely ignored, as the impeachment motion moved forward.\n\nPelosi's reluctance to push for impeachment has put her at odds with left-wing activist groups who have been demanding Trump's impeachment since before he was sworn into office. This is not the first time Pelosi has faced criticism for her approach to impeachment. In 1998, during the impeachment of President Clinton, Pelosi was one of a handful of Democrats who voted against the impeachment articles.\n\nAnother significant challenge for Pelosi came last Friday with the resignation of Democratic Michigan Rep. John Conyers. Sworn affidavits signed by four of his former staffers described Conyers, who resigned on Friday, as a serial sexual harasser who preyed on his female staffers and demanded sexual favors from them. Conyers also allegedly abused taxpayer resources to pursue sexual relationships with women.\n\nPelosi initially defended Conyers, an 88-year-old Democrat who is considered an \"icon\" in the party, and deferred to a House Ethics Committee investigation, a process that can stretch out for years. It took Pelosi 10 days to call for Conyers' resignation, which she did only after facing the prospect of a revolt from members furious over Conyers remaining in office.\n\nThe first two Democrats to demand Conyers' resignation were New York Rep. Kathleen Rice, who has said for months that she thinks Pelosi should step down from her leadership position, and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a first-term congresswoman. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for House Minority Leader last year, also pressured Democratic leadership, demanding last Wednesday that the investigation into Conyers finish up by the end of the week.\n\nOn the same day, Rice and other Democrats stormed out of a meeting with House Democrats about Conyers because they didn't believe they were taking the matter seriously enough. New York Rep. Joseph Crowley and California Rep. Linda Sanchez, chair and vice-chair of the House Democratic Caucus, took the opposite position, urging restraint and trying to draw the process out.\n\n\"I don't know all the facts, I don't know the specific allegations,\" Sanchez said, adding that she \"can't sit and judge a member and call for their resignation unless I've been party to hearing all of the evidence and hearing the defense of the evidence.\"\n\n\"Calling for the resignation of someone doesn't actually create the resignation,\" said Crowley, adding that he would wait for the ethics committee's investigation.\n\nThe very next day, Pelosi, Crowley, and Sanchez caved to their more junior colleagues and demanded Conyers' resignation. This incident, along with the impeachment vote, highlights the growing tension within the Democratic Party and Pelosi's struggle to maintain control and lead her members effectively.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Increased Spending in FY 2016 Budget, Setting Up Fiscal Showdown with Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that sets up a potential fiscal showdown with the Republican-controlled Congress, President Obama announced on Saturday that his fiscal year 2016 budget, to be unveiled on Monday, will include significant spending increases in areas such as infrastructure and education. The President argued that the federal government can afford these investments due to shrinking deficits, although he also proposed tax hikes on the wealthy to fund the proposed $74 billion increase in spending.\n\nThe President's budget also aims to undo the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, paving the way for even higher spending in the future. In his weekly address, Mr. Obama outlined his budget's key priorities, which include investing in research, infrastructure, manufacturing, and expanding access to faster internet and new markets.\n\nThe President emphasized that the U.S. can afford these investments, citing a two-thirds reduction in deficits since he took office. However, it is widely expected that the President's budget will face resistance in its current form from the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nWhile the national debt has decreased significantly over the past several years, it continues to rise, standing at $10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office.\n\nIn response, Republicans are countering Mr. Obama's message of \"middle-class economics\" by pushing their own measures aimed at helping working families. House GOP leaders have proposed a plan to expand the 529 college savings accounts, which allow families to save for college and withdraw the money tax-free.\n\nThe White House had initially sought to tax 529s, a proposal that was met with heavy public criticism and private pressure from prominent Democrats. However, the President withdrew the plan.\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) criticized the President's decision, stating, \"It was a terribly misguided idea, but it took a public outcry for the President to realize it... First, the President should put his full weight behind our plan to expand and strengthen 529 accounts... Because we should be rewarding people who work hard and play by the rules \u2014 not punishing them.\"\n\nRep. Jenkins also urged the President to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a measure that cleared the Senate this week but faces a potential veto from Mr. Obama.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee to Review Classified Document on Drone Policy Amidst Ongoing Debate\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is set to review a classified document on Thursday, which seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks. The move comes as part of the ongoing commitment by the Obama administration to consult with Congress on national security matters, and follows complaints from senators, including several Democrats, about the secrecy surrounding the drone policy.\n\nThe announcement was made by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who stated, \"I am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the Intelligence Committee with access to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations.\" She emphasized the importance of the committee's oversight function in fully understanding the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe development comes just before the confirmation hearings for Obama's CIA director nominee, John Brennan, who has been a key figure in the drone policy during his four-year tenure as the president's principal adviser on terrorism. The 16-page white paper, titled \"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force,\" is a policy paper rather than an official legal document.\n\nThe president is turning over the information because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy, an administration official said. In a 2012 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because there is no international law that bans the use of drones for this purpose.\n\nHowever, the drone campaign has been a subject of controversy, with United Nations special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, planning to investigate U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. The drone campaign has resulted in the deaths of at least 28 of al Qaeda's leading members, including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe targeted killing of al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone, and his teenage son in a separate strike, has been a point of contention for human rights groups in the United States. On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers, defended the attack that killed al-Awlaki, stating that he had officially joined al Qaeda and had declared war on the United States.\n\nIn his speech at the Wilson Center, Brennan defended drone strikes as \"ethical\" due to their ability to precisely target military objectives while minimizing collateral damage. Obama himself defended the policy in an appearance on \"The Daily Show\" last October. The debate over the legality and ethics of drone strikes is expected to continue as the Senate Intelligence Committee reviews the classified document.",
    " Title: ACLU Seeks Mental Health Counseling for Separated Immigrant Children, Cites Ongoing Challenges in Family Reunification\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has requested a federal judge to order the U.S. government to establish a fund for providing mental health counseling to approximately 2,000 immigrant children who were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. The request was made in response to the government's failure to meet a court-ordered deadline for reuniting children under the age of five.\n\nThe ACLU's court filing on Thursday follows a turbulent week for U.S. immigration officials, who have faced criticism for their handling of family separations. The government, in the same court filing, acknowledged that it had missed the Tuesday deadline for reuniting the youngest children with their parents but claimed compliance with the judge's order.\n\nHowever, nearly half of the 103 children under five remain separated due to safety concerns, parental deportation, and other issues. The ACLU also accused the government of failing to communicate with the plaintiffs about the release of immigrants, a promise made to the judge.\n\nIn one case, the ACLU reported that immigration officials reunited a mother with her six-month-old daughter and left them alone at a bus stop late at night. The woman was able to secure a bus ticket around midnight on Tuesday after her attorney and an advocate intervened.\n\nIn addition to mental health counseling, the ACLU has also asked the judge to order the government to provide detailed information about all children not yet reunited and to expedite background checks and family relationship verifications. The government is now required to reunite all parents and the remaining children by July 26.\n\nThe government's struggles to reunite around 100 children under five have raised concerns among immigration advocates about the coherence of their plan for reuniting the remaining families. Immigration officials have attributed the delays to background checks, and in Thursday's court papers, they identified cases involving a parent with a murder warrant in Guatemala and others with suspected human trafficking violations. Other parents were barred from being reunited for less serious violations, such as drunk driving convictions.\n\nIn a joint statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stated, \"The reunification process has been chaotic and has undoubtedly come at a cost.\" Beth Krause, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society's Immigrant Youth Project, commented, \"The reunification process has been chaotic and has unequivocally come at a cost.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Duncan Hunter Resigns Amidst Campaign Funds Misuse Case, Highlights Congressional Accomplishments in Farewell Letter\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) has announced his resignation from the House of Representatives, effective January 13. The California Republican, who pleaded guilty last month to a single count of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds, chose to focus on his congressional accomplishments and military service in his resignation letter rather than addressing his legal troubles.\n\nHunter, 42, initially maintained his innocence for months but ultimately reached a plea bargain with prosecutors, admitting to misusing at least $150,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses. He is facing up to five years in prison and will be sentenced on March 17.\n\nIn his letter, Hunter did not mention his guilt or the details of his plea bargain. Instead, he highlighted his service in the Marines following the 9/11 terror attacks and his efforts to help his constituents.\n\n\"I learned from an early age the importance of liberty, the value of patriotism, and what a strong and secure border can bring to a community,\" he said. \"During my time in Congress, I had the privilege of helping thousands of individuals in my district.\"\n\nHunter also expressed pride in his efforts to give a voice to military personnel and his unwavering support for those who protect the nation's freedoms.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hunter and his wife spent part of the campaign funds on a birthday party for their daughter at an expensive hotel, as well as funding social outings with friends at a French bistro in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors also accused Hunter of spending part of the money on extramarital affairs with lobbyists and congressional aides.\n\nHunter's wife, Margaret, was also charged in the case but accepted a plea deal in June, which required her to testify against her husband. The couple could have faced up to decades in prison prior to their plea agreements.\n\nRepublicans enjoy an 11-point registration advantage over Democrats in California's 50th District. Former congressman for California\u2019s 49th District, Rep. Darrell Issa, is considered one of the front-runners to fill the vacant seat.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has yet to announce if he will call for a special election; he has the option under state law to leave the seat vacant until November, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune.",
    " Title: Georgia State Representative Erica Thomas and Eric Sparkes: Contrasting Accounts of Grocery Store Incident\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Georgia State Representative Erica Thomas (D) and Eric Sparkes, a local resident, have provided contrasting accounts of an incident that occurred at a local Publix supermarket.\n\nOn Saturday, Representative Thomas took to Twitter, stating that a white man had verbally assaulted her, calling her a \"lazy SOB\" and telling her to \"go back to where she came from\" because she had too many items in the express lane. Thomas, who is nine months pregnant, shared her experiences further in a Facebook live video.\n\n\"People are getting really out of control with this white privilege stuff,\" a visibly emotional Thomas said in the video. \"I'm at the grocery store and I'm in the 10 aisle, the aisle that says '10 items or less.' Yes, I have 15 items, but I can't stand up for long because I'm nine months pregnant.\"\n\nThomas continued, recounting the incident, \"This white man comes up to me and says, 'You lazy son of a b*tch. You need to go back where you came from.' And I said, 'Sir, you don't even know me. I'm not lazy. I'm nine months pregnant.'\"\n\nHowever, the man Thomas accused of making the comments, Eric Sparkes, appeared at her press conference to challenge her story. Sparkes, who identifies as Cuban, stated that the argument started over Thomas using the express lane while having too many items.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Sparkes explained, \"I walked into Publix, I bought my three items. There were three checkout lanes. One was express, the other two were empty. I kept my tongue shut. I went to pay for my items in one of the empty lanes. This lady, I noticed, had about 20 items on the conveyer.\"\n\nSparkes further stated, \"I walked up to the two customer service associates from Publix, asked them what can be done in a nice manner, and they said corporate policy [says] we can't do anything, but you as a customer can say something.\"\n\nAccording to Sparkes, the two exchanged words, at which point he said, \"You're selfish.\" He said after he made the comment, he walked out of the grocery store.\n\nSparkes has since denied Thomas's claims that he told her to \"go back where you came from.\" He stated, \"Her words stating on Twitter and her Facebook video saying I told she needs to go back to where she came from are untrue.\"\n\nIn a twist, Sparkes also claimed that Thomas is politicizing the incident for her benefit, stating, \"This woman is playing the victim for political purposes because she is a state legislator.\" He further added, \"I'm a Democrat and will vote Democrat for the rest of my life, so call me whatever you want to believe. For her political purposes, make it black, white, brown, or whatever. It is so untrue.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked a heated debate, with some supporting Thomas's account and others backing Sparkes's version of events. The Publix supermarket has not yet released a statement regarding the incident.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Tax Return Issue: A Look Back at His 2002 Campaign for Massachusetts Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political landscape, Mitt Romney's refusal to release more than two years of tax returns has become a contentious issue, with both the Obama campaign and some fellow Republicans pressing for more financial transparency. Romney, however, maintains that two years of tax returns, including his 2010 return and an estimate of 2011 tax information, are sufficient and that he has complied with the law.\n\nThis stance is reminiscent of Romney's position during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor, where he faced similar calls for tax transparency from his Democratic rival, Shannon O'Brien. In May 2002, Romney stated, \"People who run for public office are exposed to extraordinary scrutiny and that's as it should be, but there are some things that are not required for release, that are private, and I think my own income taxes, and my net worth and so forth are things I'd like to keep between myself and my family,\" according to the Boston Herald.\n\nDuring the 2002 race, Romney sought to make Enron a campaign issue when it was revealed that O'Brien's husband, Emmett Hayes, had lobbying ties to the scandalized energy and commodities firm. Hayes filed his taxes separately from O'Brien, and Romney's longtime strategist, Eric Fehrnstrom, demanded that O'Brien reveal her husband's financial ties to Enron. \"Her hands are not clean,\" Fehrnstrom said, according to the Herald. \"She can't claim to be disclosing anything until she discloses the returns of her husband, the Enron lobbyist. Under Shannon O'Brien, the state Pension Board lost millions by buying Enron stock when it was collapsing - what is she hiding?\"\n\nFehrnstrom made the demand even as Romney was refusing to release his own returns, drawing accusations of hypocrisy from editorial boards. However, Fehrnstrom defended the campaign's posture, saying that O'Brien was trying to hide important information from voters by declining to reveal her husband's returns, while Romney was simply acting on principle.\n\nThe tax return issue also made an appearance in Romney's first political campaign, his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy. In that race, Romney assumed the role of transparency advocate. \"It's time the biggest-taxing senator in Washington shows the people of Massachusetts how much he pays in taxes,\" Romney said in April of 1994, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Romney said he would release his own tax returns if Kennedy did, but the Senator refused, and so Romney did as well.\n\nAs the 2012 presidential race heats up, the tax return issue continues to be a point of contention for both Romney and his opponents. It remains to be seen whether Romney will choose to release more tax returns or if he will continue to stand by his current stance.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidate Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Mike Pence Engage in Religious Beliefs Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Democratic Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has taken a jab at Vice President Mike Pence's religious beliefs regarding marriage, sparking a debate between the two political figures.\n\nDuring an address to an LGBT campaign group, Buttigieg, who is openly gay and married, criticized Pence's stance on same-sex marriage. \"I wish the Mike Pence's of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,\" Buttigieg declared on Sunday. \"Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\"\n\nButtigieg further stated that his gay marriage brought him \"closer to God.\"\n\nIn response, Pence, who has been a staunch advocate for traditional marriage throughout his political career, has not issued any direct comments regarding Buttigieg's remarks. However, in an interview with CNBC, Pence stated, \"He knows me. But I get it. You know, it's like, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that's sliding off to the left. And they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are.\"\n\nPence emphasized that his stance on traditional marriage does not equate to criticism of those with different viewpoints. \"This doesn't mean that we're we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,\" Pence said.\n\nNotably, Pence and Buttigieg share a history, having worked closely together when Pence was governor of Indiana. Pence noted that they had a \"great working relationship.\"\n\nIn a separate response, Karen Pence, the Vice President's wife, addressed Buttigieg's comments, stating, \"In our country, we need to understand you shouldn't be attacked for what your religious beliefs are.\" She further added, \"I think kids need to learn that, at a young age, that this is OK, what faith people have. We don't attack them for their faith.\"\n\nThis exchange between the two political figures highlights the ongoing debate surrounding religious beliefs and their impact on political decisions, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage. Both candidates have maintained their respective stances, with Buttigieg emphasizing his personal faith and marriage, and Pence advocating for traditional marriage while affirming respect for those with differing viewpoints.",
    " Title: Ben Carson's Transition from Presidential Candidate to Vice Presidential Prospect\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Ben Carson's presidential campaign comes to a close, his pursuit of a vice presidential position is gaining momentum. Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that a meeting is scheduled for March 29 in Palm Beach, where Carson owns a mansion, to discuss future plans.\n\nThe gathering, reminiscent of an Avengers-like team, includes Ben Carson Jr., Robert Dees, who joined the campaign as chairman before Carson's withdrawal, Ed Brookover, the most recent campaign manager, treasurer Logan Delaney, and former senior adviser Mike Murray.\n\nThe agenda, according to multiple sources, will encompass discussions on managing the 700,000-person mailing list they've accumulated, the PAC connected with the campaign, and potentially establishing a speaking program for the doctor. The primary focus, however, will be positioning Carson favorably for a potential vice presidential offer from Donald Trump should he become the nominee.\n\nDelaney and Dees did not respond to requests for comment, while Shermichael Singleton, handling media requests, declined to answer questions. Brookover, who joined the Trump campaign as a part of a Delegate Selection Team, declined to comment on the meeting as well.\n\nThis latest development follows former Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett's transition to an adviser role in Trump's campaign earlier this year. The meeting's participants may not include any current members of the Trump campaign, but Carson has been open about his willingness to support Trump should he become the nominee.\n\nAfter ending his presidential campaign at the Conservative Political Action Conference two weeks ago, Carson announced he would be heading up the group My Faith Votes, aiming to mobilize Christian voters in the general election. Carson is the group's \"National Honorary Chairman.\"\n\nIn recent interviews, Carson has shown a more forgiving stance towards Trump's past criticisms, even dismissing Trump's comparison of his temperament to that of a child molester during the campaign. \"You have to admit, to some degree, it did work,\" Carson said in a Yahoo interview. \"A lot of people believed him.\"",
    " Title: White House and Congressional Leaders Grapple with Uncertainty as Shutdown and Debt Ceiling Crisis Nears Resolution\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the government shutdown and the looming debt ceiling crisis appear to be nearing a resolution, there is a growing sense of uncertainty about the long-term implications of the recent standoff. President Barack Obama's stated goal of ending the cycle of negotiating under threat and crisis-to-crisis seems to be proving elusive.\n\nDespite the White House's semantic efforts to distinguish between discussions on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling and actual negotiations, both parties have been engaged in temporary fixes that could potentially lead to another impasse in the near future. The next few days will be crucial in determining the government's funding level, the nation's debt status, and the timing of the next deadlines.\n\nHowever, few have faith that the agreement reached will fundamentally change the system's current working dynamics. With Obama having more than three years left in his presidency, he has managed to surprise many Republicans, Democrats, and reporters with his commitment to preserving Obamacare and maintaining budgetary principles.\n\nWhile the House GOP has been sidelined from the final stage negotiations for now, there remains a significant number of tea party Republicans who are facing criticism from moderates following Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) divisive tactics during the shutdown. Cruz, speaking at the Values Voters summit on Friday, maintained that the debate is far from over.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, expressed his belief that the issue will persist and could resurface during future continuing resolutions or debt ceiling votes. This sentiment is shared by reinvigorated Democrats, who view their opponents' continued insistence on the issue as a worn-out tactic that has lost its potency after the past two weeks.\n\nThe White House maintains that it is not negotiating with those who demanded a \"ransom\" and argues that the Republicans' continued use of the threat of default as a bargaining chip puts the American economy at risk. Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated that the White House is \"listening and talking,\" but not negotiating, and expressed concern over the potential global economic consequences of the Republicans' actions.\n\nIn the end, the resolution of the current crisis may provide only a temporary reprieve, with both parties bracing for the possibility of another showdown in the future. The White House argues that the Republicans have been forced to choose between risking a global meltdown and conceding to their demands, a choice that has not materialized in a market revolt as predicted. The long-term implications of this standoff remain to be seen, as both parties grapple with the aftermath of a contentious and uncertain few weeks.",
    " Title: President Trump and Former President Obama's Divergent Stances on Syria: A Retrospective Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, President Donald Trump condemned the chemical attack in Syria as \"reprehensible,\" placing blame on the Bashar al-Assad regime for the \"heinous actions\" that he argued were a result of the past administration's perceived weakness and irresolution. This marked a stark contrast to Trump's stance as a private citizen in 2013, when he advocated for non-involvement in the Syrian conflict.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's statement did not specify any actions his administration might take in response to the recent attack or his posture toward Assad. Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that the president's statement \"speaks for itself,\" and that Trump is consulting with his national security team, is \"alarmed\" by the situation, and will hold further discussions with allies regarding the appropriate response.\n\nIn 2013, as a private citizen, Trump expressed skepticism about U.S. involvement in Syria. In August of that year, following the U.S.'s conclusion that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons, Trump tweeted that the U.S. \"should stay the hell out of Syria.\" This sentiment remained consistent as the Syrian conflict escalated and the Obama administration considered a more active U.S. role.\n\nIn late August 2013, when the U.S. and international community concluded that the Syrian government had again used chemical weapons, the Obama administration was reportedly contemplating a military strike against Syria to send a message. Trump, however, questioned the wisdom of such a move.\n\nTrump's criticism of Obama's Syria policy dates back to 2013, when Obama drew a \"red line\" against the use of chemical weapons and did not follow through with military action. Trump's statement on Tuesday echoed this sentiment, arguing that Obama's inaction in 2012 had emboldened the Assad regime.\n\nIn 2013, as the U.S. and international community debated the use of force in Syria, Obama sought congressional approval for military action. This move was widely seen as a means to shift responsibility for the decision to escalate U.S. involvement in Syria onto Congress, as it became clear that Congress was unlikely to authorize force.\n\nTrump's tweets during this period focused on the potential negative impact of U.S. involvement on America's image. On August 30, 2013, a U.S. intelligence assessment found that more than 1,400 Syrians had been killed in the chemical weapons attack. The next day, Obama announced he would seek congressional approval for strikes in Syria, a move that Trump criticized for its potential to tarnish America's reputation.\n\nIn the end, the Obama administration reached a multinational agreement with Russia, in which Assad agreed to give up his chemical weapons. Trump's assessment of this agreement was not positive.\n\nLooking back, it appears that Trump's stance on Syria has remained consistent: he believes that the Obama administration's handling of the Syrian conflict made America look weak. This view is reflected in the statement Trump released on Tuesday. The future course of action remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Obama Abandons College Savings Tax Plan Following Intense Bipartisan Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, President Barack Obama has withdrawn a controversial plan to tax college savings accounts, known as 529 plans, following intense lobbying efforts from key members of his own party and bipartisan opposition.\n\nThe White House announced on Tuesday that it would not ask Congress to pass the 529 provision, allowing lawmakers to focus on a larger package of education tax relief with bipartisan support. The decision comes after a week of mounting opposition from both conservatives and mainstream groups, as well as some Democrats.\n\nThe proposal to tax 529 plans, which experts say primarily benefit upper-middle-class and wealthier families, was part of Obama's budget proposal, scheduled for release on Monday. The plan was intended to be a part of a broader proposal to shift taxes to the wealthy and provide benefits to lower-income individuals.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen reportedly lobbied the president on Air Force One, with Pelosi calling Van Hollen while Obama was en route from India to Saudi Arabia. Pelosi is said to have insisted that Obama drop the plan, scuttling what had been quickly labeled a disastrous policy.\n\nRepublicans had been critical of the plan from the start, with anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist labeling it a plan to hike \" taxes on middle-class families trying to save for their children's education.\" House Speaker John Boehner issued a statement on Monday, quoting state treasurers, local financial planners, and other experts around the country who said the proposal would hurt average Americans.\n\nDemocrats had also started to express concerns, with moderate Wisconsin Democrat Rep. Ron Kind joining with Republican Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins to propose a bill to expand and strengthen 529s. This legislation is expected to be brought to the floor in late February for a vote.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) criticized the White House for withdrawing the proposal, stating that Obama should work with Republicans to pass Rep. Lynn Jenkins' plan to strengthen and expand these important accounts.\n\nFormer White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein suggested that the White House might have been \"blindsided\" by the criticism of the tax plan, especially since it is a small part of a proposal that will boost college access for lower-income individuals. He also criticized the quick withdrawal, suggesting that the White House could have tweaked the plan to allow lower-income individuals to keep using the accounts.\n\nSome left-leaning groups had backed nixing the savings vehicle, citing the perception that it was widely used by the middle class. However, data shows that only 3 percent of families use the 529, and the vast majority make more than $200,000 a year. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, former chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, stated that the average amount saved in such plans by Iowa families is less than $20,000.\n\nGrassley added, \"It didn't make sense to attack a program that encourages savings. The tax code encourages all kinds of behavior, and saving for college is usually something everybody supports. The president's dropping his misguided plan is a victory for common sense.\"",
    " Title: Key Trump Allies Turn Critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing number of President Trump's most ardent supporters in the media have expressed dissatisfaction with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, following a series of critical remarks made by the President in an interview with The New York Times.\n\nIn the interview, published on Wednesday, Trump expressed regret for choosing Sessions as attorney general. The White House, however, stated on Thursday that Trump still has confidence in Sessions, but acknowledged that the President has the authority to dismiss him.\n\nDespite the White House's assertion of confidence in Sessions, several prominent pro-Trump voices have openly criticized the attorney general.\n\nLongtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told a Washingtonian writer on Wednesday that Sessions should resign. In a Facebook post on Thursday, GotNews writer Chuck Johnson suggested that Trump should fire Sessions and appoint Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as attorney general. Mike Cernovich, a right-wing blogger whose work has been publicly praised by Donald Trump Jr., described Sessions as \"out of touch\" and called for his removal.\n\nNew York Post columnist Michael Goodwin had previously called on Trump to fire Sessions, even before the NYT interview. Fox News host Sean Hannity and radio host Rush Limbaugh, while not explicitly calling for Sessions' resignation or dismissal, have also expressed criticism of the attorney general.\n\nHannity criticized Sessions on his radio show for not reopening the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. Limbaugh, in a similar vein, appeared to side with Trump over Sessions on Thursday.\n\nThe growing discontent among Trump's allies comes as the Russia investigation continues to loom over the White House. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is reportedly investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe White House has maintained that there was no collusion, and Sessions has recused himself from any investigation related to the 2016 campaign. However, the ongoing investigation and Sessions' recusal have been a source of frustration for many of Trump's supporters.\n\nAs the Russia investigation continues, it remains to be seen whether the pressure on Sessions from within the President's circle will lead to any changes in the administration's leadership at the Department of Justice.",
    " Title: Florida Senators Clash on Cuba Policy at Republican Debate in Miami\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during the Republican debate in Miami on Thursday, Florida Senator Marco Rubio criticized the Obama administration's policy of re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Rubio, who is of Cuban descent and is seeking to win the Florida primary on Tuesday, argued that the policy change had not benefited the Cuban people but rather allowed more money to flow to the Castro regime.\n\nRubio was asked about President Obama's upcoming trip to Cuba, which is still governed by the communist Castro regime. When asked why the United States should not engage further with Cuba, Rubio responded that the changes made under Obama had allowed money to flow to the Cuban government, and added, \"Nothing will change for the Cuban people... In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening.\"\n\nThe only result of \"the opening,\" Rubio said, was that the Cuban government had more sources of money. Donald Trump, who leads Rubio in polls in Florida, had previously said on the campaign trail that opening Cuba was fine. However, under attack in the Miami debate from all the candidates who trail him in the polls and the mounting delegate count, he said, \"I want a much better deal with Cuba\" and repeated a familiar line, \"We don't make any good deals.\"\n\n\"I do agree that something should take place,\" he added. \"After 50 years, it's enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal here.\"\n\nIn response, Rubio rattled off a list of anti-Castro grievances and was applauded wildly, drowning out attempts to ask Senator Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban father and an American mother, the next question. Cruz was asked if he would break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cruz said the question illustrated \"a real difference between us\" on foreign policy. Trump, Cruz said, supports the \"same basic trajectory\" of policy as Obama and Hillary Clinton, Obama's first secretary of state, have established.\n\nJohn Kasich, the fourth man onstage, was asked if he would encourage US companies to do business with Cuba. Kasich said he would not. Trump, meanwhile, repeated, \"We would not do the deal unless it would be a very good deal for us.\"\n\nThe debate highlighted the stark differences between the candidates on the issue of Cuba, with Rubio and Cruz taking a hardline stance against the Castro regime, while Trump and Kasich seemed more open to engaging with Cuba, albeit with conditions. The debate also underscored the importance of the Florida primary, with the state's large Cuban-American population playing a significant role in the Republican nomination process.",
    " Title: Social Media Backlash Against George Stephanopoulos Over Clinton Foundation Donations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets this week, George Stephanopoulos, the co-anchor of ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and host of \"This Week,\" faced a wave of criticism from Twitter users over his donations to the Clinton Foundation. The tweets, which ranged from accusations of bias to demands for his resignation, were met with a flurry of responses.\n\nOne user, @OrwellianApocalypse, tweeted, \"I'll sign a petition to have you fired, you Clinton hack.\" Another user, @MarkStickle, questioned Stephanopoulos's journalistic integrity, asking, \"Does Team Hillary write your copy, or do you simply clear it with them?\"\n\nThe controversy stems from Stephanopoulos's donation of $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation, as well as his listing as a notable member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2010 and 2011. ABC admitted that Stephanopoulos was a member, but claimed he did not pay any fees.

    " Title: NFL Owners and Players Discuss Social Justice Issues, Aim for Collaboration Amidst National Anthem Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The National Football League (NFL) held a meeting on Tuesday to address the ongoing controversy surrounding players protesting during the U.S. national anthem, with demonstrators rallying outside in solidarity. The league did not seek commitments from players to stop kneeling but instead focused on helping them in their political activism.\n\nOutside the Manhattan luxury hotel where team owners, players, and their union's leaders met, about two dozen people showed their backing for the protesting athletes, kneeling on the sidewalk while holding placards that read \"Take a knee against police brutality.\"\n\nThe small but growing number of players who have taken to kneeling during the national anthem are protesting the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters that the meeting was focused on discussing the issues that players have been trying to bring attention to, aiming to make communities better. Goodell appeared less interested in stifling the silent protests and instead praised players' character, saying he wanted to help their political activism.\n\nGoodell, who cut his news conference off after one question, said the league will meet again with players, probably in the next two weeks, and will spend more time talking to reporters when the two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.\n\nAn NFL spokesman had said the president might not see an outright ban on the national anthem protests soon, if ever, and predicted that the meeting would focus on ways for all sides to work together. Along those lines, team owners and 13 players had a \"productive meeting\" of their own earlier on Tuesday at the league offices about how to collaborate on positive social change and addressing inequality.\n\nThe NFL and the players' union released a joint statement saying, \"As we said last week, everyone who is part of our NFL community has a tremendous respect for our country, our flag, our anthem, and our military.\" The statement continued, \"In the best American tradition, we are coming together to find common ground and commit to the hard work required for positive change.\"\n\nMalcolm Jenkins, a player for the Philadelphia Eagles, told reporters that the two sides discussed how to amplify players' voices and make \"long, sustainable changes.\"\n\nPresident Trump has been vocal in his criticism of players who kneel during the anthem, saying they are disrespecting the country. Some team owners, including Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, sympathize with the president and have threatened to punish players who kneel.\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first popularized the gesture last year, was not invited to attend the meeting. Kaepernick, who is a free agent, said he settled on kneeling as a form of protest because it is widely seen as a gesture of respect.",
    " Title: China Announces Tariffs on US Goods Worth $60 Billion in Escalating Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic powerhouses, China has announced plans to impose tariffs on US products worth up to $60 billion. The Chinese government's decision comes in response to potential US tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nThe Chinese State Council Tariff Commission announced on Friday that it would impose tariffs of 25%, 20%, 10%, and 5% on the targeted US products. The commission stated that the US, in violation of the bilateral consensus reached after multiple rounds of negotiations, has unilaterally escalated trade frictions.\n\nChina has listed 5,207 US products that will be subject to these tariffs, aiming to safeguard its own legitimate interests. The products include meat, coffee, nuts, alcoholic drinks, minerals, chemicals, leather products, wood products, machinery, furniture, auto parts, and more.\n\nIn response, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, stated that instead of retaliating, China should address the longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices.\n\nThe US and China trade goods and services worth approximately $650 billion annually, making it the largest trading relationship between two countries worldwide. However, China exports far more to the US than the other way around, making it more challenging for the country to counteract US tariffs.\n\nThese new tariffs will affect about 38% of all American exports to China, which are worth approximately $170 billion in total.\n\nTrade tensions between the US and China have been escalating since April 2017, when President Donald Trump directed the US Commerce Department to investigate whether imports of steel and aluminum from China and other countries threatened national security. This investigation led to tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China and other countries in March. China responded with equal measures.\n\nIn July, the US imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods to pressure China into abandoning what the Trump administration describes as unfair practices such as stealing intellectual property. China retaliated with penalties of an equal scale, targeting American products such as motorcycles and communications satellites.\n\nThe most recent threat from the Trump administration came this week, when it warned that it could impose steeper tariffs than originally planned on another batch of imports from China. The White House had previously considered imposing a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods; under the new plan, tariffs of 25% would be applied.\n\nProtectionist moves by the US have also drawn responses from other major trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, who have retaliated with their own tariffs in response to US taxes on steel and aluminum.",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Announces War Powers Resolution to Limit President Trump's Military Actions Against Iran\n\nIn a move aimed at curbing President Donald Trump's military actions against Iran, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced overnight that the House will introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution. The resolution, similar to a Senate resolution to be introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), seeks to reassert Congress's oversight responsibilities and potentially limit the President's military actions regarding Iran.\n\nPelosi's announcement comes in response to President Trump's decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that resulted in the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force. Critics, including Pelosi and other Democrats, have claimed that Trump did not properly notify Congress in advance, and have expressed concerns about the risk of escalation in the region.\n\nIn a letter to fellow Democrats, Pelosi wrote that the resolution, if passed, would mandate that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration's military hostilities with regard to Iran would cease within 30 days. The first War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 to prevent presidents from using the military without congressional approval.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House sent Congress formal notification of the drone strike under the War Powers Act, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The notification, required by law within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into an armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, had to be signed and sent to Congress.\n\nHowever, the document sent to congressional leadership, the House speaker, and the Senate president pro tempore was entirely classified, according to a senior aide for the Democrats and a congressional aide speaking to the AP. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also sent a letter to the president Sunday asking him to fully declassify the notification, claiming that \"there appears to be no legitimate justification\" for keeping it secret.\n\nTrump has threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani's death, and has claimed that his online posts provide notification to Congress. In a tweet Sunday afternoon, Trump stated, \"legal notice is not required\" for him to take additional action, but also claimed that his online posts provided notification to Congress that he \"will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner\" if Iran attacks \"any U.S. person or target.\"\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate and avenge Soleimani's death, and has announced that they will be abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, signaling threats of further nuclear proliferation. Trump had tweeted Saturday that even Iran's cultural sites were potential targets for U.S. military action. \"They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It does not work that way,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Iraqi lawmakers approved a resolution calling to expel U.S. troops from the country, who were sent there more than four years ago to aid in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.",
    " Title: New York City's Jewish Community Faces Uncertainty After Recent Hate Crimes, Questioning Motives and Stereotypes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of New York City, the Jewish community is grappling with a series of alleged hate crimes, including vandalism against Jewish institutions and a violent attack on a rabbi's home in Monsey during the seventh night of Hanukkah. The assailant, Grafton Thomas, is accused of entering the rabbi's home around 10:00 p.m. and slashing several people with a longsword.\n\nThe motivations behind Thomas' actions remain unclear, with friends reporting that he suffers from mental illness. However, his race, as an African American man, complicates the narrative often associated with a surge in anti-Semitism in recent years, which is frequently linked to white supremacy, the alt-right, or President Donald Trump's rhetoric.\n\nIn May, during a U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties hearing, concerns about a rise in white nationalism and hate crimes were discussed. However, the perpetrators of these crimes in New York City are predominantly black or Hispanic, as noted by Tablet's Armin Rose in a July piece about anti-Semitism in New York City.\n\nThe connection between anti-Semitism and far-right extremism is well-documented, but it's essential to acknowledge that contempt for Jewish people exists across various ideological and racial-identity-based extremes. Campus leftism, progressive activism, and black nationalist cults like the Black Hebrew Israelites have also been linked to anti-Semitic incidents.\n\nThomas' race does not necessarily indicate a connection to a specific ideology or activism for a leftist or black nationalist cause. In fact, it's plausible that he had no broader motivation, as murder is often non-ideological.\n\nBatya Ungar-Sargon, writing for The Forward, noted that \"there is little evidence that these attacks are ideologically motivated, at least in terms of the ideologies of hate we are most familiar with.\"\n\nAs the left and right grapple with anti-Semitism within their respective spheres, it's crucial to avoid ignoring or downplaying incidents when the perpetrators contradict the dominant narrative. The same goes for the right, which should not turn a blind eye to anti-Semitism among its own ranks.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to demand accurate reporting on the scale of the problem, as nationally, it's not clear that anti-Semitic violence is rising dramatically. The NYPD reported a 53% increase in anti-Semitic incidents in New York City from 2018 to 2019, but the majority of these incidents are classified as \"criminal mischief,\" which typically refers to vandalism and graffiti. Only 13% of incidents involved violence.\n\nIn the face of these troubling events, it's crucial to remain vigilant, informed, and empathetic, ensuring that we're not succumbing to unfounded panic or ignoring the complexities of the issue at hand.",
    " Title: New York State Senator and City Councilman Accused in Plot to Purchase GOP Spot in NYC Mayoral Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, New York State Sen. Malcolm Smith, a Democrat, was arrested Tuesday morning and led away in handcuffs from his Queens home. The arrest stems from allegations that he attempted to illegally purchase a spot on the Republican ticket for the 2013 New York City mayoral election.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Smith conspired with a cooperating witness, an undercover F.B.I. agent posing as a wealthy real estate developer, to bribe leaders of Republican county committees in New York's five boroughs. The bribes were intended to secure the necessary certificates authorizing him to run for mayor as a Republican, despite his registered Democratic status.\n\nCity Councilman Daniel Halloran, a Republican, was also arrested Tuesday, along with four other local politicians from the New York metropolitan area. Halloran, according to the complaint, is alleged to have quarterbacked the effort to find party chairmen in the state who were open to receiving bribes.\n\nHalloran, in exchange for his support of Smith's bid for the GOP nomination, is said to have allegedly received $20,500, while two other officials were to allegedly receive $40,000 in bribes with a promise of an additional $40,000.\n\nSmith's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, stated that Smith \"is a dedicated and highly respected public servant and he steadfastly denies these charges.\"\n\nSmith, who first won election to the state senate in 2000, was the state senate's president pro tempore when Democrats controlled the chamber in 2008-10. In recent years, however, he has often been at odds with his fellow Democrats.\n\nCurrent Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) is prevented from seeking a fourth term. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn is thought to be the leading contender for the Democratic nomination. The Republican frontrunner, according to the New York Daily News, is Joe Lhota, who was a deputy mayor during the administration of Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe full extent of the alleged conspiracy remains to be seen, as the investigation continues. The arrests have cast a shadow over the upcoming mayoral race, with the city's political landscape now under scrutiny.",
    " Title: China Vows Retaliation Against U.S. Tariffs, Pushing Back on Link to Hong Kong Unrest\n\nThe ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China has taken a turn as China has called the looming U.S. tariffs a violation of agreements reached by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. In response, Beijing has vowed retaliation and has also pushed back on Trump's effort to link the trade war with the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the State Council Tariff Committee, which has overseen tit-for-tat retaliation, stated that China \"has no choice but to take necessary measures to retaliate,\" without specifying what the nation would do. The U.S. plans for 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports have reportedly taken the two countries off the track of resolving their dispute through negotiation.\n\nU.S. stocks finished the day higher after getting whipsawed throughout the session as Treasury yields plummeted to levels unseen in years. Trade headlines set investors on edge, though volatility has gripped markets for most of August since Trump escalated his spat with China.\n\nTrump announced the tariffs set for Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. China has halted purchases of agricultural goods and allowed the yuan to weaken. However, top negotiators held a phone call earlier this week, and the U.S. delayed the imposition of some of the new import taxes. Negotiators also agreed to have another call in the coming two weeks, and people familiar said earlier the Chinese delegation is sticking to their plan to travel to the U.S. in September for face-to-face meetings.\n\nChina's statement indicates that Beijing doesn't think the U.S. delaying some of the tariffs is enough. China is sticking to the position that no new duties should be imposed at all, according to Zhou Xiaoming, a former Ministry of Commerce official and diplomat. China's retaliation \"may not be limited to tariffs,\" he said.\n\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper, echoed that sentiment. He tweeted before the Thursday announcement that China wants both sides to respect the consensus reached when Trump and Xi met in Osaka in June. \"I doubt the Chinese side will resume large-scale purchase of U.S. farm goods under the current circumstances,\" he said.\n\nLess than 12 hours before the Chinese statement on retaliation, Trump appeared to float the possibility of another meeting with Xi. In a flurry of tweets, he defended his tariff decisions, praised Xi, and urged the Chinese president to \"humanely\" resolve the protests that have gripped Hong Kong for more than two months.\n\nChina's position on the trade negotiations has been consistent and clear, Hua Chunying, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman, said in a written comment to a question about Trump's tweet. \"We hope that the U.S. side will do as what they say,\" she said. China's position on the Hong Kong issue has also been consistent, with the Chinese government viewing it as an internal matter.\n\nTrump ended his Twitter post with an apparent overture to Xi -- writing \"Personal meeting?\" -- without clarifying whether he was suggesting another summit. Hua said the two leaders \"have always kept in touch through meetings, calls, and letters.\"\n\nThe trade negotiations between the U.S. and China remain a complex and evolving situation, with both sides expressing a desire to find a mutually acceptable solution. The ongoing unrest in Hong Kong, however, has added a new layer of complexity to the negotiations, with Trump linking the two issues and China pushing back against such a connection.",
    " Title: Sequestration Threatens U.S. Military Readiness, Leaving Forces Unprepared for Combat Missions\n\nThe automatic budget cuts known as sequestration could leave the U.S. military unprepared for the most challenging combat missions, according to the Pentagon. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told Congress in April that the military is \"eating its seed corn.\"\n\nThe cuts will fall heavily on maintenance and training, which further erodes the readiness of the force and will be costly to regain in the future, Hagel said. \"As the service chiefs have said, we are consuming our readiness,\" he added.\n\nThe Air Force is in a special bind. Cuts in flying hours mean that pilots cannot do the thing they need to practice most: flying. At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, training flights are part of the daily routine. F-15 fighter jets roll down the flight line and launch into a cloudy sky.\n\nThe base is home to the Air Combat Command's Fourth Fighter Wing, which is made up of four squadrons of fighters. They practice and practice so they can be ready to deploy anywhere in the world, at any time. But the skies are a little quieter now because the leadership has been told to save money.\n\n\"We were told to cut our flying budget roughly in half,\" Lt. Col. James Howard says. Because of that order, Howard says, he had to ground the 336th Fighter Squadron so that the other units on this base could keep flying.\n\nThe longer Howard's pilots remain idle, the longer it will take for them to get ready to fly again. Fighter pilots must fly and drill their skills on a regular basis, from dogfighting to helping ground troops under fire. Otherwise, they lose their certification.\n\n\"All those skills are extremely perishable,\" Howard says. Most pilots, he says, are required to do eight to nine flights per month to maintain readiness status.\n\nSome Pentagon budget hawks say these complaints are just part of the military's propaganda effort to avoid budget cuts. They say the military is hoping to win sympathy by deliberately cancelling high-profile programs, like appearances by the Blue Angels and Fleet Week in New York.\n\nThe cancellations make it easier for Pentagon-backers like Republican Sen. John McCain to argue that the military should be protected from these automatic cuts. On Meet the Press last month, McCain said Congress should do for the military what it did for the Federal Aviation Administration after travelers complained about flight delays caused by budget cuts.\n\n\"I think we have our priorities a little bit skewed here. Look, I'm for giving the FAA flexibility, but I also want to give the military flexibility. And I don't want the sequestration cuts to be as deep as they are on national defense,\" McCain said.\n\nThe problem right now is that Washington still looks at sequestration as a temporary problem. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says Congress and the military are banking on the chance that next year the budget will be back to normal.\n\n\"You may be willing to make a strategic choice and say, 'I will accept a lower level of readiness for some period of time just so that I have the option of turning back on that readiness quickly and having all of these aircraft and these pilots ready to go,'\" Harrison says.\n\nIn other words, it could be better to ground a few pilots now, hoping you won't have to make permanent cuts, like having fewer pilots or fewer planes. The Pentagon hopes to get limited relief soon by asking Congress for permission to shift money around in order to protect top priorities like flying time. But the long-term solution is a budget deal\u2014which is not even visible on the horizon.",
    " Title: Senate Rule Change Accelerates Obama's Judicial Appointments, Reshaping Courts for Years to Come\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate, traditionally known for its gridlock, has been actively approving judges who will shape the law for future generations under President Barack Obama's administration. This shift is a direct result of a rule change implemented by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in November, which eased the approval process for most of Obama's judicial nominees.\n\nSince the rule change, Democrats have confirmed numerous new judges, granting them lifetime appointments that will extend the administration's influence for years to come. Over a roughly equivalent period during the 113th Congress, the Senate confirmed 36 district and circuit court judges before the rules change and 68 after, according to Senate statistics.\n\nRepublicans have opposed Democrats at every turn, using their remaining procedural tools to delay the quick approval of judges and many executive branch nominees. However, the era of lengthy confirmation battles appears to be over, as all nominees, save for those to the Supreme Court, now only require a bare majority for approval following the Democrats' use of the \"nuclear option\" to alter the rules.\n\nAs a result, Obama is catching up to the judicial confirmation records of his immediate predecessors and reshaping the balance of the courts. The impact of these liberal-leaning justices, Democrats argue, will be more significant than the small number of major new laws passed by this Congress.\n\n\"The rules change has made a huge difference,\" said Marge Baker, a vice president at People for the American Way. \"The legacy of this Congress has been the impact that the president and the Senate have made with judicial vacancies.\"\n\nBrad Woodhouse, President of Americans United for Change, expressed support for the rules change, stating, \"If the question is whether I would want to see it done again: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\"\n\nHowever, the rule change has also had consequences. Republicans argue that it has \"chilled\" the legislative climate, and the Senate has been in a legislative deep freeze since the change. Democrats have faced retribution from the GOP, with Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) citing the \"nuclear option\" as the reason for blocking a raft of Obama's ambassadorial choices before the Senate recessed for August.\n\nThe rule change's impact on the Senate's efficiency is a topic of debate. Confirmation rates have increased, but the process still moves slowly. Republicans have consistently voted against nominees that would have been blocked or delayed under the old rules, but it is impossible to determine which votes were in protest of the rules change and which were in protest of individual nominees.\n\nDemocratic aides and researchers argue that at least 20 key judicial and executive nominees would have been blocked or delayed for months before November under the old rules. In their view, Jeh Johnson would not be Homeland Security secretary, John Koskinen would still be waiting for a vote, and former Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) would still be in Congress, not leading the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\n\"Unquestionably things had to change,\" said Stephen Spaulding, a counsel for Common Cause, a member of a coalition called Fix the Senate Now.\n\nRepublicans argue that the rule change has empowered Obama and weakened the Senate's role as a check on the president. They claim that the Senate is less efficient than it was a year ago, with each nomination consuming an hour or more of the Senate's time.\n\nThe rule change's long-term impact on the balance of power and the efficiency of the Senate remains to be seen.",
    " Title: National Poll Shows Ben Carson's Support Waning Amidst Doubts on Experience and Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nA new national poll released today indicates a decline in support for 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson, with the neurosurgeon falling from the top of the race for the Republican nomination. The Quinnipiac University poll, published today, shows Carson garnering 16 percent support, a drop of 7 percentage points in the last month, placing him behind frontrunner Donald Trump by double digits. Trump leads with 27 percent support, while Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz follow closely with 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively. All other GOP candidates earned 5 percent or less.\n\nCarson, who was neck-and-neck with Trump in early November, is now locked in a battle with Rubio and Cruz, both of whom are seeing their highest support in months. The increased focus on terrorism and foreign affairs following the tragic attacks in Paris has prompted a new chapter in the campaign.\n\nThe poll reveals that only 42 percent of Republican voters now believe Carson has the right experience to be president, a significant drop from 64 percent just four weeks ago. Furthermore, only six in ten say he has strong leadership qualities, down from 76 percent of Republicans in early November. Carson's fall has also affected other areas, with double-digit drops in areas like honesty and trustworthiness and overall favorability, where Carson had been sky high.\n\nIn a hypothetical general election match-up, Carson's 10-point lead over Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton from last month has evaporated. The new poll shows 46 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Carson, respectively. Clinton also improved in hypothetical faceoffs with Cruz and Rubio.\n\nCarson's lead among independents, which was 25 points last month, has disintegrated to just a single point. Clinton now leads Carson by 16 points among women, where they had been neck-and-neck just four weeks ago. Clinton still holds a wide lead on the Democratic nomination race, ahead 60 to 30 percent over Sen. Bernie Sanders, with Clinton solidifying support among women and liberals, according to the poll.\n\nThe new numbers were finalized before Carson's recent trip to Jordan to meet with Syrian refugees, a move aimed at bolstering his foreign policy credentials in the wake of the Paris attacks. However, Carson's support has dropped equally across the board, particularly among evangelical voters, where he dropped 13 points.\n\nTrump remains steady on top of the national polls, the undisputed frontrunner less than two months from the Iowa caucuses. The new national numbers come after a recent Quinnipiac poll in Iowa showed Carson giving way to Sen. Ted Cruz, who had run neck-and-neck with Trump atop the polls in the crucial first-in-the-nation state.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Condemns White Nationalist Robocalls Ahead of Primary Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of Wisconsin's primary election, Republican Governor Scott Walker has found himself in an unexpected predicament, as a white nationalist super PAC's robocalls, featuring coded language, have stirred controversy in the state. The calls, orchestrated by the American National Super PAC and its founder, William Johnson, have been criticized for their implicit racial undertones, a stark contrast to the GOP-controlled state's recent voter-ID law, which threatens to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of minority voters.\n\nThe robocall, narrated by an elderly woman, subtly promotes Donald Trump, promising that he will \"respect all women and help preserve western civilization.\" In the world of white nationalists, this is a veiled message that Trump will maintain the status quo, keeping out perceived threats such as Latino immigrants and black welfare recipients.\n\nThe calls, while relatively mild compared to Johnson's previous efforts, have caused a stir, particularly given Walker's political history in a state that has long been racially polarized. The governor, who built his power base in the state's suburbs, has been criticized for his policies that disproportionately affect inner-city African-Americans, such as cuts to public transportation and advocacy for private-school vouchers and prison privatization.\n\nThe New Republic, in a deep dive two years ago, revealed a city and its suburbs that are among the most segregated in the country. The report highlighted the high rate of white flight, which tripled the population of three rural counties around Milwaukee, while the percentage of African-American residents in those counties is under 2 percent. The black poverty rate within the city is the second-highest in the country.\n\nThe environment in which Walker has risen through the ranks of the Republican Party is one that has fueled racial polarization, with talk-radio hosts like Charlie Sykes contributing to the white resentment politics that have gained national prominence over the last thirty years. Sykes, who regularly refers to Michelle Obama as \"Mooch,\" has grown rich by spewing racial divisiveness, and has frequently featured Walker as a guest.\n\nGiven this context, it is unsurprising that a white nationalist like William Johnson would see potential in Wisconsin for promoting Donald Trump. Yet, Walker and some of his allies in the local media have criticized Trump as a big-city outsider, with Sykes, ironically, lamenting that Trump is failing to adhere to Wisconsin's \"tradition of civility and decency.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the robocalls is further complicated by the fact that Wisconsin's new voter-ID law is in effect for the first time during this election. The law, which could disenfranchise as many as 300,000 mostly minority and student voters, is part of a broader Republican effort to limit the voting power of traditional Democratic constituencies. Since the law is a result of the Supreme Court's weakening of the Voting Rights Act, it is difficult to view it as a race-blind measure, as defenders of voter-ID laws often claim, when its primary effect is to disenfranchise minority voters.\n\nWhile Walker and his allies may not see themselves as racists, the racist effects of their policies and the poison they spread to suburban commuters cannot be ignored. Donald Trump has brought the inherent racism of their worldview out into the open, attracting the support of outright racists like William Johnson. In the end, it is a stark reminder that, in politics, what is often implicit can suddenly become explicit.",
    " Title: US Stocks Swoon Amidst Global Market Downturn, but Experts Urge Cautious Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestors across the globe, including those in the United States, experienced a turbulent Monday as the US stocks followed Asian markets downward. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by a staggering 1,000 points at the opening, signaling a concerning start to the trading day. However, the threat of a global recession is not synonymous with the current economic turmoil in China.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day with a 3.6 percent decline, amounting to a loss of 588 points, closing at 15,871.35. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index came close to a 4 percent decline for the day. The selloff followed a five-day period during which the Dow lost 1,000 points.\n\nOutside the US, declines were observed in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong, with losses on the order of 5 percent. China's benchmark stock index plunged by 8.5 percent, prompting a \"Black Monday\" label in Shanghai news reports.\n\nFor shaken investors outside China, analysts advise keeping Monday's swoon in perspective. Several factors support this perspective, with a US domestic economy that is still demonstrating some forward momentum. While acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the pace of global economic growth, many forecasters argue that the visible risks today are not of the global-recession magnitude.\n\nThe latest reading on economic growth, due this week, is expected to show US expansion at a pace slightly above 3 percent annualized. The volume of home sales ticked up positively in the latest monthly report, reaching the highest rate in eight years, and the job market has shown improvement, bringing unemployment down to 5.3 percent of the labor force.\n\nWhile the effects of what happens in China may not stay in China, the impacts should not be exaggerated. The cooling of China's economy is more likely to affect emerging-market nations than developed ones, according to global economists. The decline in China's currency puts pressure on other export-oriented economies, but for the US, this might result in only small economic effects, such as modestly weaker export opportunities to emerging nations, offset by some positive benefits from lower commodity prices.\n\nVolatility in the stock market, while unsettling, serves a useful purpose by avoiding market bubbles, analysts say. Sizable downward \"corrections\" in share prices are a feature, not a bug, in a healthy stock market. For long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. With the S&P index down more than 10 percent from levels seen in July, some investment strategists see this as a good buying opportunity or perhaps getting close to it.\n\nFor young or middle-aged workers with a steady paycheck, the larger point may be the long-term track record of the stock market delivering positive returns for investors. However, for millions of Americans, saving enough money to invest at all remains a challenge. According to one bankrate.com survey earlier this year, more than half of Americans have no money in stocks or stock mutual funds.\n\nFor those saving for retirement, another hurdle is a \"twice-burned\" aversion to stocks, including among Millennials who were vicarious witnesses to the dotcom bust and Great Recession.

The book, while providing an explanation and narrative for the ongoing scrum between the president and the press, or as Kurtz frames it, \"the war over the truth,\" falls short in its critique of the media while offering a lenient portrayal of the president's actions.\n\nKurtz, a Fox News commentator, apportions guilt between both sides, but he is quicker to point a finger at the media for having discounted Trump's chances for winning in 2016 than he is to lay blame at the Trump's feet for his embrace of alternative facts as a new reality form. The book portrays Trump as a surrogate for his electoral base of disenchanted white working-class voters and therefore should be afforded greater patience, even as he tramples on the truth.\n\n\"Media Madness\" acknowledges that Trump is \"loose with his language,\" fails to \"vet\" his pronouncements, and \"sometimes regurgitates half-baked comments.\" However, Kurtz places the onus on the media, contending that it mistakenly takes Trump literally while arguing that Trump's casualness does not always merit a press-driven fusillade.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it requires a degree of calibration usually found among fine-precision instruments, and definitely not in Kurtz's own body of work. For the record, the Daily Beast ejected Kurtz from its employ for journalistic shoddiness. Beyond that, Trump's own flexibility with the truth helped trigger special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and possible obstruction charges.\n\nThe book sheds light on the chaotic and often surreal atmosphere within the White House, which at times resembles a cross between Lord of the Flies and Goodfellas. Scenes such as Trump's outburst towards former press secretary Sean Spicer, yelling, \"I know how to fucking take care of myself!\" and his attack on the New York Times, are portrayed in vivid detail.\n\nHowever, \"Media Madness\" fails to provide a balanced critique of the media and the president. It captures the mainstream's visible biases but lets the president off way too easily. Kurtz bemoans the media's tarnished reputation but says little of Trump's. That's called stacking the deck.",
    " Title: FBI Surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. and Donald Trump: A Historical Parallel and Media Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a striking parallel to the surveillance of Donald Trump during the 2016 election, it has been revealed that the FBI also conducted extensive surveillance on civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s. This surveillance, which included electronic surveillance and the collection of salacious material, has been met with a stark contrast in media coverage between the two figures.\n\nDavid Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Martin Luther King Jr., detailed his shocking discoveries about the civil rights leader's private behavior in an article commissioned by the UK's Guardian. However, the Guardian ultimately decided to pull the article with a kill fee. Garrow also experienced similar rejections from the Atlantic magazine and the Washington Post, both of which he had written for previously.\n\nThe revelations, published by Standpoint on Thursday, paint a disturbing picture of King's behind-closed-doors behavior, with the FBI bugging hotel rooms where he slept and expected privacy. The FBI's actions, which included listening to what they characterized as a rape without intervening, expose the prurient nature of the investigation.\n\nRoger Simon, a 1960s civil rights activist, writes at PJMedia that the FBI, from J. Edgar Hoover to James Comey, has always been a \"government unto itself.\" Simon calls for a \"mammoth house cleaning\" of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nDespite the revelations, King's antagonists remain mostly anonymous and beyond accountability. The allegations have made headlines around the world, but have been met with a curiously incurious response from the American media. American journalists, who normally salivate over throwing mud on historical figures, have balked at reporting on the findings of a writer to whom they once awarded a Pulitzer.\n\nThe allegations against King include participating in a sexual encounter with multiple women, offering advice during the encounter, and allegedly participating in an orgy the following day. Garrow, who has access to FBI summaries of audio surveillance of King, estimates that there were 40-45 participants, not the 10-12 initially believed. The tapes remain under lock-and-key at the National Archives until 2027.\n\nGarrow's research, which relies on FBI summaries of audio surveillance, often includes gossip, rumors, and lies told by informants. However, the level of authenticity of the information likely rises due to its origin from audio tapes. The summaries may exaggerate the bad, and in some cases criminal, behavior on the tapes. But did agents really just make it all up? Some of the participants still live to refute or corroborate the allegations.\n\nThe allegations against Martin Luther King Jr. have raised questions about his historical stature and have been compared to the Harvey Weinstein scandal. However, the journalistic indifference to these allegations, compared to the media frenzy surrounding similar allegations against Donald Trump, highlights a stark double standard in media coverage.",
    " Title: Minnesota Politicians Allegedly Assaulted in Political Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Republican politicians in Minnesota have reported physical attacks in the past few days, according to separate reports from The Associated Press and the Star Tribune.\n\nState Representative Sarah Anderson (R) was attacked on Sunday by an unidentified male who she confronted after finding him damaging her yard signs. Anderson told the AP that police have a tentative identification of the man who allegedly punched her in the arm during the confrontation, and they plan to interview him.\n\nAnother Republican, Minnesota House District 15b candidate Shane Mekeland, told the Star Tribune he was attacked on Friday during a campaign event at a bar by a \"much bigger person\" who left him with a concussion. Mekeland said his attacker made a statement, although not specifically aligned with either party, that indicated he was angry at Mekeland for supposedly abandoning the middle class.\n\n\"It was a typical politically charged statement \u2014 not necessarily one way or the other, just a statement in general,\" Mekeland told the Star Tribune. \"But it was in reference to politicians not caring about the middle class.\"\n\nMekeland emphasized the importance of staying calm and being civil, citing his parents' long marriage despite their political differences.\n\nSome Democrats, including Representative Maxine Waters (Calif.) and former Attorney General Eric Holder, have faced criticism in recent months for calls to protest GOP candidates and lawmakers. Holder, who served under former President Obama, responded on Twitter last week, stating, \"OK, stop the fake outrage. I\u2019m obviously not advocating violence. (In fact, when I was AG, violent crime in the US was historically low.)\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"Republicans are undermining our democracy, and Democrats need to be tough, proud, and stand up for the values we believe in - the end.\"",
    " Title: Walter Shaub, Director of Office of Government Ethics, to Resign, Citing Desire for Greater Freedom to Push for Ethics Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter posted to his Twitter account on Thursday, Walter Shaub, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), announced his resignation, effective July 19. Shaub's tenure, marked by frequent clashes with the Trump administration, will conclude six months before his term was set to end.\n\nShaub, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's ethics practices, will join the Campaign Legal Center as senior director of ethics. The group, which advocates for transparency and ethics in government, confirmed the move.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, Shaub and the administration have been at odds over various ethics issues, including the steps taken by the president to distance himself from his business empire and the administration's disclosure of ethics waivers for former lobbyists serving in the White House.\n\nIn an email to The Wall Street Journal, Shaub stated that he was not pushed out by the White House and that he was leaving before the end of his term because he felt the Campaign Legal Center would offer him the best platform and he wanted to take the job before it was filled. The new role, he said, will allow greater freedom to push for changes to federal ethics rules.\n\nThe White House, in a statement, said it accepted Shaub's resignation and \"appreciates his service.\" The president plans to nominate a successor \"in short order,\" the White House added.\n\nThe OGE, which aims to prevent conflicts of interest for government employees, has limited means to enforce federal ethics rules, aside from publicly raising questions about possible conflicts.\n\nShortly after Trump's election victory, Shaub made it clear that he wouldn't hesitate to criticize the president over ethics issues. In November, the ethics office sent a series of tweets at Trump urging him to divest fully from his business interests. In January, Shaub denounced as insufficient Trump's proposal to guard against conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump placed his assets into a trust and turned over management of his business to his adult sons, but retained ownership of the business. He can withdraw funds from the trust if its trustees\u2014his eldest son and a longtime company lawyer\u2014deem it appropriate.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Shaub again criticized the president for not taking adequate steps to distance himself from his business. Asked whether Trump and his family were using the presidency to enrich themselves, Shaub said, \"I can\u2019t know what their intention is. I know that the effect is that there\u2019s an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency.\"\n\nIn March, Shaub criticized the White House for not taking more aggressive action against senior adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers in a television interview to \"go buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff,\" referring to the brand owned by Trump's elder daughter. The White House said it had counseled Conway on the issue and determined she was unlikely to again break the federal law barring government officials from endorsing brands.\n\nIn May, Shaub issued an unusually forceful response to an effort by the White House to block the ethics office's attempt to obtain its ethics waivers, which allow administration officials to work on issues they handled in their previous private-sector jobs. Shaub declined the request that his office suspend its effort to obtain the waivers and included hundreds of pages of material backing up his right to request them. The White House ultimately provided the waivers to the agency, which publicly disclosed them.\n\nThe departure of Shaub, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2013, means that Trump has the power to appoint a successor. A director must be confirmed by the Senate and is appointed to serve a five-year term. Shaub's term was set to expire in January.\n\nDon Fox, who served as the ethics office's general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, said Shaub was \"far more outspoken\" than his predecessors about \"what he perceived as the ethical shortcomings of this administration.\"\n\n\"Walt spoke out because he felt he had to,\" said Fox, adding he couldn't think of another administration \"that was ever this disdainful of government ethics.\"\n\nIn a statement released by the Campaign Legal Center, Shaub said he hoped in his new role to bolster federal ethics rules.\n\n\"In working with the current administration, it has become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program,\" he said. \"I look forward to working toward that aim at Campaign Legal Center, as well as working on ethics reforms at all levels of government.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Push Forward with Full Repeal of Affordable Care Act Amidst Democratic Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has become a familiar political theater, House Republican leaders are pushing ahead with a vote on Wednesday to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, following a debate on the repeal measure on Tuesday. This is the second full repeal vote in the chamber, two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld most of the law as constitutional.\n\nThe vote, however, is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, and if it were to reach President Obama's desk, he has vowed to veto it. Since 2011, the House has held 29 other votes aimed at dismantling specific parts of the law.\n\nThe House Rules Committee has allotted five hours of floor debate for the latest measure, with four and a half hours of debate already completed on Tuesday. The remaining time is set aside for the day of the vote.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the Republican efforts, accusing them of wasting time with political theater instead of focusing on economic issues. Representative Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said, \"We could spend five hours talking about jobs. We could consider a jobs plan that the president offered before this very body. But we won't, because we have to go repeal health care again for the thirty-first time.\"\n\nDemocrats also argue that the Supreme Court's ruling to preserve the law indicates that Republicans should turn their attention to other issues. Representative Donna Edwards, D-Md., said, \"It's time for Republicans to move on.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, maintain their stance on the issue, which they believe helped secure their majority during the 2010 midterm elections. They argue that the high court only declared the law constitutional, not good policy.\n\n\"House Republicans promised the American people that if granted the majority, we would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich. \"Let's face it, Obamacare is nothing like what was promised.\"\n\nRepublicans have vowed to continue their efforts to repeal the law. Representative Lee Terry, R-Neb., said, \"I have voted to repeal this 30 times, and I will keep doing it until we get it right.\"",
    " Title: Republican Leadership Remains Silent as Trump Threatens Constitutional Crisis Over Mueller\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of President Donald Trump's escalating attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Republican leadership appears to be treading cautiously, with many key figures remaining silent on the issue.\n\nAs the New York Times reports, there has been no comment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John Thune, Richard Burr, Chuck Grassley, Kevin McCarthy, Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, or a majority of the other Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan's response was a non-committal statement, saying that \"As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job.\" This statement, while seemingly supportive of Mueller, does not indicate any concrete action should Trump move to fire the special counsel.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, in an appearance on Meet the Press, expressed confidence in Mueller's investigation, but did not offer any specific actions he would take if Trump were to fire the special counsel. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford described Trump as \"exceptionally frustrated,\" but did not offer any solutions to address this frustration.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) offered a more nuanced perspective, stating that Republicans view the potential firing of Mueller as a \"massive red line\" that should not be crossed. However, Flake also admitted that action would only be taken after the horse has already left the barn, as it were.\n\nIn the absence of clear leadership from the Republican side, some are calling for action to be taken to prevent a potential constitutional crisis. The call to action is growing louder, with many urging voters to support Democratic candidates in key districts and states in the upcoming midterm elections.",
    " Title: Five Memorable Anecdotes from Hillary Clinton's Book on the 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her new book, \"What Happened,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shares personal insights and experiences from the two years leading up to and following her 2016 presidential election loss. Here are five of the most memorable anecdotes shared by Clinton in her book.\n\n1. President Obama's Encouragement\n\nClinton reveals that President Obama signaled early on in 2013 and 2014 that she should run for president. Obama's support meant a great deal to Clinton, as she wrote, \"I knew President Obama thought the world of his Vice President, Joe Biden, and was close to some other potential candidates, so his vote of confidence meant a great deal to me.\"\n\n2. Advice from Former President George W. Bush\n\nAs she decided whether to attend President Trump's inauguration, Clinton sought advice from a surprising source: former President George W. Bush. Bush, who had his own family disagreements with Trump, advised Clinton to go to the inauguration, arguing it was for the good of the country.\n\n3. Mistaken Identity\n\nClinton mistook former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) for Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus when he approached her on Inauguration Day. Chaffetz, who had long sought to make a political issue of Clinton's handling of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, captured the moment on Twitter. Clinton admitted that she \"came this close\" to tweeting back at the congressman, \"To be honest, I thought you were Reince.\"\n\n4. An Unusual Introduction\n\nDuring the lunch at the Capitol following the swearing-in ceremony, Clinton describes an awkward encounter with Trump's soon-to-be Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who had previously called Clinton the \"antichrist\" in 2014. Clinton wrote that Zinke introduced her to his wife, to which she responded, \"You know Congressman, I'm not actually the antichrist.\"\n\n5. Standing by Huma Abedin\n\nAfter the FBI reopened an investigation to examine emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop, Clinton wrote that some people thought she should fire longtime adviser Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife. Clinton, however, refused to fire Abedin, writing, \"Not a chance. She had done nothing wrong and was an invaluable member of my team. I stuck by her the same way she has always stuck by me.\"\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning on election night, Clinton wrote that she and her husband were alone, feeling exhausted after a long campaign. \"We lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling,\" Clinton wrote. \"Bill took my hand and we just lay there.\"",
    " Title: Taylor Swift Endorses Democratic Candidates in Tennessee Midterm Elections, Potentially Boosting Youth Voter Turnout\n\nArticle:\n\nPop superstar Taylor Swift has announced her political endorsements for the upcoming midterm elections in Tennessee, taking a stance on the candidates running for Senate and House of Representatives. In a post on Instagram, Swift expressed her views on the importance of voting and her support for candidates who align with her values.\n\nSwift, who is 28, wrote, \"I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee.\" She went on to say, \"I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.\"\n\nThe pop megastar announced her support for Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives, stating, \"She did not make it about partisan issues. She made it very much about values, and I think that is an integral part of this election.\"\n\nBlake Kitterman, vice president of Tennessee Young Democrats, told NPR that Swift's endorsement could potentially influence many young voters. \"The basic values that she has as a person, and that I would hope everyone else in the country has, do not really surprise me. It's a clear cut choice between Marsha Blackburn and Phil Bredesen, and I'm happy and reassured that she supported the right candidate in my mind,\" Kitterman said.\n\nSwift's statement comes as she expressed her opposition to Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who is running for the Senate. In her Instagram post, Swift criticized Blackburn's voting record, stating, \"Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.\"\n\nSwift also made it clear that she supports candidates who support LGBTQ rights and gender and racial equality. \"I can not vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender, or who they love,\" she wrote.\n\nAndy Cole, the vice chairman of the Tennessee Young Republicans, expressed doubt that Swift's endorsement would have much influence on young voters. \"We've seen celebrities endorse Democrats before. Most Tennessee voters are worried about which candidate is going to give them a good job, which candidate is going to get out and fix the education system, which candidate is going to do the things Tennessee voters need... We're glad she has an opinion, and we love to see younger people have opinions, because frankly, I think too often, younger people have been disengaged,\" Cole said.\n\nIt remains to be seen to what extent Swift's endorsement could help Democratic candidates. According to a study by Pew, millennials are among the most liberal generations in the U.S., with the majority supporting Democrats in their districts. However, young voters are not showing up at the polls, with only 20 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 24 voting in the past four midterm elections.\n\nIn her post, Swift urged her young fans to show up at the ballot in November. \"Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway... So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count.\"\n\nKitterman of the Tennessee Young Democrats said that even without Swift's support, an increasing number of younger voters will be turning out to vote this year. \"There are multiple threats now going against us, and I think that is a factor in pushing millennial turnout,\" he said. \"Taylor Swift only reinforces this built-up tension that we have in ourselves. Whereas before we thought that we could have no impact, now we have no choice but to exhaust all options to try and make an impact.\"\n\nAccording to The Tennessean and a CBS poll released over the weekend, Blackburn has surged to an eight-point lead over Bredesen.",
    " Title: US-Israeli-Palestinian Tensions Escalate as US Abstains from UN Vote on Israeli Settlements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the United States has abstained from a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlement construction in the occupied territories, leading to a heated response from Israel and a renewed call for a two-state solution by outgoing US Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe resolution, which passed with 14 votes in favor and one abstention (the United States), condemns Israeli settlements as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of a two-state solution. The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious points between Israel and the Palestinians, with more than 500,000 Jews living in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nIn his final address on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Secretary Kerry emphasized the two-state solution as the only viable path to a just and lasting peace. He stated, \"The two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state. That future is now in jeopardy.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Kerry's speech, stating that it was \"unbalanced\" and that Kerry had \"paid lip service to the unremitting Palestinian campaign of terrorism\" against Israel. Netanyahu also criticized Kerry for not acknowledging the Palestinians' refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist.\n\nThe Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Hanan Ashrawi countered Netanyahu's statements, asserting that Palestinians have adhered to past agreements but Israel has not. Ashrawi stated, \"We have accepted the two-state solution and we've acted accordingly and we have honored all our commitments as per the declaration of principles and the agreements.\"\n\nThe UN resolution's passage comes as a new administration prepares to take office in the United States. President-elect Donald Trump has made it clear that he has no plans to push Israel into a corner, tweeting, \"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.\" Trump also stated, \"They used to have a great friend in the US, but... not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (UN)!\"\n\nThe UN resolution's passage and Kerry's final address on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have reignited discussions about the future of diplomacy in the region. France is organizing a peace conference in mid-January, and it has been suggested that decisions taken there could form the basis of another UN resolution before 20 January, when President Obama leaves office. However, Trump's tweets indicate a potential shift in US policy towards Israel.\n\nIn response to the UN resolution, Israel has postponed a vote to authorize construction of almost 500 new homes in Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem. The move apparently follows a request from Netanyahu's office. The UN resolution's passage and the subsequent diplomatic repercussions serve as a reminder of the complex and contentious nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the ongoing efforts to find a peaceful resolution.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Gubernatorial Race: Walker and Burke in a Tight Race as Election Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final week leading up to the Wisconsin gubernatorial election, incumbent Governor Scott Walker and his Democratic opponent, Mary Burke, are in a tight race, with both candidates garnering support from approximately 47 percent of voters, according to Governor Walker himself. The remaining votes are expected to come from \"Obama-Walker voters,\" individuals who may have voted against Walker during his recall election in 2012 but for President Barack Obama in the same year.\n\nWalker, who won the recall election in 2012, has been campaigning on his job creation record, but the issue has become unexpectedly contentious. At campaign stops this week, Walker, who is 46, has been vocal in defending his job creation record, despite coughing and wearing a bandage on one thumb due to a hunting accident. Walker has also expressed his frustration with the national Republican party for not providing enough support for his campaign.\n\nWalker's campaign rhetoric has shifted from the ambitious and dramatic success story he presented in his 2010 race to more bite-sized accomplishments, such as sending a $322 rebate to Wisconsin taxpayers this year. Walker has also emphasized his stance on drug testing for public assistance recipients, which has garnered him support from some voters.\n\nBurke, a wealthy former Trek Bicycle executive and member of the Madison School Board, has been campaigning on her ability to spur economic growth and her practical approach to governance. President Obama campaigned for Burke in Milwaukee on Tuesday evening, praising her as a \"practical person\" who understands that job creation policies should not be judged based on political ideology but rather on their effectiveness.\n\nAs the election day approaches, both candidates are making a final push to win over undecided voters and secure a victory in the traditionally Democratic state. The outcome of the election will determine whether Walker will continue as governor or if Burke will take over as the state's first female governor.",
    " Title: Deadliest U.S. Shooting in Recent History: A Tragic Night in Las Vegas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert has left at least 59 people dead and another 527 injured. The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000.\n\nThe incident occurred during the final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out. The shooting took place late on Sunday night, with the first shots being fired at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday).\n\nPaddock, who booked into the hotel on 28 September, sprayed the site from his high vantage point, causing panic and chaos. Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits, or helping others to escape.\n\nIn an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as \"pure evil.\" He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their \"miraculous\" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn.\n\nInvestigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck.\n\nThe motives behind the attack remain a mystery, with investigators suggesting psychological issues but no confirmation of this. Paddock's brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a \"lone wolf\" attack.\n\nThe investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again.\n\nThe authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack by CBC News. A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim by The Jackson Sun newspaper.\n\nThe shooting has left a profound impact on the city of Las Vegas, with hospitals overwhelmed, not enough ambulances, and a plea for blood donations echoing across the airwaves. The scenes that played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, calls for stricter gun control laws have resurfaced, with former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, calling for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband, Mark Kelly, read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol, saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.",
    " Title: Ian Bremmer Apologizes for Fabricated Quote Attributed to President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump accused journalist and New York University professor Ian Bremmer of fabricating a quote and attributing it to him.\n\n\"@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP'a completely ludicrous quote,' attributing it to me,\" Trump tweeted amid a four-day state visit to Japan. \"This is what's going on in the age of Fake News,\" Trump added. \"People think they can say anything and get away with it.\"\n\nBremmer, in a since-deleted post on Twitter, had quoted Trump as saying \"Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden.\" He also responded to a Twitter user questioning the validity of the quote by saying \"it's plausible\" and in another post said he was commenting on the \"state of media and the twitterverse today.\"\n\nIn another post, he reportedly said his initial tweet included \"a completely ludicrous quote.\"\n\n\"And yet kinda plausible,\" he added. \"Especially on twitter, where people automatically support whatever political position they have. That's the point.\"\n\nMany journalists, including some traveling with Trump in Japan, quickly noted Bremmer's quote was fabricated.\n\nBremmer apologized after Trump's tweet on Monday, saying his initial post was \"meant in jest.\"\n\n\"The President correctly quoted me as saying it was a 'completely ludicrous' statement,\" he added. \"I should have been clearer. My apologies.\"\n\nTrump did write while in Japan that he smiled when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called former Vice President Joe Biden a \"Swampman\" and \"low IQ individual & worse.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has accused a journalist of fabricating a quote. In 2017, he accused CNN of fabricating a quote from him about a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN denied the allegation.",
    " Title: Fact-checking the Town-Hall Debate: A Closer Look at the Candidates' Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nThe town-hall style debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on Tuesday at Hofstra University was a heated exchange, with both candidates under pressure to perform well. This article aims to fact-check the statements made by the candidates during the debate.\n\nObama: \"I said that this was an act of terror.\"\n\nWhile Romney contested that Obama never made this statement, on the day after the Benghazi attack, the president did suggest it was a terrorist strike. However, he did not say outright that the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism.\n\nOn the day after the death of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans, Obama stated, \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\" The ambiguity in this statement has been a point of contention, with Romney and his supporters arguing that the president was speaking broadly and not about the Benghazi attack specifically.\n\nIn the days following the attack, the White House seemed reluctant to call it a terrorist attack. On Sept. 16, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice went on several TV talk shows and declared that the U.S. government's preliminary assessment was that the violence sprang from a \"spontaneous\" demonstration related to an anti-Muslim video.\n\nHowever, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has stated that Rice's account was based on the initial take of U.S. intelligence agencies. They subsequently changed their view and now assess the incident as a pre-planned terrorist attack.\n\nObama: \"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates changes in the Tax Code \u2014 it costs about $ 5 trillion. Gov. Romney then also wants to spend $ 2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military\u2019s not asking for them. That\u2019s $ 7 trillion. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That\u2019s another trillion dollars. That\u2019s $ 8 trillion.\"\n\nObama's math overshot by about $ 1 trillion, by most estimates.\n\nThe president said Romney's budget plan would cost $ 8 trillion \u2014 $ 5 trillion in tax cuts, $ 2 trillion in additional military spending, and $ 1 trillion from the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\n\nRomney's tax plan is estimated to cost $ 5 trillion \u2014 including the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.\n\nRomney says that he would offset the cost of those tax cuts, in part by eliminating or scaling back taxpayer's ability to take credits and deductions. He has not given full details, but again floated the idea of a $ 25,000 cap on deductions, as he did in the first debate. Before that, he had discussed a $ 17,000 cap.",
    " Title: Missouri Gun Measure Fails to Override Veto by One Vote, Sparking Controversy Over State's Claim to Nullify Federal Gun Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a narrow vote, a controversial gun measure in Missouri failed to override the governor's veto by a single vote in the state Senate. The bill, which aimed to thwart any form of federal gun regulation, including background checks, and even criminalize federal agents enforcing these laws, has sparked controversy over the state's claim to nullify federal gun laws.\n\nJohn Donohue, a prominent gun control advocate, called the measure's claim that a state can unilaterally nullify federal law \"absurd.\" He noted that similar attempts to nullify federal gun laws are currently underway in Kansas and Montana, despite the clear language of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that federal laws are the supreme law of the land.\n\nThe failed Missouri bill, if enacted, would have made the state a haven for gun toting felons and the mentally ill. This comes on the heels of the Newtown massacre, which prompted Colorado to adopt a universal background check system and a modest restriction on the size of high-capacity magazines. The measure was met with resistance from gun sellers who do not want the sales to felons and the mentally ill to dry up.\n\nRobert Levy, who led the litigation that argued for a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment, has recently conceded that the Missouri stunt flouts the very Constitution that its supporters claim to uphold. However, his concessions have fallen on deaf ears in the legislatures of Kansas and Montana, where the idea of state nullification of federal gun laws seems eminently reasonable.\n\nThe failed Missouri bill is a reminder of the heated gun control debate in the U.S., with some states moving towards more stringent gun control measures, while others are relaxing their gun laws. The damage will be slight in states like Iowa, which recently offered concealed carry permits to blind individuals, as most blind Iowans will have the good sense not to possess or discharge firearms.\n\nHowever, the overheated rhetoric flowing from the NRA crowd during the Colorado recall and from Missouri (and similarly inclined states) is dangerous for at least two reasons. First, it undermines our democracy when voters act based on false and misleading views about the actual content of state and federal laws. Second, similar hyperbolic rhetoric after the passage of the federal background check system and the (now elapsed) federal assault weapons ban galvanized the unstable gun zealot Timothy McVeigh forward with his scheme to blow up the federal building in Oklahoma City.\n\nAs the gun control debate continues, law-abiding citizens with guns have to recognize their obligations to prevent the types of tragedies that occur on a daily basis in the U.S. when lawfully owned guns are used, intentionally or inadvertently, to kill and maim others. One needs to accommodate the interests of legitimate gun owners if sensible gun laws are to be passed, but gun owners must also take responsibility - first, by not being duped by NRA deceptions to advance the economic interests of gun merchants, and second, by taking every effort to ensure that their guns do not contribute to the mayhem.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Decision to Prosecute Osama bin Laden's Son-in-law in Civilian Court Sparks Congressional Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to try Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, in a federal court in New York City instead of a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has reignited a debate over how to deal with suspected terrorists. The trial, which took place today, has brought back memories of President Obama's unfulfilled promise as a candidate in 2008 to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAs Abu Ghaith pleaded not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans in New York Federal Court, Republicans in Congress were criticizing the Obama administration for prosecuting a suspected al Qaeda terrorist in a civilian court, just about a mile from the 9/11 memorial built over Ground Zero.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote in a statement, \"Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies. He is an enemy combatant and should be held in military custody.\"\n\nThe White House claimed there was a \"broad consensus\" across the federal government, from the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security, to prosecute OBL's son-in-law in civilian court.\n\n\"The intelligence community agrees that the best way to protect our national security interests is to prosecute Abu Ghaith in an Article III court,\" Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today. \"We're able to question him as a part of the regular process in detaining individuals like this, but we're also able to put him through Article III courts to ensure that he's held accountable for his crimes.\"\n\nHowever, McConnell said the administration's justification \"makes little sense\" and the intelligence community \"deserve the same access to intelligence and methods of defeating the enemy available to the team that found Bin Laden.\"\n\n\"At Guantanamo, [Abu Ghaith] could be held as a detainee and fully and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers,\" McConnell said.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said civilian court \"is not the appropriate venue\" and the administration \"should treat enemy combatants like the enemy.\"\n\n\"Al Qaeda leaders captured on the battlefield should not be brought to the United States to stand trial,\" Rogers said. \"The president needs to send any captured al Qaeda members to Guantanamo.\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, who opposes closing Guantanamo and previously fought against efforts by the Obama administration to prosecute 9/11 suspects in New York City, said the speaker \"agrees\" with Rogers.\n\nNew York Republican Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., said he preferred that Abu Ghaith face trial in a military tribunal rather than civilian court, and he questioned what type of standard today's hearing could set.\n\n\"While a federal court trial of Abu Ghaith in lower Manhattan would not present the same security issues as a trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, I strongly believe as a matter of policy that military tribunals are the proper venue for enemy combatants,\" said King, a member of the House committees on Intelligence and Homeland Security. \"If the Abu Ghaith trial does go forward in federal court, it must not be used as a precedent for future enemy combatants who should be tried at Guantanamo.\"\n\nHowever, not all members of Congress oppose the administration's actions. New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who represents the congressional district where Ground Zero is located in lower Manhattan, said he is \"pleased Sulaiman Abu Ghaith will have to face justice in New York.\"\n\n\"I have long urged that we try terrorists in our civilian courts under the laws of the United States. We have done so successfully in the past, and we must continue to do so,\" Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"We are a nation committed to the rule of law, and we will demonstrate our values to the world even in the face of the most despicable mass murder in our history.\"",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Proposal for Border Control Strategy in Immigration Reform Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing negotiations within the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan coalition working on the U.S. immigration reform bill, are facing a significant challenge as the Republican Party pushes for a stricter border security policy. This development is testing the limits of the coalition and could potentially alter the course of the bill's progress through Congress.\n\nThe Senate negotiators aim to secure as many as two dozen Republican votes to demonstrate a strong bipartisan support that would compel the House to act. However, the revised bill needs to be more stringent to stand a chance of passing in the House. The challenge lies in maintaining the support of the vast majority of Senate Democrats who favor the current bill while tightening the border security measures.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a key member of the Gang of Eight, is advocating for Congress, rather than the Department of Homeland Security, to draft the border control strategy. This strategy would be a prerequisite for most of the other elements of reform. Rubio argues that Americans do not trust the government to get it right, and he wants lawmakers to craft the plan at the outset, rather than leaving the details to the Obama administration.\n\nReform proponents are concerned that the Senate supermajority might be an elusive goal, potentially undermining the bill, particularly on border security. Marshall Fitz, a veteran of the 2006 and 2007 reform fights, expressed this concern, stating, \"We are advocating for a strong and tight and effective a bill as possible. If that means we are targeting 62 votes, then 62 on a strong bill is better than 75 on a weak bill that looks like a special interest bonanza.\"\n\nRubio has expressed doubts about the current version of the legislation's ability to garner enough votes to break a filibuster, let alone the 70-plus votes that Gang of Eight leaders want. He believes that the border security requirements must be tightened before Republicans can consider backing the bill.\n\nRubio has been influential in the Gang of Eight deliberations, securing concessions that align with his preferences, such as a cut-off date for legalization, an extended debate in the Judiciary Committee, and a fix for a stronger system for tracking visa holders. He is currently reaching out to key Republican senators and undecided Democrats to gauge their demands for the bill.\n\nIn his efforts to secure support for his proposal, Rubio has invoked the IRS scandal, arguing that the government's handling of sensitive information warrants a more stringent border control strategy. The outcome of these negotiations will significantly impact the future of the immigration reform bill.",
    " Title: \"Wage Gap in U.S. Recovery from Great Recession Raises Concerns over Income Inequality\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent White House news conference, President Obama stated that the American economy is in a better state, with the country having regained all the jobs lost during the Great Recession. However, a new report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Mayors has cast doubt on the strength of the American economy, revealing a significant wage gap in the sectors where jobs were lost and restored.\n\nThe report, prepared by the firm IHS, shows that the annual wage in sectors where jobs were lost was $61,637, while the annual wage in sectors where jobs were restored was only $47,171 - a net loss estimated at $93 billion and representing a \"wage gap\" of 23 percent. This wage gap is a stark contrast to the recovery from the 2001-2002 recession, where the \"wage gap\" experienced was only 12 percent.\n\nThe findings of the report have raised questions about the quality of jobs being created in America, with economists questioning whether these jobs are well-paying enough to support the families and households dependent on them. Pamela Villareal, a Dallas-based economist with the National Center for Policy Analysis, stated, \"What we really need is more growth in the higher-paying high-tech jobs, and that could be accomplished by reducing some of the regulations and some of the taxes that are discouraging job growth here in the United States.\"\n\nAnother finding of the IHS report, validating earlier studies, shows that income inequality - defined as the unequal distribution of income across the various participants in the economy - has grown during the recovery from the Great Recession. The top 20 percent of income-earning households in 1975 took home 43.6 percent of all income earned in the United States, the study finds, while that same top quintile of households now takes home 51 percent of all income.\n\nEconomist Jim Diffley, of IHS, noted that the trend of the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer extends back decades. He stated, \"There's no particular policies of this administration that drove that change that we can identify. It tells you about the structure of the economy as it's evolved over time, over a much longer time than, than Barack Obama has been president.\" Diffley added, \"I often say about presidents and governors that they get too much credit when the economy is good and too much blame when the economy is bad.\"",
    " Title: Judge Rules Paul Manafort Breached Plea Deal, Lied to Prosecutors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson has ruled that Paul Manafort, former campaign chief for President Donald Trump, breached his plea deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller by lying to prosecutors and a grand jury.\n\nAccording to the ruling, Manafort, who is currently detained in a Virginia detention center since June, made multiple false statements to the FBI, Mr. Mueller's office, and a grand jury. The judge's ruling was made on Wednesday.\n\nThe ruling indicates that Manafort, 69, lied about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant who is believed to have ties with Russian intelligence. However, the judge cleared Manafort of allegations that he lied on two other subjects.\n\nManafort had initially pleaded guilty to some charges, avoiding a separate trial. He was convicted of financial fraud in August, relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for cooperating with Mr. Mueller's investigation.\n\nLast year, Mr. Mueller stated that Manafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" after signing the plea deal. In August, Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prison and would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts. However, deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed.\n\nThis ruling marks the first criminal trial arising from the Department of Justice's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. However, the charges against Manafort relate only to his political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely predating his role with the Trump campaign.\n\nManafort worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when President Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. President Trump has consistently branded the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt\" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia.\n\nManafort was charged by Mr. Mueller last October and during the trial, he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud.",
    " Title: President Obama Outlines Steps to Address VA Scandal, Stops Short of Firing Secretary Shinseki\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a long-awaited address on Wednesday, President Barack Obama outlined steps to address the ongoing Veterans Affairs (VA) scandal, while stopping short of calling for the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki. The president described Shinseki as a \"great soldier\" who has \"put his heart and soul into this thing.\"\n\nObama has dispatched White House deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to oversee a broader review of the VA. Nabors was sent to Phoenix, where allegations of patient deaths tied to delayed care first surfaced. The president acknowledged the need for improvement, stating, \"We've got to do better.\"\n\nHowever, Obama indicated he would wait for the conclusion of internal investigations before determining whether more top officials should resign. He emphasized, \"If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it -- period.\"\n\nLeading Republicans swiftly criticized the president's remarks, with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell stating, \"It's time for serious action and accountability.\" Sen. John McCain, a veteran and former prisoner of war, called Obama's statements \"wholly insufficient in addressing the fundamental, systemic problems plaguing our veterans' health care system.\"\n\nThe controversy has expanded, with the Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General's Office investigating 26 facilities nationwide over allegations of manipulated waiting times and other issues. The House of Representatives has also passed a bill that would give the VA secretary greater authority to fire or demote senior executives.\n\nThe VA scandal erupted in Phoenix last month, with allegations of delayed care that may have led to patient deaths and a cover-up by top administrators. The current director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System, Sharon Helman, has been placed on leave indefinitely while the VA's inspector general investigates the claims.\n\nTwo Republican senators have introduced legislation to prohibit payment of bonuses to employees at the Veterans Health Administration through next year. Meanwhile, the House passed a bill in February that would eliminate performance bonuses for the department's senior executive staff through 2018.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, has also called on Obama to reconsider his plan to nominate Jeffrey Murawsky to replace the VA's undersecretary for health care, Robert Petzel, who has stepped down. Murawsky, a career VA administrator, directly supervised Helman from 2010 to 2012.\n\nThe White House has maintained its support for Shinseki and Murawsky's nomination. The VA scandal continues to unfold, with further investigations and legislative action expected in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: An Unbiased Look at Chief Justice John Roberts' Voting Record: A Review of His Conservative Tendencies\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court's new term commences on Monday, the court's conservative majority, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, is poised to make significant decisions on issues such as gun control, abortion, L.G.B.T. rights, and immigration. The term could potentially signal the extent to which the court's conservative majority will obstruct the agenda of the next Democratic president and Congress.\n\nWhile Democrats may hold a positive view of Chief Justice Roberts, who has expressed respect for precedent and concern for the court's legitimacy, history suggests that they have much to fear. The chief justice is not a swing vote among his four liberal and four conservative justices, nor a moderate. Instead, he tends to align with the conservative justices.\n\nDuring his 2005 confirmation hearing, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized his \"respect for precedent, even-handedness, predictability, stability.\" However, his voting record, analyzed over the last 14 years, reveals a partisan tilt. He has voted to overturn precedent in 81% of the cases where he was a part of a precedent-overturning majority, second only to Justice Clarence Thomas. In cases with partisan implications, he has voted for conservative outcomes 93% of the time.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by Take Back the Court, relies on the methodology used by the Supreme Court Database, maintained by the law school at Washington University in St. Louis. The organization determined whether a decision was liberal or conservative based on the voting patterns of at least four liberal or four conservative justices in split rulings.\n\nThe chief justice's voting record is as conservative as those of his most extreme current and former colleagues\u2014Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Antonin Scalia. In all 42 split-decision cases that the chief justice has presided over involving racial minorities, immigrants, workers, and abortion, he has voted for conservative outcomes 100% of the time. This trend raises concerns about the potential impact of his decisions on these and other contentious issues.",
    " Title: California Joins Oregon in Automatic Voter Registration, Aiming to Increase Voter Participation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards increasing voter participation, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill on Saturday that will automatically register eligible citizens to vote. The new law, which takes effect in 2016, will see adult citizens who obtain a driver's license, renew a license, get a state identification card, or fill out a change of address form with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) automatically registered to vote, unless they decline the registration.\n\nOregon, which became the first state in the country to implement automatic voter registration earlier this year, now has a companion in California. North Dakota is the only US state with no voter registration system at all.\n\nThe new California law follows federal laws that allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. However, California and Oregon's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.\n\nHistorically, governments in the United States have often erected barriers to voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests. Over time, many of these barriers have been dismantled to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election, an artificial obstacle that can prevent eligible voters from participating if they miss the deadline.\n\nThese new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses.\n\nThe new California law has sparked debate, with support and opposition breaking down along party lines. Democrats in California's legislature overwhelmingly supported the bill, but Republicans overwhelmingly opposed it, with several citing concerns about potential voter fraud. About one-fifth of the state's 38 million people are eligible to vote, but not registered, according to the Los Angeles Times's Patrick McGreevy.\n\nPrivacy concerns and voter fraud are the two main criticisms leveled against the new law. Critics argue that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.\n\nSome Republicans have also expressed concerns about voter fraud, particularly regarding the potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. However, California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, and these licenses are distinctively marked. People with them would not be registered to vote automatically. Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.\n\nNational Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law, with the Brennan Center tracking them.",
    " Title: Warren Proposes $20 Trillion Medicare for All Plan, Faces Skepticism from Rivals and Experts\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on Friday unveiled a detailed plan to provide health care to every American without raising taxes on the middle class, a move that aims to address criticism of her previous lack of clarity on how she would fund her Medicare for All proposal. The Massachusetts senator's plan, however, has faced immediate pushback from her moderate rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who questioned the plan's feasibility and cost.\n\nWarren's proposal, outlined in a 20-page online post, suggests that employers transfer to the government almost all the $8.8 trillion the senator estimates they would otherwise spend on private insurance for employees. The plan aims to generate nearly half of the required funds for Medicare for All by asking employers to pay slightly less than what they are projected to pay today, and through existing taxes.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Warren said her plan was drafted with the help of top health care experts and economists. \"If Joe Biden doesn't like that... I'm just not sure where he's going,\" she said. Companies with fewer than 50 employees that don't already sponsor coverage would be exempt from the proposal, and employers offering health benefits under collective bargaining agreements will be allowed to reduce their contributions to federal coffers, provided they pass the savings on to employees.\n\nDemocrats have long debated the role of government in health care, and the issue's complex politics resurfaced after Warren released her proposal. Biden, who favors building on the Affordable Care Act, criticized Warren's plan as eliminating private insurance coverage and said it still amounts to a tax increase on workers. President Donald Trump has branded Medicare for All as socialism.\n\nWarren's chief rival, Bernie Sanders, has previously released several options to pay for Medicare for All, including a 4% income tax \"premium\" that kicks in after the first $29,000 for a family of four, affecting the middle class. Some independent experts have raised doubts about the Warren campaign's estimates, with John Holahan, an economist at the Urban Institute, stating that they are making more aggressive assumptions about the same things the institute already made aggressive assumptions about.\n\nThe task of passing such legislation through Congress also presents challenges. A Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to approve anything approaching Medicare for All, and if Democrats took the Senate majority, the party almost surely won't have enough votes to break a filibuster. The accuracy of Warren's $20 trillion cost estimate is a critical question, as the Urban Institute think tank recently pegged the cost closer to $34 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe real-world application of Warren's proposed employer contribution will be closely scrutinized, as it could create winners and losers among companies depending on their health care costs, which can reflect such factors as the age of the workforce and the generosity of benefits. The plan's revenue estimates could also face political hurdles, with many lawmakers likely to be reluctant to side with Warren's call to raise $800 billion over 10 years by eliminating a Pentagon contingency fund used for anti-terrorism operations, among other contentious proposals.\n\nOver the weekend, Warren and more than a dozen other candidates will be in Iowa, which holds the nation's leadoff presidential caucuses in three months. Health care remains a dominant issue as the first votes of the Democratic contest near.",
    " Title: Schumer Advocates for Open Primaries as a Strategy to Counteract the Tea Party Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Center for American Progress on Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, proposed a plan to counteract the Tea Party movement by advocating for more open primaries. The plan aims to weaken the grass-roots conservative movement that has been a significant obstacle to President Obama's agenda over the past three years.\n\nSchumer suggested implementing a nonpartisan \"blanket\" primary system, where all candidates compete, and the top finishers advance regardless of party affiliation. This system, he argued, would force right-wing candidates to appeal to centrist voters, thereby pushing out the most extreme candidates.\n\nCurrently, such a system is in place in California, Louisiana, and Washington state. Schumer believes that the Tea Party movement is being influenced by a few wealthy donors whose limited-government philosophy does not reflect the ideas of millions of voters who identify as Tea Party supporters but who benefit from government programs such as Social Security or public education.\n\nSchumer argued that the best way to address the Tea Party's \"obsessive, anti-government mania\" is to confront it directly by demonstrating the need for government to help people out of their current predicament. He suggested that Democrats should focus on issues such as raising the minimum wage, making college more affordable, and building bridges, roads, and broadband infrastructure.\n\nSal Russo, the chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, predicted that this strategy would not resonate with Tea Party supporters. \"The tea party is not going to be assuaged by suggesting that even a bigger and more expensive federal government is the answer,\" Russo said.\n\nThe Tea Party movement emerged in 2009 in response to the government bailout of private banks and President Obama's early moves to increase government spending. Powered by Tea Party enthusiasm, insurgent candidates unseated longtime Republicans in primaries in 2010, contributing to the Republicans' takeover of the House and gains in the Senate. However, several Tea Party Senate candidates lost races that analysts had predicted could have been won by more mainstream candidates.\n\nDan Holler, communications director for the conservative activist group Heritage Action for America, commented that Schumer's hour-long speech indicates that Democrats are starting to view Tea Party lawmakers as serious competition. Holler suggested that Schumer's strategy is aimed at dividing the Tea Party.\n\nSchumer also expressed concern about signs of xenophobia or cultural fear among Tea Party supporters, suggesting that they worry about increased immigration or a more diverse political landscape. He compared the Tea Party's limited-government message to Prohibition in the 1920s, describing it as a reaction to the country's shift to a more urban economy.",
    " Title: U.S. Aid Delivery Freeze for Coronavirus-Related PPE Aid to 13 Countries Puts Strain on Allies and International Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe delivery of coronavirus-related Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) aid to at least 13 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Honduras, and the Philippines, has been put on hold due to a review process, according to an administration official. This has left American officials uncertain about how to explain the delay to foreign counterparts. The potential consequence of this delay, officials acknowledge, is the risk of damaging relationships with allies who could be crucial in providing critical supplies in the future.\n\nThe U.S. task force is reportedly discussing the potential role of foreign aid in assisting the U.S. during a second wave of the virus, either in the fall or later this summer. Vice President Mike Pence is said to be aware of the need to time the provision of assistance appropriately, while also recognizing the value of foreign aid in supporting the U.S. during the pandemic.\n\nAmerican diplomats are also grappling with China's attempts to exploit the global shortage of medical supplies by supplying aid to Western countries. This is particularly concerning given China's interest in demonstrating its global leadership.\n\nIn the last two months, at least five U.S. embassies, including in Myanmar, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Laos, have announced the donation of protective gear to their host countries. U.S. embassies in Kazakhstan, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mongolia, Nepal, and Pakistan have also announced support for fighting coronavirus.\n\nThere is bipartisan agreement on the need to resupply American hospitals and address domestic shortages first. However, the slow and insufficient international aid is seen as a risk for the continued spread of the virus to Americans and communities in countries with weaker infrastructure, immense poverty, and ongoing humanitarian crises.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy, expressed concern about the slow and insufficient international aid. Other Democrats have been more critical, with Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House adviser for President Barack Obama, suggesting that sending two million masks to China weeks before the coronavirus reached the U.S. could be a damaging political ad.\n\nThe U.S. government has not yet curbed exports by U.S. companies, with roughly 280 million masks being purchased by foreign buyers on Monday alone, according to Forbes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not actively encouraged or discouraged U.S. companies from exporting overseas, but is asking the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to send back most of the reserves of protective gear it has stored in warehouses in Dubai and Miami for use in the U.S.\n\nA senior State Department official emphasized that the U.S. government is not providing countries with hard-to-find equipment that could be used to fight coronavirus in the United States instead. The official added that the hold is not intended to be permanent, and that aid will be shifted to other countries when industries are able to ramp up production and the U.S. has enough capacity.",
    " Title: U.S. Healthcare System Capable of Containing Ebola Outbreak, Says Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is working to alleviate concerns about the Ebola virus in the United States, asserting that the healthcare system is adequately prepared to prevent an outbreak. In a high-level briefing at the White House on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, stated, \"Our healthcare infrastructure in the United States is well-equipped to stop Ebola in its tracks.\"\n\nFive senior administration officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's top homeland security adviser, addressed reporters during the briefing. Monaco emphasized that the U.S. is not considering a travel ban to prevent individuals from the hardest-hit West African countries from entering the U.S. Instead, efforts are focused on identifying high-risk individuals before they leave the outbreak zone.\n\nDozens of people have been stopped from boarding flights in the affected region, Monaco said. The first case of Ebola in the U.S. was diagnosed last week, and the patient was initially sent home from a Dallas hospital despite revealing a visit from Liberia. Texas officials are now monitoring 50 people, 10 of whom are considered at high risk, who came into contact with the patient. Four of these individuals have been quarantined, and there have been issues with disposing of the infectious waste left in the patient's apartment.\n\nDr. Fauci acknowledged that there were mistakes in the handling of the Dallas case, stating, \"There were things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas.\" However, he emphasized that many things are being done correctly.\n\nHealth officials have stated that it is possible that someone who had close contact with the initial patient after they became ill\u2014the only time Ebola is contagious\u2014might also contract the virus. However, they believe further spread is unlikely due to the public health measures now in place.\n\nFauci reassured, \"We respect your concern. We understand your concern. But the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen.\"\n\nThe White House announced that Obama will meet with his national security advisers on Monday to discuss the Ebola outbreak and the administration's response. The administration has long maintained that the best strategy to contain Ebola is to address it at its source. The Pentagon's spokesman reported that up to 4,000 troops could be deployed to West Africa, a number that has been gradually increasing as military leaders assess the need.\n\nNavy Rear Adm. John Kirby stated that the military has begun medical testing for Ebola at two new labs in Liberia. Service members are also constructing two treatment centers for Ebola victims and a hospital for infected medical personnel, with the latter expected to be completed by the end of October.\n\nKirby clarified that service members will not treat patients or come into contact with infected individuals. However, they are being trained on how to avoid contracting Ebola and have plans in place to deal with any service member who might become infected.\n\nApproximately 230 U.S. troops are currently deployed for the Ebola mission. About two dozen are in Senegal setting up a transportation center, with the rest in Liberia. The Army has announced that up to 3,200 soldiers from various units across the U.S. will be deployed to Liberia, including 1,800 from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who will arrive later this month. Other troops from Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are also being deployed, along with support units from Fort Benning and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and Fort Eustis, Virginia.",
    " Title: Clinton Narrows Vice Presidential Search, Tim Kaine and Tom Vilsack Emerging as Leading Contenders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move, Hillary Clinton is set to announce her vice presidential running mate this Friday, with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack emerging as leading contenders, according to sources close to the campaign. The announcement will be made in Miami, where Clinton is planning to make her first appearance with her running mate at a campaign rally on Saturday.\n\nClinton's choice of the battleground state of Florida for her public announcement is a strategic move to seize the spotlight from the Republicans after their convention in Cleveland. She is scheduled to visit Orlando and Tampa on Friday, but her new partner is not expected to join her until Saturday at a rally at Florida International University, where the student body is more than half Hispanic.\n\nSen. Kaine, who speaks fluent Spanish, has received strong backing from President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. Last week, Clinton beamed at a Virginia rally as Kaine declared, \"Estamos listos para Hillary!\" or \"We are ready for Hillary!\"\n\nClinton has yet to reveal her choice beyond her tight inner circle, fearful of it leaking before a well-orchestrated weekend rollout. Her campaign has offered supporters the chance to be the \"first to know\" her vice presidential pick, similar to what Barack Obama did in 2008.\n\nThe focus of her search in the final days also centers on Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, according to several Democrats close to the process. Both Kaine and Vilsack are seen as strong governing partners and ready for the presidency, meeting Clinton's chief criteria.\n\nThe selection of a running mate opens a new and important chapter in Clinton's political life. She was deeply involved in the selection of Al Gore to be her husband's running mate in 1992, but this choice is hers. Her husband favors Kaine, people close to him say, but one added this week: \"He gets a say, but does not have a vote on this.\"\n\nThe weekend debut of the Democratic ticket is designed to build anticipation for the party's convention starting Monday in Philadelphia. After they are formally nominated, Clinton and her new running mate are expected to embark on a bus tour to key campaign battlegrounds, similar to the \"First 1,000 Miles\" caravan in 1992 that took the Clintons and Gores to eight states on their way to winning the White House in November.",
    " Title: Activist and Daughter of Eric Garner, Erica Garner, Passes Away at 27\n\nArticle:\n\nErica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, has passed away at the age of 27. Garner, who became an outspoken critic of police brutality following her father's death in 2014, died on Saturday in a New York hospital after being in a coma following a massive heart attack.\n\nGarner's last words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for activists after her father's death on Staten Island, New York, in 2014, as police were trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling single cigarettes without tax stamps. A grand jury declined to indict the officer involved in the incident, and the city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement.\n\nGarner had been in a coma since suffering cardiac arrest on Christmas Eve. Her mother, Esaw Snipes-Garner, said her daughter suffered her first heart attack not long after giving birth in August.\n\nIn a statement on her official Twitter account, which was run by her family and friends after her illness, her heart was described as \"bigger than the world.\" \"She cared when most people would not have. She was good. She only pursued right, no matter what. No one gave her justice,\" the statement read.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the activist endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, for president in the Democratic primaries and appeared in a campaign ad on his behalf. She also criticized New York City's Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio over policing matters.\n\nShortly after Erica was hospitalized, Sanders issued a statement on Twitter regarding her activism. \"My thoughts are with Erica Garner,\" he said. \"I have had the privilege of joining with her at a number of events and was deeply impressed with her courage and insights.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, in announcing Garner's death on Saturday, said she was \"a warrior to the end.\" He added, \"Her heart was bigger than the world. It really really was.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Fourth of July Speech: A Review of Claims and Facts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his Fourth of July speech, President Donald Trump reflected on the nation's history and its accomplishments, but also made several claims about the coronavirus and his administration's response to the pandemic that have been deemed misleading or false by experts.\n\nAccording to Trump, his administration's strategy to address coronavirus \"is moving along well.\" He added, \"We've learned how to put out the flame.\" However, it's misleading for the President to claim the US has \"learned how to put out the flame\" of coronavirus when the country has experienced its highest daily rate of cases over the past week.\n\nIn the days leading up to Trump's remarks, the US set a new global record for the most number of coronavirus cases recorded in a day. And the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testified last week that at least 12 states reported an increase in daily hospitalizations for coronavirus patients.\n\nTo be fair, Trump did acknowledge that the virus is still a problem, saying, \"It goes out in one area, it rears back its ugly face in another area.\" But still, to claim that the US response to the pandemic is \"moving along well\" is disingenuous, and ignores not just the current situation in the US, but also how it compares to other countries.\n\nThe US response to coronavirus is also not \"moving along well\" when compared with other countries. While coronavirus cases remain high in the US, other countries in Europe and across the world have seen clear downward trends in the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases. The European Union has also banned US residents from traveling there given the sudden spike in coronavirus cases in the US.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday evening, Trump falsely suggested, not for the first time, that the recent rise in US coronavirus cases is due to increased testing, and claimed that a majority of the cases that test positive for coronavirus are \"totally harmless.\"\n\n\"Now we have tested, almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases -- 99% of which are totally harmless -- results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: While higher case numbers can sometimes be attributed to better testing, experts say the recent surges in coronavirus cases are outpacing the increase in tests. Even officials from Trump's own government have testified to that fact. Last week, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services, told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, \"There is no question that the more testing you get, the more you will uncover -- but we do believe this is a real increase in cases, because the percent positivity's are going up. So, this is real increases in cases.\"\n\nFurthermore, it is unclear how the President could be under the impression that 99% of US coronavirus cases are \"totally harmless.\" Out of the at least 2.8 million cases of coronavirus in the US, Johns Hopkins estimated a fatality rate of 4.6% as of Saturday. The US death toll from coronavirus is also more than twice as high as that of the country with the second-highest death rate, Brazil, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization has said the global fatality rate is likely less than 1%, the WHO also said about 20% of all people who are diagnosed with coronavirus are sick enough to need oxygen or hospital care.\n\nThe commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday declined to defend the President and repeatedly refused to say whether Trump's remark is true or false.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,\" Dr. Stephen Hahn, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThe White House has not returned CNN's request for comment on the President's claim.\n\nContinuing to frame his initiatives as successful, the President said, \"We are unleashing our nation's scientific brilliance. And we'll likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year.\"\n\nFacts First: Trump's timeline is more optimistic than both experts' and his own previous predictions. Last week, some top health officials said the US could be on track to have a vaccine by the end of the year, but not \"long before.\" While several vaccine candidates have shown positive early data, all of them still have to undergo more trials.\n\nTrump touted efforts led by his administration to manufacture the equipment needed to fight the outbreak. He claimed, \"We've made ventilators where there were none.\" However, it's not true that the Trump administration was left no ventilators by the Obama administration, something Trump has falsely claimed on numerous occasions. In March, there were 16,660 ventilators available in the national stockpile for immediate use, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
    " Title: Health Care Ruling to Influence Swing District Races: Maffei and Buerkle's Rematch in Upstate New York\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the closely divided, upstate New York swing district, the rematch between former Democratic Representative Dan Maffei and incumbent Republican Ann Marie Buerkle is set to be a heated contest. The health care debate, sparked by the recent Supreme Court ruling, is expected to play a significant role in the election.\n\nMaffei, who lost his seat in 2010 due to his support for the health care bill, is advocating for a shift in focus towards economic improvement. He believes the health care bill is now the law of the land, having been ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, and suggests improvements rather than revisiting past debates.\n\nBuerkle, who won in 2010 by a narrow margin, is a staunch opponent of the health care law and is committed to its repeal. She has been vocal about her stance, speaking out alongside Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor following the Supreme Court ruling, and delivering the national Republican address on the topic over the weekend.\n\nThe health care debate is likely to be a key factor in swing districts across the country, particularly in regions still grappling with the effects of the recession. Independent voters, who are crucial in these districts, are likely to be influenced by the debate's outcome.\n\nRetired Fair Haven resident Harris Brown, who leans towards Buerkle but desires less partisanship in Washington, emphasizes the need for economic growth to improve health care. \"If the economy is good, then health care will take care of itself,\" Brown said.\n\nBuerkle, who represents a relatively moderate district and is one of the most conservative members of the House, has embraced her role as a freshman warrior, continuing to speak out on the health care law at the national level. She links the repeal of the health care law to the economic recovery the area needs, citing examples such as a local medical device factory that could be subject to a 2.3 percent tax should the law fully take effect.\n\nThe health care debate's impact on the election in this district could serve as a national barometer for how health care plays out in other swing districts. The outcome may hinge on each candidate's ability to persuade voters on the merits of their respective positions.",
    " Title: Trump and Omar Exchange Harsh Words as Political Rivalry Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a continuation of the ongoing political feud, President Donald Trump and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) exchanged harsh rhetoric on Tuesday, with the conflict showing no signs of abating. The latest exchange came in the form of a presidential tweet labeling Omar as \"America-hating\" and an \"Anti-Semite.\"\n\nOmar responded, stating, \"Right now, even when we are talking about the president, people will say, 'You know, his remarks are racist,' and we'll forget the inherent racism that has always been part of him.\"\n\nIn another tweet on Tuesday, Trump referred to Omar and her liberal freshman \"squad\" members as a \"Nightmare for America.\" CBS News Political Director Caitlin Conant noted during her appearance on \u2588\u2588\u2588's 'Faith Nation' that Trump has transformed the \"squad's\" perceived anti-American views into a significant talking point for the 2020 race.\n\nHowever, the strategy may not guarantee a second term for Trump, as some believe that independents would rather discuss economic and judicial issues rather than the ongoing Twitter spat between the President and the \"squad.\"\n\nConservative groups have seized upon comments made by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) a few months ago, in which she stated, \"I'm more Palestinian in the halls of Congress than I am in the country.\" This statement has become a point of contention, with some viewing it as an expression of allegiance to a foreign nation.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Omar is not limited to her comments about white men and the \"squad.\" She is also the focus of an ethics complaint filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, alleging that Omar may have married her biological brother and committed perjury, immigration fraud, and marriage fraud.\n\nAs this political food fight continues, it is worth noting that the president's approval rating is significantly higher than any of the \"squad\" members, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) garnering the highest approval rating at 23 percent. The ongoing feud between Trump and the \"squad\" is likely to remain a significant part of the political landscape in the lead-up to the 2020 election.",
    " Title: Retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn Killed During Riots, Tributes Pour In\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, retired St. Louis police captain David Dorn was killed during a violent riot that erupted in the city on Monday night. The 77-year-old was attempting to protect a friend's pawn shop when he was fatally shot by looters who broke into Lee's Pawn & Jewelry.\n\nAccording to reports, Dorn's body was discovered outside the pawn shop around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday. The Associated Press reported that no arrests have been made in connection with the case so far.\n\nDorn was a close friend of the pawn shop's owner and often assisted him whenever the store's alarms went off. His wife, St. Louis police sergeant Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Dispatch that Dorn regularly came to the owner's aid.\n\nDorn's death occurred amidst the nationwide unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25. Officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with Floyd's death, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe.\n\nDorn, who retired from the St. Louis police force in October 2007 after serving 38 years, was well-respected in the law enforcement community. St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch, who knew Dorn for 30 years, told the media that Dorn and his wife were dedicated to helping disadvantaged youth during his time on the force.\n\n\"He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,\" said Fitch, who led a similar program at the county level. \"He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump paid tribute to Dorn in a tweet on Tuesday, saying, \"Our highest respect to the family of David Dorn, a Great Police Captain from St. Louis, who was viciously shot and killed by despicable looters last night. We honor our police officers, perhaps more than ever before. Thank you!\"\n\nDorn's death is one of several incidents involving police officers who have been killed or attacked during the riots. Four officers in Missouri were shot while trying to contain rioters. A police officer in Las Vegas was in \"grave condition\" and on life support after being shot. An officer was also shot in Iowa after an ambush. Two officers in Richmond, Virginia, were shot after responding to a report of an armed person, though it is still unclear if the person was involved with the riots.\n\nIn other incidents, two officers in Buffalo, New York, were injured after an SUV ran into a line of police trying to maintain the peace. Another officer was run over by a speeding vehicle in the Bronx.\n\nDorn's death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from law enforcement agencies and politicians across the country. The St. Louis Police Officers Association said in a statement, \"Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of a true hero, a friend, and a mentor to many.\"\n\nDorn's death serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that law enforcement officers face in the line of duty. He will be remembered for his dedication to his community and his commitment to helping those in need.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina's Business Acumen and Political Stance Face Scrutiny in GOP Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nCarly Fiorina, the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, is making waves in the Republican presidential race as the sole female contender in a field dominated by men. With Hillary Clinton, a potential Democratic opponent, looming on the horizon, Fiorina's business experience and acumen are her main claims to the national stage.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News, Fiorina emphasized her understanding of the economy, the world, and big bureaucracies as key assets. However, questions have been raised about her ability to persuade voters that she still embodies the business community she touts as her greatest asset.\n\nFiorina's tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard, which ended in 2005, has been a subject of debate. While her $25 billion takeover of Compaq in 2001 is often cited as a significant achievement, her leadership has also been criticized for leaving the company in a worse state than when she took over.\n\nA more significant challenge for Fiorina may be her stance on economic and social issues compared to her corporate peers. While she aligns with the GOP on critical primary issues like minimum wage increases, immigration reform, and same-sex marriage, she is increasingly out-of-step with her corporate brethren.\n\nThe recent controversy over religious freedom laws in several states, such as Indiana and Arkansas, has highlighted this divide. Fiorina, who had previously taken a more nuanced view on same-sex marriage, found herself in conflict with her former business colleagues over the issue.\n\nThe corporate world's stance on social issues has shifted significantly since Fiorina last led a company. CEOs of major corporations, including Apple, McDonald's, and Walmart, have voiced support for minimum wage increases, a position that contrasts with Fiorina's and most GOP candidates'. Similarly, CEOs are calling for immigration reform and criticizing efforts to block it, as well as blaming opposition by Republican party leaders for the 2013 government shutdown crisis.\n\nLong-time denizens of the corporate boardroom attribute this shift to changing social mores and a changing economy. Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant Pimco, notes that the share of profit in GDP is at an all-time high and income inequality has worsened during the period since Fiorina left the corporate world.\n\nAs the Republican primary race heats up, Carly Fiorina's business record and political stance will undoubtedly come under further scrutiny. Whether she can persuade voters that she is still representative of the business community and can navigate the complexities of the political arena remains to be seen.",
    " Title: The Controversial Role of Sugar in Obesity: A Closer Look at the Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, obesity rates among American adults have remained stable for the past 30 years, a finding that, while not entirely positive, is a departure from the steady increase observed in previous decades. This development has sparked a renewed interest in understanding the factors contributing to the obesity epidemic and its associated health issues.\n\nAt the heart of this ongoing debate is the role of sugar and sugary drinks. The link between sugar and the rise of obesity and diabetes in the U.S. is based on correlational rather than causational data. While it is prudent for individuals concerned with health to limit their consumption of sugary items, the \"sugar is toxic\" narrative, which has gained traction in some circles, is not supported by good science communication or public health standards.\n\nOne prominent figure advocating for this perspective is pediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig. In his book, \"Fat Chance: The Bitter Truth About Sugar,\" Lustig argues that sugar, particularly fructose, is the primary cause of metabolic disease. He claims that fructose is always metabolized to fat and that it drives various diseases associated with metabolic syndrome.\n\nHowever, Lustig's assertions are not without controversy. Mark Kern, Professor of Exercise and Nutritional Sciences at San Diego State University, has pointed out that many of Lustig's arguments are not scientifically supported. For instance, Kern argues that Lustig's claim that 95% of our calorie intake would be needed for fructose to significantly affect our metabolism is unfounded. Furthermore, Kern contends that Lustig's assertion that fructose is always metabolized to fat is incorrect.\n\nThis debate highlights the need for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to understanding the role of sugar in obesity and related health issues. While it is essential to limit our intake of nutritionally useless sugary calories, it is equally important to avoid sensationalized claims that may not be supported by scientific evidence. The media plays a crucial role in this regard, as it has a significant impact on public perception and behavior. A more balanced and questioning approach to reporting on this complex issue would be beneficial for all.",
    " Title: Global Elections to Watch in 2015: Kentucky Governor Race, Nigerian Presidential Election, and More\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 U.S. presidential race begins to take center stage, political enthusiasts can look to a series of significant elections in 2015 as a precursor to the main event. From gubernatorial and mayoral races in the United States to national elections abroad, the following list offers a diverse array of dynamic electoral battles that will serve as a warm-up for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIn the U.S. state of Kentucky, the race for governor is heating up as incumbent Steve Beshear, a Democrat, is barred from running due to term limits. His lieutenant governor, Crit Luallen, has announced she will not run, leaving the Democratic party in search of a strong candidate. Attorney General Jack Conway, who lost to Rand Paul in the 2010 Senate contest, is the only big-name Democrat to announce so far. Allison Lundergan Grimes, who lost to Mitch McConnell in the 2014 Senate race, is rumored to be considering a run. On the Republican side, Louisville Metro Councilman Hal Heiner and State Agricultural Commissioner James Comer have both entered the race. The Kentucky race will be closely watched as a barometer of the Democrats' ability to maintain support in traditionally red states.\n\nIn Nigeria, President Goodluck Jonathan is seeking reelection in February. The election will be marked by the violence expected from the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been responsible for numerous attacks, including the kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok last April. Jonathan's opponent, former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari, represents the All Progressives Congress, a coalition that has gained numerous defections from Jonathan's People's Democratic Party. The election will be a significant test of the Nigerian government's ability to maintain stability in the face of ongoing violence.\n\nSaudi Arabia's municipal elections, taking place for the first time in which women can vote and run for office, also make the list of 2015's hottest elections. Although women are still required to be accompanied by a male guardian and cannot drive to the polls, the elections mark a significant step forward for women's rights in the kingdom.\n\nSpain's general election will feature a contest between the right-wing People's Party (PP) and the left-wing Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), both of which are waning in popularity. Current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is leading the PP, but his administration's approval ratings have suffered due to unpopular austerity measures, accusations of corruption, and economic malaise. The PSOE, on the other hand, remains unpopular as well, with the country's unemployment rate still stubbornly high. The emergence of Podemos, a left-wing populist party that gained 8 percent of the national vote in the 2014 European Parliamentary election, is a wildcard in the race.\n\nFinally, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will be fighting for his political life in February as he seeks reelection. Emanuel's first term has been marked by controversy, but his path to victory was made easier when Karen Lewis, the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union and one of Emanuel's fiercest critics, announced she would not challenge him due to illness. Emanuel could still face a challenge in the city's runoff system, which might unite a fractured opposition should he fail to gain 50 percent of the vote in the first round. Anti-Rahm sentiment remains high, with an August Chicago Tribune poll finding that Emanuel's approval rating is only 35 percent. However, a recent poll from David Binder Research shows that his chief opponents, Ald. Robert Fioretti and Cook County Commissioner Jes\u00fas G. \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda, have yet to gain significant support.",
    " Title: House Approves Two-Year Budget Deal, Adding $1.7 Trillion to National Debt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that increases federal spending by about $320 billion annually and adds an estimated $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a two-year, $2.7 trillion budget deal on Thursday. The vote was 284-149, with all but 16 House Democrats supporting the plan.\n\nThe budget deal, which shatters budget caps and exceeds the spending levels set by the 2011 bill that imposed the so-called \"sequestration,\" is expected to make it more difficult to curb annual deficits in the years ahead. The U.S. was already projected to run trillion-dollar deficits for the foreseeable future, and the new budget deal will exacerbate this trend.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) acknowledged the fiscal challenges ahead, stating, \"We're going to have to make some tough decisions in the years ahead to make sure our fiscal house is in order.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who had previously pledged not to sign any bill that would increase the deficit, has been supportive of the new agreement. He met with Republican lawmakers for a lunch on Thursday, urging affirmative votes. In a tweet on July 25, 2019, Trump expressed his support for the deal, stating, \"I am totally with you!\"\n\nThe budget deal now moves to the Senate, which is planning to vote on the bill next week. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization advocating for balanced budgets, estimates that if the deal is signed into law, President Trump will have personally added $4.1 trillion to the national debt in a little over two years in office.\n\nRep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, reflected on the impending recess, stating, \"I already know most people are going to say 'look, you guys have a spending problem up there in Washington.'\" The budget deal's impact on the national debt is likely to be a topic of discussion during town hall meetings with constituents.",
    " Title: CNN Faces Ratings Struggles as Fox News Dominates Cable News Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cable news, one network is struggling to maintain its relevance, while another continues to thrive. As liberal networks debate whether to pull broadcasting pressers from the President of the United States due to personal disdain, one such network may find itself in a precarious position if it wishes to boost ratings.\n\nCNN, notoriously critical of the current administration, had a dismal first quarter, with no programs cracking the top 20 in the rating chart. President Trump, who has been a frequent target of the network, has returned the favor with his criticism. Fox News, on the other hand, has maintained its dominance, with eight shows in the top ten and 14 in the top 20. Even MSNBC, often criticized for its left-leaning bias, managed to break into the top 20 on multiple fronts.\n\nJohn Nolte of Breitbart noted that CNN's relentless pursuit of impeachment news may have contributed to its ratings decline, stating that it may have been detrimental to the health of the country (via Breitbart). Fox News' Sean Hannity topped everyone during the quarter with an average of 4.22 million viewers, more than tripling CNN's top show. In fact, the only Fox program CNN was able to beat was Fox and Friends First, which broadcasts before dawn and still managed to come in 40th with 721,000 average viewers.\n\nCNN's morning show, New Day, was outperformed by Fox and Friends First, attracting only 580,000 average viewers. Overall, Fox News had its biggest viewing quarter in the network's history, averaging 3.4 million primetime viewers and 1.9 million total-day viewers. CNN managed to average 1.43 million primetime viewers, with MSNBC coming in at 1.93 million. Fox News beat both combined during primetime.\n\nDuring primetime, CNN managed to lose to ESPN (1.43 million compared to 1.5 million), despite sports events being largely canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. This stark contrast in ratings underscores the significant gap between the two networks. If CNN's ratings continue to decline, it may face the possibility of losing its position as a major player in the cable news industry.\n\nWhile CNN's ratings struggle is not a new phenomenon, the network's anti-Trump stance and its role in the liberal opposition press have been a subject of criticism. If CNN's ratings do not improve, it may face the possibility of losing its influence in the media landscape, potentially leading to a shift in the political narrative. However, CNN's role as a major news network and its extensive reach ensure that it is not going away anytime soon. The president, though, has ammunition to continue his criticism of the network when its reporters attempt to antagonize him at press conferences.",
    " Title: Seattle Town Hall Discussion: Historians and Political Scientists Discuss the 2016 Election and the Factors Driving Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nAt a Seattle Town Hall forum, a group of scholars discussed the current presidential campaign, highlighting the role of polarization driven by rapid social change in making good politics difficult. The discussion, titled \"2016 Election: How Did We Get Here?\", was sponsored by the University of Washington Alumni Association.\n\nChristopher Sebastian Parker, a UW political-science professor, led the discussion and started by asking about Monday evening's debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The panelists, including Rick Shenkman, a Seattle journalist, historian, and social-science author, Mark A. Smith, a UW political scientist, and Margaret O' Mara, associate history professor at the UW, discussed the Trump phenomenon and the factors contributing to his strong showing in the polls.\n\nThe panelists agreed that Trump's emergence as a major-party nominee was due in part to his ability to speak directly to voters who want an outsider who understands their feelings. Shenkman's books, \"Just How Stupid Are We?\" and \"Political Animals: How Our Stone-Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics,\" highlight the lack of knowledge many voters have about political issues and the role of gut instincts in political choices.\n\nSmith pointed out that Mormons, who might have been expected to turn away from the Republican party due to their religious values, are not doing so, predicting that they will \"hold their noses and vote for Trump\" to maintain political consistency.\n\nThe panelists also discussed the role of isolation from opposing information in increasing political polarization. They noted that it is easier for people today to take in only information that confirms their beliefs.\n\nTrump's rise was also attributed to the frustration and anger many people feel, some of it driven by economic anxiety. O' Mara said that the two major parties have not adequately addressed this frustration.\n\nThe panelists also spoke about the role of race in politics today, with Smith stating that the biggest dividing line in the campaign is around racial identity. O' Mara noted that the debate on Monday was the first time a presidential candidate in a debate said the word \"racism.\"\n\nThe scholars agreed that whoever wins the election, the anger and polarization will still be present. Shenkman warned that \"when you're angry, democracy fails because angry people do not compromise.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, O' Mara found hope in the conversation, noting that the debate on Monday was the first time a presidential candidate in a debate said the word \"racism.\" In fighting anger, ignorance, and isolation, the scholars agreed that civil discourse and education are key to finding a way forward.",
    " Title: White House Delays Release of Progress Report on Islamic State Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has delayed the release of a progress report on the fight against the Islamic State (ISIL), initially intended to coincide with President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday. The report, which details the progress made by the 65-nation coalition led by the U.S., was delayed due to the intricate interagency and international coordination involved in its compilation.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted the delay on Friday, stating, \"I'll just be blunt with you, this is a document that we had planned to release in the context of the State of the Union address, and because there was so much interagency and international coordination involved in putting it together, the deadline slipped a little bit.\"\n\nThe report, now released three days later, claims that the coalition has made significant progress in its campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL. The report reaffirms the administration's commitment to eliminating the threat posed by ISIL and pursuing a strategy that targets the terrorist group at its core, degrades its networks, and constrains its expansion.\n\nThe report highlights several achievements, including the fact that 12 coalition countries have conducted over 9,500 air strikes in Iraq and Syria. Notably, over 630 of these strikes were in support of the liberation of Ramadi by Iraqi security forces.\n\nThe report also details the destruction of ISIL infrastructure, including over 3,450 vehicles and tanks, over 1,120 artillery and mortar positions, 1,170 oil infrastructure components, and more than 13,500 fighting positions, checkpoints, buildings, bunkers, staging areas, and barracks in Iraq and Syria. This includes the destruction of 39 training camps in the region.\n\nThe White House emphasizes the need for patience and flexibility in the ongoing fight against ISIL, acknowledging that this is a multi-year effort with challenges along the way. However, they maintain that the coalition is united and making progress together in degrading and destroying ISIL.",
    " Title: Polls Indicate Republican Advantage in Midterms as Obama's Approval Ratings and Perception of U.S. Direction Decline\n\nA new CNN poll suggests a significant advantage for the Republican Party in this year's midterm elections, as President Barack Obama's standing on terrorism issues declines and voter concerns about ISIS rise. The poll, released on Monday, also indicates that more Americans view the country as heading in the wrong direction, a common indicator of the electorate's mood.\n\nRecent days have also brought a series of polls in key Senate races that suggest Republican advantages in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alaska, with only a narrow Democratic lead in Colorado. The odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks before Election Day.\n\nVeteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres comments, \"It's much better to be a Republican candidate than a Democratic candidate, at least at the moment.\" He adds, \"Yes, the Republican brand sucks, but it is the President's image that dominates midterm elections, not that of our party.\"\n\nThe improving Senate climate for Republicans has reignited \"wave\" talk. Veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote on Monday, \"I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats.\"\n\nIn the CNN poll, the encouraging news for the President is that he and the public are largely in sync about the response to ISIS. A clear majority opposes American combat boots on the ground, but 50% support using other military force, up from 34% a year ago. However, the damning finding is that 67% say Obama does not have a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Additionally, only 37% approve of how he is handling ISIS, and just 41% approve of his handling of the broader terrorism issue.\n\nThe President's job approval rating remains stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April. Despite Democrats' insistence that they will again surprise with superior voter outreach and turnout, the numbers suggest a weak President and a worried electorate, the trademark ingredients of a wave or a significant shift in political power.",
    " Title: China's National Security Law: A Turning Point for Hong Kong and Implications for Taiwan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, China has taken a significant step towards redefining Asia's geopolitical landscape by announcing plans to impose a sweeping national-security law on Hong Kong, bypassing the territory's elected Legislative Council. This move, which will criminalize activities such as foreign interference, secession, and subversion of state power, has raised concerns about the future of Hong Kong's autonomy and its symbolic role as a beacon of relative freedom within China's communist system.\n\nThe proposed law, which could be implemented as early as this summer, also signals a willingness by Chinese President Xi Jinping to assert control over any potential separatist movements, regardless of international law or morality. This development comes 23 years after the handover of Hong Kong from British rule, a time during which the territory's importance as a financial hub has diminished, with Shanghai and other mainland financial centers emerging as major competitors.\n\nThe new law, if enacted, will not only erode the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong but also potentially alter the Basic Law, the territory's mini-constitution. China's security services will also be able to operate openly in Hong Kong, further reducing the territory's sovereignty.\n\nThe move to impose the national-security law on Hong Kong follows a steady erosion of the territory's freedoms over the past decade, culminating in massive demonstrations throughout 2019. The protests were sparked by a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed the rendering of Hong Kong citizens to the mainland, but were ultimately quelled due to international pressure and internal resistance.\n\nThe proposed law not only reveals a lack of trust in China's commitment to honor international agreements but also raises concerns about the future of Taiwan, a democratic island nation that has steadfastly rejected Beijing's attempts to force it into a similar one-country-two-systems model. The CCP's move to take over Hong Kong could be seen as a warning to Taiwan, potentially emboldening Beijing to take more assertive action against the island nation.\n\nThe international response to China's move on Hong Kong has been mixed, with some countries expressing concern and others remaining silent. The United States, however, has taken a firm stance, with the White House releasing a \"Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China\" that warns of Beijing's challenges to \"the bedrock American belief in the unalienable right of every person to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nIn response to China's actions, the United States should consider imposing travel bans on high-ranking Chinese Communist Party officials and military officers, as well as further sanctions on technology transfer to China. Washington should also offer immediate asylum to Hong Kong's democratic leaders and other at-risk individuals, such as academics, business leaders, artists, and the like.\n\nRestricting engagement with China and offering America as a haven for Hong Kongers are small steps, but they will send a message of hope to those resisting Beijing's attempts to redraw Asia's map. The future of Hong Kong and Taiwan remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: China's move to take over Hong Kong has far-reaching implications for the region and the world.",
    " Title: Solar Panels Installed on White House Roof: A Long-Awaited Step Towards Renewable Energy\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter a four-year delay, solar panels have finally been installed on the White House roof, marking a significant step towards renewable energy and environmental sustainability. The project, initiated by President Obama in 2010, was intended to serve as a symbol of the feasibility and environmental wisdom of renewable energy sources.\n\nIn 2011, Obama had announced plans to retrofit his family's new home with solar panels, with the generated power to be used for heating water and providing electricity. However, the project was put on hold until late 2013, when the installation process began. Due to security and other concerns, the White House has declined to disclose the exact number of panels installed or the total cost of the project.\n\nThe solar panels are expected to generate 6.3 kilowatts of solar power whenever the sun shines, according to the White House. The aim is to use this personal example to encourage families and businesses to take steps towards reducing reliance on foreign energy and cutting emissions linked to global warming.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz stated, \"Solar panels at the White House are a really important message that solar is here, we are doing it, we can do a lot more.\"\n\nThe installation process involved drilling down to the concrete on the White House roof and using epoxy glue and threaded rods to install a gridded subassembly onto which the solar panels could be secured. The solar components, converters, and the labor to install the panels were all sourced domestically, according to the White House, which declined to name the companies involved in the project due to security concerns.\n\nJames Doherty, the White House usher, explained, \"Being at the White House, we do have some security concerns. We can't cover the entire roof, although that would be good from an energy savings standpoint.\"\n\nSome climate change activists have criticized the years of delay as a lack of urgency. Bill McKibben of the environmental group 350.org stated, \"At this pace, we'll solve global warming right about the time that we're 30 feet under water.\"\n\nPresident Obama is not the first to deploy solar energy at the White House. President Jimmy Carter invested $30,000 in a solar water-heating system for West Wing offices in the late 1970s, but his successor, Ronald Reagan, removed the panels upon moving in. President George W. Bush's solar systems powered a maintenance building and some of the mansion, as well as providing heated water for the pool.",
    " Title: Expanded Roster of Attendees in Controversial Trump Tower Meeting Revealed\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of individuals who attended the controversial June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower has expanded, with the confirmation of a Russian-American lobbyist and two additional, unnamed participants. The meeting, which involved Donald Trump Jr., Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, and others, has once again brought to the forefront allegations of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nRinat Akhmetshin, identified by NBC as a Russian-American lobbyist, has confirmed his attendance to the Associated Press. Akhmetshin denied any ties to Russian intelligence agencies, but admitted that Trump Jr. had asked Veselnitskaya for evidence of illicit funds flowing to the Democratic National Committee. Veselnitskaya, however, claimed she did not possess such information.\n\nAkhmetshin also reportedly stated that Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner seemed eager for the meeting to conclude. Two more men are believed to have attended the meeting, including former State Department contractor Anatoli Samochornov, who has ties to Veselnitskaya, and another unnamed individual. A State Department source confirmed that Samochornov was never an employee and that the department does not provide translators for non-government private meetings.\n\nTrump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas, told Fox News that he could not confirm Samochornov's attendance, but stated that one of the two additional attendees was a U.S. citizen. Other reports have characterized an unnamed attendee as a \"former Russian counter-intelligence officer\" and a friend of Russian singer and billionaire heir Emin Agalarov.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) commented on the growing and still enigmatic meeting roster, stating, \"The additional and still unknown party or parties present during the meeting with these top Trump campaign personnel at the time Donald Trump had seized the nomination, adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.\"\n\nSchiff continued, \"Whether the additional party or parties present during the meeting with these top Trump campaign personnel at the time Donald Trump had seized the nomination were connected directly with Russian intelligence or not, it is clear the Kremlin got the message that Donald Trump welcomed the help of the Russian government in providing dirt on Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nNeither Kushner's attorney nor spokesperson have commented on this matter. Goldstone and Manafort did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.",
    " Title: The Unforeseen Consequences of a Trump Presidency: A Threat to Originalism and Limited Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the upcoming presidential election has sparked intense debate among conservatives and libertarians. Many are considering voting for Donald Trump due to fears of liberal control of the Supreme Court. The concern is that Hillary Clinton's judicial appointments would be detrimental, while Trump, despite his controversial nature, is perceived as a potential ally in appointing originalist jurists.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of a Trump presidency reveals a more complex and potentially damaging scenario. This article aims to shed light on the internal threats that a Trump presidency poses to originalism and limited government, surpassing the external threats that a Clinton presidency might present.\n\nWhile Trump's list of potential justices, including judges like Diane Sykes, Neil Gorsuch, and Robert Young, is commendable, it is crucial not to overestimate its significance. Trump's lack of understanding of the judicial system, his inconsistencies, and his volatile temperament are significant concerns.\n\nMoreover, a Trump presidency could have a transformative effect on the Republican Party itself. The GOP, as we know it, may not survive the Trump era. Trump's vision for the GOP aligns more with Europe-style workers' parties, such as France's National Front, which are authoritarian, nationalistic, and right-wing. This shift could lead to a rejection of federalism, separation of powers, and individual rights, as these principles are likely to be impediments to the party's new agenda.\n\nThe specifics of Trump's judicial philosophy are unclear, but it is likely to include sweeping executive powers, a narrow view of freedom of speech, and tight restrictions on civil liberties. If Trump succeeds in remaking the GOP in accordance with his vision, the party's judicial philosophy will change accordingly. The Constitution may not be a living document, but it is not written in stone. It is a malleable text, open to interpretation. There is nothing in it that says originalism is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, voting for Trump out of concern for the Supreme Court and originalism is a risky move. It is like handing the keys of your church to an arsonist clutching a can of gasoline in one hand and matches in the other\u2014and hoping that somehow he'd spare the inner sanctum and the holy book. He won't. The tragedy is that by the time Trump burns it all down, the GOP might well be past the point of caring.",
    " Title: US and EU Reach Agreement to Lower Tariffs and Avert Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the United States and the European Union have agreed to avoid an all-out trade war and work towards lowering tariffs, following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House. The agreement, hailed by Trump as a \"very strong understanding,\" marks a new phase in EU-US relations.\n\nThe threat of US tariffs on European cars has been put aside, with the EU planning to increase imports of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans. The two leaders agreed to \"work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.\"\n\nHowever, US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, imposed in March, will remain in place. A working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers, with both sides pledging to refrain from imposing new trade restrictions during these negotiations.\n\nThe looming trade war was fueled by the tariffs introduced by Trump, and EU-US relations had been further strained by Trump's comments on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nato, and the EU. Trump's language after meeting Juncker was markedly different, with the president calling it a \"very big day for free and fair trade.\"\n\nTrump has come under domestic pressure due to retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada, and Mexico. US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appears to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China, having dropped a $44bn bid to take over NXP Semiconductors after China failed to give approval for it.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmers hurt by the Chinese tariffs. Speaking at the White House, Trump declared a \"new phase in the relationship\" between the US and the EU, calling it a \"very big day for free and fair trade.\"\n\nJuncker thanked the president and hailed a \"constructive meeting.\" Trump said the EU would become a \"massive buyer\" of US LNG and the joint statement said EU imports of LNG would increase, to diversify Europe's energy supply. Trump has previously condemned Germany's project to expand imports of Russian natural gas.\n\n\"The EU is going to buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers, primarily in the Midwest,\" Trump said. EU officials have provided more details of the deal, stating that the working group will investigate long-term ways to reduce tariffs on industrial goods - not cars or agricultural products - and how to bring down the extra tariffs on steel and aluminum recently applied by US authorities.\n\nThe pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. \"We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,\" said an official.\n\nThis is not a revival of the controversial TTIP trade pact between the EU and US or a big free trade agreement. That would take much longer and would require the consent of the EU member states. The pair also agreed to work towards reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nTrump accuses the WTO of treating the US unfairly, though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there. Juncker said striking a deal on zero tariffs on industrial goods was his \"main intention.\"\n\n\"I had one intention today, to make a deal, and we made a deal. We have a number of areas on which to work together,\" he said. No announcement was made on car tariffs, and it was not clear whether any progress had been made on resolving the issue. Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars.\n\nOn Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the two were \"turning a page\" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted (in German): \"Juncker showed in Washington that it's really not about who tweets most aggressively, but about whether one offers real solutions. Because Trump's grassroots also feels that it only loses when we impose more and more senseless tariffs on each other.\"\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for \"clarifications.\" He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards.\n\nTrump scorned the proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which stalled two years ago. But his \"deal\" with Juncker echoes some of TTIP's ambition. A former US Ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, made that point in a tweet.",
    " Title: \"Iranian Cyberattack on U.S. Navy's Unclassified Network Lasted Over Four Months, Raises Concerns over Security Gaps\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA four-month-long cyberattack on the U.S. Navy's largest unclassified computer network has reportedly been resolved, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The attack, which targeted the Navy Marine Corps Internet, has raised concerns among some lawmakers about security gaps exposed by the incident.\n\nThe Journal, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported late Monday that the hackers were able to remain in the network until November 2021. This contradicts what officials told the Journal when the attack was first publicly reported in September, where they stated that the intruders had been removed.\n\nA senior U.S. official told the Journal that the Iranians were able to conduct surveillance and compromise communications over the unclassified computer networks of the Navy and Marine Corps. However, another senior official told the Journal that no email accounts were hacked and no data was stolen. There is also no evidence that Iran was able to penetrate classified U.S. computer networks.\n\nThe cyberattack is one of the most serious infiltrations of government computer systems by the Iranians. The Journal reported that U.S. defense officials were surprised at the skill of the hackers, who were able to enter the network through a security gap in a public-facing website.\n\nVice Adm. Mike Rogers, President Obama's pick to be the next head of the National Security Agency, oversaw the military response to the hack. Congressional aides told the Journal that Rogers would likely face questions on plans to fix security issues that have surfaced as a result of the attack. A confirmation hearing for Rogers has not yet been scheduled.\n\nDespite the length of the operation to remove the hackers, officials who spoke to the Journal praised Rogers for his leadership of the cybersecurity response. The issue is not expected to prevent Rogers from being confirmed as NSA director.",
    " Title: Congress Demands Private Emails of IRS and EPA Employees as Clinton Email Scandal Expands\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could further entangle the Obama administration in the growing email scandal, one of the tea party groups targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has called on Congress to demand the private emails of some agency employees. Meanwhile, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman has requested instant-chat messages from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as the Clinton email controversy begins to spread to other parts of the administration.\n\nThe White House, in an attempt to distance itself from the burgeoning scandal, has maintained that President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did use email, but insisted that the White House followed all record-keeping laws, and the president was unaware of Clinton's exclusive use of a private email until last week's reports.\n\nCatherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote, which had its tax-exempt application blocked for years by IRS employees, suggested that more than a dozen current and former IRS employees may have used personal emails to avoid public scrutiny while targeting tea party groups with intrusive scrutiny. Engelbrecht also called for congressional committees investigating the IRS to delve deeper into whether any agency employees used private emails for official business, citing Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account and server for official State Department business.\n\nIn a similar vein, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith has demanded more documents, including emails and text messages, from the EPA, threatening to use subpoena powers if necessary. The EPA has been criticized for failing to follow open records laws, with a federal judge last week blasting the agency for its lack of transparency.\n\nThe Clinton email controversy has taken a political turn, with the issue dividing Democrats and Republicans. While some Democrats have called for Clinton to be more forthcoming, others have suggested the issue is being stoked by Republicans eager to score political points against the presumptive front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe State Department has confirmed that every previous secretary of state also used a private email account, and it is currently requesting copies of official emails to complete its records. The department has already released 55,000 unclassified emails to the department, but it is unclear when they will be made public. The department has also released the 300 emails related to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, to Congress.\n\nAt the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said it is ultimately up to Clinton's team to decide whether to release more emails, and whether an independent arbiter should be called in to determine what should be turned over. The White House maintains that the policy of using private email for public business is not against the law, despite being the best practice.",
    " Title: Joe Biden Abandons Long-Held Support for Hyde Amendment, Aligns with Democratic Party on Abortion Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumed frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, has reversed his position on the Hyde Amendment, a policy that prohibits federal funds from covering most abortions. This shift in stance was announced Thursday night during a speech at a Democratic National Committee gala in Atlanta.\n\nBiden, who has long been a proponent of the Hyde Amendment, cited the need to ensure universal healthcare coverage and the full range of services for women as the primary reasons for his change of heart. He argued that the Hyde Amendment, which disproportionately affects poor women and women of color, is another barrier to abortion access in the United States.\n\nIn his speech, Biden affirmed his support for Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. He acknowledged that he, like many in Congress, had supported the Hyde Amendment for years, believing that women would still have access to the procedure without Medicaid and other federal health grants. However, he now argues that the ability to obtain an abortion through other means is being whittled away by Republicans.\n\nBiden's decision to abandon his long-held support for the Hyde Amendment comes amid mounting backlash from within the Democratic Party. The former vice president did not mention the mounting pressure or criticism he has received in recent days, instead crediting the change as part of developing a comprehensive healthcare proposal.\n\nThis is not the first time Biden has come under scrutiny for details of his decades-long political record. As a senator from Delaware, he led the Judiciary Committee that subjected Anita Hill to aggressive questioning during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. He has also faced criticism for his efforts to pass the 1994 crime bill and his support for the Iraq War.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, named for former GOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, was first passed in 1976 and is renewed annually by Congress. It bans federal funding of abortion, allowing exceptions only in cases of rape, incest, or when a pregnant person's life is at serious risk. Reproductive rights advocates argue that the law disproportionately affects women of color and poor women who seek abortions, as it prevents government health programs, such as Medicaid, from paying for abortions in most circumstances.\n\nBiden's support for the Hyde Amendment marked a sharp split from most of his 2020 competitors, as well as from the Democratic Party's platform. In 2016, the party amended its presidential platform to explicitly call for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nSeveral 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren, have all co-sponsored legislation to overturn the amendment. Other contenders, such as Sens. Cory Booker and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have previously pledged to repeal Hyde, while Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama, have all tweeted their opposition to the amendment.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Thursday that she was glad to see Biden had reversed course. \"At a time where the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Roe are under attack, we need full-throated allies in our leaders,\" she said. \"We're pleased Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party's core values\u2014support for abortion rights and the basic truth that reproductive freedom is fundamental to the pursuit of equality and economic security in this country.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Market Faces Historic Downturn Amid Coronavirus Fears and Uncertainty\n\nThe U.S. stock market has experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500 index posting losses for a fifth consecutive day. The Dow, which marked its biggest reversal from an intraday high since December 21, 2018, is now 8.78% away from its February 12 record-high close. This puts the index in close proximity to correction territory, defined as a drop of at least 10%, but not greater than 20%, from a recent peak.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also experienced losses, with the S&P 500 off 7.97% from its recent record high on February 19, and the Nasdaq off 8.52% from its February 19 all-time closing high. The recent decline for the Nasdaq is 1.48 percentage points away from representing a correction.\n\nThe market's downturn is largely attributed to fears of the COVID-19 disease, which originated in Wuhan, China, and has since affected global trade and travel. The World Health Organization has not yet declared the viral infection a pandemic, but the disease, from the family of viruses known as SARS, has sickened people in multiple countries, including the U.S.\n\nInvestors are uncertain about the duration and severity of the outbreak, as well as its impact on corporate earnings. A number of companies, including Hasbro Inc., HP Inc., and Mastercard Inc., have already expressed concerns about the outbreak's effect on their businesses.\n\nIn addition to the coronavirus outbreak, uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election's outcome is also contributing to market volatility. Some strategists and analysts argue that if Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is perceived as an antibusiness candidate, wins the Democratic presidential nomination and possibly even the presidency, stocks could take a hit.\n\nThe value of stocks has been viewed as rich, with the S&P 500 index trading at 18.9 times the weighted aggregate consensus forward earnings estimate among analysts polled by [redacted]. This is up from 16.2 a year ago and is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio for the benchmark index since May 2002.\n\nGovernment bond yields have been steadily declining as investors seek safe havens amid doubts about global economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The 10-year Treasury note yield and the 30-year Treasury note rate have both reached record lows.\n\nEconomists warn that a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 could result in a global economic slowdown that could potentially lead to a recession in the U.S. A Congressional Budget Office study found that a pandemic could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the U.S.",
    " Title: IRS Under Fire: Line Dancing Video Adds to Controversy Surrounding Agency's Spending Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing controversy surrounding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, the agency has come under further scrutiny following the release of a line dancing video featuring a dozen of its employees. The video, which was produced at a cost of approximately $1,600, was given to Congress last Friday in response to a request by Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe video, which lasts just under three minutes, was recorded at IRS offices in New Carrollton, Maryland, and was produced to be shown at the end of a 2010 training and leadership conference held in Anaheim, California. The conference has become the target of a report by the Treasury inspector general, set to be released next week, titled \"Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and Conference Abuses.\"\n\nRep. Boustany stated, \"Whether it is the tens of thousands of hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the IRS\u2019s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their personal beliefs, the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger.\"\n\nIn a written statement, the IRS acknowledged the video as \"unacceptable and an inappropriate use of government funds.\" The agency also stated that it has implemented new policies to ensure taxpayer funds are used appropriately.\n\nThe line dancing video features various IRS employees commenting on their colleagues' dancing abilities in the background to music that sounds like \"Cupid Shuffle,\" a 2007 hit by the performer Cupid. In the version obtained by The Associated Press, the employees' names have been erased.\n\nThe IRS has previously come under fire for producing two other videos, a \"Star Trek\" parody and a \"Gilligan's Island\" parody, which cost about $60,000 combined to make. The \"Star Trek\" video, which featured employees dressed as characters from the popular show, was produced for the same 2010 conference and was called a mistake by the agency. The \"Gilligan's Island\" parody was used at the beginning of a 12-hour video the IRS used in 2011 to train its workers on various tax issues.\n\nIn a separate statement, Danny Werfel, the IRS's new acting commissioner, called the 2010 conference \"an unfortunate vestige from a prior era.\" Werfel added, \"While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting, many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred.\"\n\nWerfel stated that the IRS has since instituted spending restrictions that include scaling back travel and training expenses by more than 80 percent since 2010. \"Taxpayers should take comfort that a conference like this would not take place today,\" Werfel said.\n\nIn a statement, the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, said it puts \"the highest priority on protecting taxpayer dollars.\" It added that it would work with Werfel as he reviews his agency's operations and tries to \"restore public confidence in the IRS.\"\n\nThe 2010 conference was attended by 2,600 IRS workers from 350 offices around the country that handle tax returns for small businesses and self-employed individuals. The hearing on the \"Collected and Wasted\" report is set to take place on Thursday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
    " Title: Rep. Darrell Issa Subpoenas More Benghazi Documents for Potential Insights on Changed Talking Points\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at obtaining more details regarding the altered talking points used in the aftermath of the Benghazi consulate attack, Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has issued a subpoena to the State Department on Tuesday. The subpoena demands additional documents from ten current and former employees, not included in the previous batch of emails from the department.\n\nIssa's request seeks documents from these employees, whom he believes could provide further insights into the process of changing the talking points and the reasons behind such changes. In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Issa expressed his dissatisfaction with the State Department's cooperation, stating, \"The State Department has not lived up to the administration\u2019s broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with Congress.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the talking points stems from U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's use of the points in her appearances on Sunday shows the weekend following the attacks. Republicans allege that the White House removed all references to \"terrorism\" from the talking points to achieve a political goal.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House turned over 100 pages of emails, which they claim show that CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell, not State spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, was the one who first suggested removing terrorism references from the talking points. However, Issa argues that the State Department's response failed to acknowledge the committee's request for all communications related to the talking points, from nine State Department officials.\n\nThe subpoena targets the correspondences of several key figures, including Victoria Nuland, Cheryl Mills, a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who Republicans have accused of being instrumental in the alleged political cover-up following the attacks. The requests also encompass the records of William Burns, the deputy secretary of State, and Beth Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, who has also been a subject of criticism by Republicans.\n\nIn response to the subpoena, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, argued that the investigation is politically motivated and an attempt to smear Clinton in advance of a potential 2016 presidential run. Cummings stated, \"House Republicans appear to be obsessed with Hillary Clinton and are distracting Congress from conducting responsible oversight to protect our diplomatic personnel serving overseas.\" He further added, \"This investigation has been politicized from the beginning as House Republicans accuse first and then scramble to find evidence to back up their unsubstantiated claims.\"",
    " Title: South Korea Disputes John Bolton's Account of U.S.-North Korea Summits, Calls Book \"Dangerous Precedent\"\n\nIn a dispute over the accuracy of former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton's account of President Trump's negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, South Korea's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, has labeled Bolton's version of events as \"distorted.\"\n\nBolton's memoir, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" set for release on Tuesday, has already stirred controversy with excerpts revealing discrepancies in the portrayal of the three U.S.-North Korea summits that took place from June 2018 to June 2019. In his book, Bolton claims that South Korean President Moon Jae-in set unrealistic expectations for the talks while pursuing his own agenda for Korean peninsula unification. Bolton reportedly describes Moon as \"schizophrenic,\" according to Reuters.\n\nChung Eui-yong stated that Bolton's account of internal deliberations between the heads of state is \"dangerous\" and sets a \"dangerous precedent.\" He added that the unilateral publication of consultations made based on mutual trust violates the basic principles of diplomacy and could severely damage future negotiations.\n\nPresident Trump has responded forcefully to the book, denying its claims and attacking Bolton as a \"wacko.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has also sued to block the book's publication, claiming that Bolton violated rules against publishing classified information. However, copies of the book have already been released to the press, making the lawsuit largely moot for the sake of protecting any privileged information.\n\nD.C. Circuit Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in the case on Saturday, denying a Trump administration request to block the book's publishing date. Lamberth also warned Bolton that if he did not receive approval from the administration before publishing the book, he could forfeit his $2 million book advance and possibly more.\n\nTrump cheered the ruling, tweeting that it was a \"BIG COURT WIN against Bolton.\" The dispute between Bolton and the Trump administration continues to unfold, with both parties presenting their perspectives on the events that transpired during the U.S.-North Korea summits.",
    " Title: Analyzing the Impact of Presidential Impeachment on Stock Market Performance: A Look at Trump's Claim and Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the political landscape in the United States continues to evolve, the potential implications of an impeachment process involving President Donald Trump have sparked discussions about its impact on the stock market. A key claim made by the President is that stocks would crash if he were to be removed from office. However, a less subjective approach to evaluating this assertion might be through earnings estimates and valuation, two factors that have significantly influenced the stock market during Trump's presidency.\n\nBefore delving into the specifics, it is important to acknowledge the unusually strong gains the stock market has experienced since the 2016 election. The S&P 500 has risen at an annualized rate of 20 percent, significantly surpassing the historical return of 9.4 percent since 1927. While the Trump return is slightly higher, it is worth noting that the gains during his presidency are only about 1 percentage point higher than the yearly gain since March 2009, a period primarily overseen by President Barack Obama.\n\nChanges in earnings forecasts under Trump have been stark compared to historical trends. In December 2017, analysts predicted S&P 500 earnings of about $146 a share for 2018. These forecasts, largely due to the president's tax cuts, soared over the next two months, rising four times as fast as any period tracked by the data. Companies delivered on these high expectations, with S&P 500 operating income jumping 24 percent in each of the last two quarters. Analysts now predict combined EPS of $159 a share for all of this year.\n\nPredictions for 2019 profits also soared, going from $163 a share at the start of the year to $177 a share currently, an upward revision that dwarfs any since at least 2012. Additionally, there has been a small increase in valuations, with the S&P 500 currently fetching 20.7 times annual earnings compared to 20.07 times on Election Day 2016.\n\nGiven these factors, it is challenging to ignore the potential role the president has played in the stock market's performance. However, it is essential to remember that the stock market is influenced by a multitude of factors, from policy to sentiment to potential consequences for the country's social fabric. Any one of these factors could significantly impact the market, potentially overshadowing anything related to corporate profits.\n\nIn examining Trump's claim about a potential stock market crash, investors might reasonably ask how much of the policy benefit would be rolled back if his presidency were threatened. Analysts have been skeptical about the President's impeachment prospects and the potential impact should it occur.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in London, stated, \"The market isn't hinging on anything substantial that hasn't already been carried through. The markets have largely rallied on tax reform, and we've seen that reflected in company earnings. But if there's political instability and the U.S. economic growth slowed significantly, that would have global implications.\"\n\nNicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note, \"Equity markets don't seem to care, and we think they are right. Rates are low, the dollar is strong, and corporate earnings remain robust. Those are the only things stock prices can (and should) actually discount.\"\n\nHistorical instances of presidential turmoil have shown contrasting stock returns. In February 1974, when Congress initiated impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, the market was in the midst of a bear market punctuated by an oil crisis and an implosion of the world's foreign exchange rate system. The S&P 500 tumbled more than 30 percent through October that year.\n\nIn contrast, in December 1998, when the House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton, stocks continued to rise during the last stage of the Internet boom. The S&P 500 climbed for five straight months until Clinton's acquittal in February 1999.\n\nAs of 9:45 a.m. in New York, the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged, and the index barely budged Wednesday in the aftermath of the convictions of Trump associates that sparked renewed discussion of a potential impeachment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the stock market's performance during Trump's presidency cannot be ignored, it is crucial to remember that the stock market is influenced by a multitude of factors. The potential impact of an impeachment on the stock market is complex and depends on various factors, including the extent to which the president's policies would be rolled back and the overall state of the economy. As analysts have suggested, the stock market may be resilient, particularly when monetary policy is accommodative, and it is currently arguably still accommodative.",
    " Title: Catalan Separatist Leaders Sentenced to Prison, Sparking Protests in Barcelona\n\nArticle:\n\nProtests have erupted in Barcelona following the sentencing of nine Catalan separatist leaders by Spain's Supreme Court. The leaders were convicted of sedition for their roles in an illegal independence referendum in 2017. Another three were found guilty of disobedience and fined but not jailed. All 12 defendants denied the charges.\n\nLarge crowds of pro-independence protesters clashed with police at Barcelona's international airport, with footage showing people attempting to break through a police line blocking one area of the building, while in another, officers hit protesters with batons and attempted to disperse the crowds with gas. A total of 108 flights were cancelled on Monday, according to Spanish airport authority Aena.\n\nThousands of Catalan independence supporters also marched in the city centre, blocking some streets and access to metro stations. The sentences handed down have shocked many across Catalonia, with anger swirling in the air along with the sound of whistles and loudhailers.\n\nThe longest sentence of 13 years was handed to Oriol Junqueras, the former vice-president of Catalonia and the highest-ranking pro-independence leader on trial, for sedition and misuse of public funds. The prosecution had sought up to 25 years in prison for Junqueras. Another prominent figure, Carles Puigdemont, former Catalan President, was issued a new European and international arrest warrant on grounds of sedition and misuse of public funds. He fled to Belgium in October 2017 to avoid prosecution in Spain following the failed independence bid.\n\nJunqueras accused Spain of jailing people for their political ideals and pledged that the separatists would return even stronger. However, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez insisted the leaders had been jailed for criminal conduct. Mr Puigdemont said the sentences handed to separatist leaders totaling 100 years were \"an atrocity.\"\n\nThose on the street communicated feelings of anger and powerlessness. \"Today is going to be historic, you can feel it in the atmosphere. Serious things are happening, we can't stay home,\" Oscar Quiles, a 47-year-old real estate entrepreneur, told AFP news agency. \"The indignation is just too much and affects too many people,\" another protester said. \"What they don't realize is that we are very angry and we will not stop.\"\n\nThe Catalan National Assembly called for \"mobilisations around the globe\" - including in the UK, France, and Germany - in a tweet using the hashtag #StandUpForCatalonia. Others used the hashtag to post footage of students marching in protest against the sentences moments after they were announced on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation condemned the prison sentences and called for \"dialogue and negotiation\" to resolve the situation. The federation added that it had suspended all football matches in the region to show solidarity with the leaders and their families.\n\nOver the weekend, hundreds of protesters rallied in the city. In 2017, police and protesters clashed in the streets when Catalonia's pro-independence leaders went ahead with the referendum, which had been ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court.\n\nThe prison terms given to the Catalan independence leaders were not the 25 years prosecutors had sought in some cases, but they are nevertheless seen as an outrage by many Catalans. The sentencing of the leaders has reignited the long-standing tension between Catalonia and Spain, with Catalan nationalists complaining that their region, which has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years, sends too much money to poorer parts of Spain, as taxes are controlled by Madrid. The wealthy region is home to about 7.5 million people, with their own language, parliament, flag, and anthem.",
    " Title: Tragedy Strikes Capital Gazette: A Call for Mental Health Awareness and Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a shooting occurred at the Capital Gazette newspaper office in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday. Five employees were killed, and two were injured. The gunman, identified as Jarrod Warren Ramos, has a history of hostility towards the newspaper, including a lawsuit and harassment of its journalists on Twitter.\n\nRamos was charged with five counts of first-degree murder. Tom Marquardt, a retired publisher and top editor at the paper, expressed his concerns about Ramos, stating, \"I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence. I even told my wife, 'We have to be concerned. This guy could really hurt us.'\"\n\nOn Twitter, Ramos hinted that he'd enjoy seeing two journalists \"cease breathing.\" The aftermath of this tragic event has left the Capital Gazette staff in a makeshift newsroom in a parking lot, determined to continue serving their readers.\n\nAs the media landscape grapples with this senseless act of violence, the usual cycle of finger-pointing, opportunism, and condemnation of cultural and political factors has emerged. It is human nature to seek an explanation for the unfathomable. However, it is crucial to refrain from hateful castigations and volatile rhetoric, as they only serve to dehumanize and further divide us.\n\nWhatever the reason for this massacre, it is clear that no sane person would commit such an atrocity. While there may be issues with the accessibility of weaponry and various toxic cultural influences, at the heart of this tragedy lies a mental health issue.\n\nIn light of this, legislation like the \"red flag\" gun bill, on the brink of becoming law in Massachusetts, may be a positive step. Although flawed, the bill focuses on the mental health aspect of gun ownership. Let's continue to work on this issue, regardless of the various political sensitivities at play.\n\nOur thoughts and condolences go out to the families of those who lost their lives and the survivors of the Capital Gazette shooting. We stand in solidarity with the journalists who continue to work tirelessly to bring the truth to light during this difficult time.",
    " Title: The Era of Policy Uncertainty: A Threat to Economic Growth and Prosperity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political climate, the United States is grappling with a pervasive sense of policy uncertainty, a term coined by economist Robert Higgs. This uncertainty, which stems from investors' concerns about the government's respect for property rights and potential changes in public policy, is hindering long-term investment and economic growth.\n\nThe concept of policy uncertainty is distinct from regime uncertainty, which Higgs originally defined. Regime uncertainty refers to a situation where investors question the government's commitment to respecting property rights, as in the case of land redistribution or drastic changes in tax laws. Policy uncertainty, on the other hand, arises when investors are confident in basic property rights but fear that changes in policy could render their investments unprofitable.\n\nFor instance, the Affordable Care Act's employer health-insurance mandate, which covers firms with 50 or more full-time employees, is a source of policy uncertainty. With the potential for changes in the mandate's threshold, businesses may hesitate to hire additional employees, creating a ripple effect on employment and economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, the taxation of private-equity firms and the potential changes in the taxation of carried interest income could significantly impact the private-equity sector. The Trump administration's proposed changes could more than double the tax burden for these firms, making it uncertain whether it's advantageous to invest in the private-equity sector.\n\nThe ongoing debate about NAFTA and its potential renegotiation or replacement also contributes to policy uncertainty, particularly for multinational corporations like General Motors and Apple, which have operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nAnother source of policy uncertainty is the national debt and the deficits that contribute to it. The debt presents straightforward problems, such as the potential for debt-service payments to become so burdensome that the federal government has no money left for other expenditures. However, there are other, less obvious problems related to the national debt, such as the temporary nature of tax cuts passed by Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are pushing for a temporary tax cut, which would expire in ten years. This approach, which is intended to bypass a potential Democratic filibuster, contributes to policy uncertainty, as businesses and investors are unsure about the longevity of tax cuts and their impact on their operations.\n\nThe lack of certainty on significant domestic policy issues, such as taxes, healthcare, entitlements, and more, is causing real costs for economic growth, employment, wages, and future prosperity. The charade of temporary tax cuts and accounting gimmicks, such as the Byrd Rule, which allows senators to block bills that would add to the deficit over a ten-year budgetary horizon, is contributing to this uncertainty.\n\nTo address this issue, it is crucial for the government to establish a reasonable, sober, and sustainable settlement on the national fiscal challenge. Only then can there be predictability, and with predictability, economic growth and prosperity can be achieved. The current state of policy uncertainty is not sustainable, and it is time for a change.",
    " Title: United States Announces Withdrawal from United Nations Human Rights Council\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council, as reported by Reuters. The decision comes a day after the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, criticized the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant parents from their children as \"unconscionable.\"\n\nThe move, which has been anticipated for some time, is primarily driven by the U.S.'s dissatisfaction with the council's perceived bias towards Israel. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, had previously stated that the U.S. would leave the council unless its \"chronic anti-Israel bias\" was addressed. Haley has also advocated for reforms aimed at making it easier to expel egregious human rights abusers from the council.\n\nThe U.S. had previously boycotted the council under the George W. Bush administration before rejoining under Barack Obama. The Trump administration's approach has been to withdraw from U.N. organizations perceived as having an anti-Israel bias.\n\nThe Human Rights Council, while mandated to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, has faced criticism for its membership system. This system, based on regional blocs, allows countries like Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Saudi Arabia to join without a full vote on admittance.\n\nWhile the council's focus on Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is warranted, it is criticized for being the only conflict with a permanent standing agenda item.\n\nCritics argue that the U.S., given its current domestic and international human rights concerns, may not be the most credible voice for reform within the council at this time. They suggest that it would be more productive for the U.S. to remain and advocate for reforms rather than withdraw.\n\nAs the Trump administration faces criticism for alleged human rights abuses at the U.S.-Mexico border, and with President Trump's comments suggesting a desire for American citizens to \"sit up at attention\" like they do in North Korea, the U.S.'s credibility on human rights issues is under scrutiny.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Fails to Contact State Election Officials Regarding Voter Fraud Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Trump administration's pledge to investigate alleged widespread voter fraud appears to have hit a roadblock, as top state election officials across the country have reported no contact from the White House or the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Huffington Post reached out to all 50 secretaries of state and election officials in the District of Columbia, and none responded affirmatively to having been contacted regarding the investigation. This raises questions about the administration's commitment to the probe, given President Trump's repeated claims of voter fraud and his promise to thoroughly investigate the matter.\n\nSpeculation about the nature of the investigation and the evidence to be presented has been rife, but some political analysts suggest that the lack of contact with state election officials may indicate a lack of substantive evidence. If the White House does release a report, it may rely on unverified sources or conspiracy theories, as some have suggested.\n\nThe lack of contact and potential reliance on unverified sources has led some to question the credibility of the investigation and the administration's commitment to fact-finding. The situation has also sparked discussions about the administration's approach to issues of integrity in elections and the importance of verifiable evidence in policy-making.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will be able to provide concrete evidence to support their claims of voter fraud. In the meantime, the lack of contact with state election officials has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about the nature and credibility of the investigation.",
    " Title: Moscow-Based Recruitment Office for Ukrainian Rebels Continues Operations Despite Kremlin Denial\n\nArticle:\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 A recruitment office for the Donetsk People's Republic, a pro-Russia separatist group in eastern Ukraine, is actively operating in Moscow, despite the Kremlin's denial of any involvement in the conflict. The office, which does not have a physical address, is recruiting fighters, raising funds, and collecting combat gear.\n\nThe recruitment process is facilitated through a phone number and email address, with detailed instructions appearing on Russia's VKontakte social network in June. The U.S. State Department acknowledged last month that the office exists and that Russia allows it to operate.\n\nVolunteers can join by contacting the number or sending an email. Recruitment efforts are also spread through fliers and banners at rallies in Moscow and on the internet, calling on Russians to \"Join Strelkov's Army,\" referring to Igor Strelkov, a former Russian security officer who heads the insurgency's militia.\n\nThe recruitment comes as the Ukrainian military intensifies its campaign against the pro-Russian insurgents and is closing in on the largest rebel stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia has amassed about 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's eastern border, according to NATO.\n\nThe U.S. and others accuse Russia of arming the insurgents who seized government buildings in the cities of Donetsk in April, proclaimed independence from Kiev, and pledged closer ties to Russia. Kiev then launched its offensive against the insurgents. According to the United Nations, about 1,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, have been killed in the clashes.\n\nThe U.S. and others say that weapons are continuing to cross from Russia into Ukraine\u2014possibly including surface-to-air missiles that may have downed a Malaysia Airlines jetliner last month, killing all 298 on board. Russia maintains it is not arming the rebels.\n\nSupport for the insurgency is widespread in Russia, where a majority of the population views the rebels as fighting a pro-Western regime they think is hostile to Russian-speaking people who live in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to recruitment, public efforts to gather aid are widespread, whether for volunteers, supplies, or money. A flier from Strelkov's militia requesting \"humanitarian aid\" listed a variety of combat gear, such as army boots, optical sights for AK-47s, night-vision glasses, and camouflage. The equipment is being gathered by a group called the Foundation for Aid to Novorossiya and Donbass.\n\nDuring a Moscow rally last week, the group filled a 5-ton truck with food, clothes, and military equipment. Among the donated items was a generator for an armored personnel carrier, the foundation said.\n\n\"Ordinary people will get this aid. Of course, some of this is for the militiamen. It will go straight to the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic,\" said Sergei Zakharov, a resident of Kramatorsk, Ukraine, who was in Moscow to help the foundation, as men loaded boxes into the truck.\n\nThe group said it raised 6.2 million rubles (about $177,500) in just over a month between June and July.",
    " Title: CNN Anchor's Laughter Sparks Controversy, Bolsters Trump's Base\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events that has sparked controversy and raised questions about political bias, a video of CNN anchor Don Lemon laughing hysterically during a live broadcast has gone viral this week. The clip, which was taken from a Saturday night segment, shows Lemon laughing uncontrollably and at one point slamming his head on his desk, apparently overwhelmed with laughter.\n\nThe segment, which featured ex-GOP strategist Rick Wilson and CNN contributor Wajahat Ali, began with Wilson joking that Donald Trump would be too stupid to find Ukraine on a map, followed by derisive comments about Trump's supporters, referring to them as the \"credulous boomer rube demo.\"\n\nLemon's laughter continued as Wilson and Ali exchanged more jokes, with Wilson mocking Trump's supporters with a heavy, stereotypical southern accent, and Ali joining in. The exchange ended with Wilson saying, \"Your math and your reading! Your geography and your maps!\"\n\nBy Tuesday night, Lemon was facing backlash over the clip, prompting him to address the controversy on his show. Lemon stated, \"Ask anyone who knows me, they'll tell you\u2014I don't believe in belittling people, belittling anyone for who they are, what they believe. During an interview on Saturday night, one of my guests said something that made me laugh. And while in the moment, I found that joke humorous. And I didn't catch everything that was said.\"\n\nLemon's defense that he \"didn't catch everything that was said\" has been met with skepticism, as he can be seen laughing consistently throughout the segment. Many believe that Lemon knew exactly what he was laughing at and, by refusing to apologize, he has made it clear that he doesn't see anything wrong with his behavior.\n\nThe incident has sparked debate about the impact of such comments on Trump's supporters. In the past, similar incidents, such as Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" comment, have been met with backlash but have also strengthened Trump's base. The segment could potentially turn off voters in rural areas who are on the fence politically, as the guests used stereotypical Southern accents to signify \"stupidity.\"\n\nThe clip also provides ammunition for Trump's favorite claims, such as the idea that CNN is \"Fake News.\" The video makes it easier for Trump to tell his supporters that all news coming from CNN is tainted with bias, making it less likely that they will believe any criticism from CNN or its affiliates.\n\nLemon, who has not apologized for his behavior, might want to consider the potential consequences of his actions on the network he represents and those who want Trump out of office. The incident has raised questions about the role of media in shaping public opinion and the impact of biased or derisive comments on political discourse.",
    " Title: The Importance of Honesty and Humility in Climate Change Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of climate change discourse, it is crucial to maintain a balance between scientific accuracy and honest acknowledgement of uncertainties. This was highlighted by Andrew Revkin, a renowned environmental reporter, in his 2021 article reflecting on his career at The New York Times. Revkin noted a growing disparity between the scientific understanding of global warming and the claims made by climate change advocates.\n\nWhile the increase in global temperature by 0.85 degrees Celsius (approximately 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880 is indisputable, along with the human influence on this warming, much of what is accepted as fact is actually a matter of probabilities. This is particularly true of the complex models and simulations used by scientists to predict future climate scenarios.\n\nThis acknowledgement is not a denial of science, but rather an honest recognition of its limitations. Hyperbole about climate change, Revkin cautions, not only misrepresents the science but can also be counterproductive if the aim is to engage a public that is often distracted.\n\nThe column argues that making absolute claims about the science of climate change can undermine the spirit of science, creating doubt whenever a climate prediction proves incorrect. Demanding immediate and costly policy changes raises legitimate questions about the ideological intentions behind such proposals. Moreover, treating skeptics with contempt alienates potential allies and hinders productive dialogue.\n\nThis is not to deny the reality of climate change or the potential severity of its consequences. However, it is important to recognize that ordinary citizens have a right to be skeptical of an overconfident scientism. They are aware, as all environmentalists should be, of the historical damage caused by scientific errors when combined with political power.\n\nThe epigraph for this article is borrowed from the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz, who understood the dangers of certitude. Perhaps if there had been less certitude and more questioning in the Clinton campaign, she would be president today. Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be open to a reasoned conversation about it.",
    " Title: Biden's Alleged Sexual Assault Allegations: A Looming Challenge Amidst the Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAs former Vice President Joe Biden continues his ascent towards the Democratic nomination for president, a new challenge has emerged in the form of sexual assault allegations made by Tara Reade. Reade, who worked for Biden in the early 1990s, has alleged that Biden sexually assaulted her and was subsequently retaliated against professionally for her complaint.\n\nThe allegations, which have gained traction in mainstream outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, CNN, and Politico, have received less media attention compared to similar allegations against other high-profile political figures, such as Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump. Even former Senator Al Franken, who resigned in 2018 following multiple allegations of groping women, received exponentially more media attention.\n\nThe muted coverage of Reade's allegations has been a topic of discussion, with some attributing the lack of interest to politics, bias, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Matt Continetti, Editor of the Washington Free Beacon, told Fox's Brett Baier, \"I'm worried that this is one area that Joe Biden may be being shielded by coronavirus. As long as the attention of the nation is on the pandemic, I think he may be able to skirt some of these questions for a little while longer.\"\n\nSo far, Biden has not directly addressed the allegations, instead focusing on the pandemic's impact on women during a virtual town hall. In the town hall, Biden boasted of his endorsement from Hillary Clinton and ignored the allegations entirely. There were no questions about Reade during the event.\n\nThe campaign has circulated talking points to top Democratic supporters, instructing them to say that the allegations \"did not happen.\" The lack of response from Biden and his campaign has raised concerns about the political dangers and credibility issues that the allegations may pose.\n\nFor starters, there are obvious political dangers. If voters find Reade's allegations credible and Biden consequently loses support, there is little the party can do after he is officially their nominee. There are also credibility concerns for Biden, the media, and the Democratic Party. Most acutely, there are concerns for Biden's Democratic women supporters, who risk their own credibility by defending Biden or remaining silent about the allegations.\n\nIn the #MeToo era, this is a precarious position for a progressive Democrat to take. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Michelle Obama, and the women who have either defended Biden or remained silent about the allegations risk their own credibility with women.\n\nIt is possible that Biden's assumption that voters' antipathy for Trump will supersede any qualms they may have with his behavior regarding Reade or any of the other women who have complained about unwanted touching is correct. Plenty chose not to care about the multiple allegations against Trump in 2016.\n\nHowever, that is even more reason for Biden, the Democrats, and the media to address the allegation fully and head-on, allowing voters to decide what to believe. This story is unlikely to go away, and pretending it isn't real is just ignoring a ticking time bomb.",
    " Title: Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Birth Control Rules Nationwide, Citing Potential Impact on States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Pennsylvania Eastern District Judge Wendy Beetlestone has issued a nationwide injunction, halting the Trump administration's birth control rules from taking effect across the United States. The decision was made due to concerns that states could be affected by the fallout associated with residents potentially losing contraceptive coverage.\n\nThe new rules, which were set to take effect in 37 states as of Monday, no longer mandate employers to provide birth control coverage for their workers under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the rules will not be implemented in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, following a judge's ruling in Oakland, California, that blocked the implementation hours before the rules were due to take effect.\n\nThe government has stated that the new rules \"protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors,\" but advocacy groups like Planned Parenthood argue that the rules could threaten birth control access for tens of millions of women who gained coverage when the ACA was implemented.\n\nUnder the ACA, employers were required to offer birth control coverage to their employees at no additional cost. Religious organizations that objected were previously exempt from providing coverage, but the Trump administration broadened the provisions to exempt any employers with either religious or \"moral convictions\" that would preclude them from offering birth control coverage.\n\nThe state of California filed a lawsuit to prevent the rules from going into effect. On Sunday, Judge Haywood Gilliam granted an injunction to those states that joined California's suit, but declined to block the rules nationwide.\n\nGilliam acknowledged that the ruling meant women in states not covered by the injunction could lose birth control coverage, but said the \"high threshold\" needed to implement a nationwide injunction wasn't met.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra hailed the decision in a statement Sunday. \"The law couldn't be more clear \u2014 employers have no business interfering in women's health care decisions,\" Becerra said. \"Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\"\n\nCourts previously blocked a similar rule the Trump administration attempted to implement back in 2017.",
    " Title: Economic Struggles for Renters and Landlords Amidst Pandemic Uncertainty\n\nThe mounting economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic is causing concern among apartment landlords, as they anticipate an increase in tenants' inability to make their rent payments beyond April. John Pawlowski, a senior analyst at real estate research firm Green Street Advisors, predicts that May 1 will be a significant turning point, as job losses have been accelerating.\n\nAccording to the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), only 69% of renters made a full or partial payment during the first week of April. By April 26, this figure had risen to nearly 92%. While dire predictions for April were largely inaccurate, the pressure on both renters and property owners is not expected to abate.\n\nGovernment programs, such as loan forbearance, expanded unemployment benefits, and direct payments to households, are intended to soften the blow, but their effectiveness is limited. The apartment industry, which includes small, local landlords as well as large, national companies, faces the possibility of financial strain, as mortgages, utilities, and property taxes still need to be paid regardless of rental income.\n\nLarge apartment landlords, including Equity Residential and Camden Property Trust, have reported strong collections, leading analysts to predict they will fare better than smaller owners. However, many factors will influence the ability of tenants to make rent payments, such as the timing of job losses, the receipt of stimulus checks, and the availability of state unemployment benefits.\n\nIn high-cost areas like New York and California, even government assistance may not be sufficient, according to Doug Bibby, NMHC's president. Smaller landlords, like Daryl Carter, the CEO of landlord Avanath Capital Management, are particularly concerned, as they manage properties across multiple states, including California and Florida. Carter offered a 10% discount to his tenants in April and anticipates a larger impact in May, as many of his residents work in industries like restaurants and hotels.\n\nIndividual renters, such as Chris Davis, a truck wash employee in North East, Maryland, are already struggling to make ends meet. Davis used his tax refund to help pay bills in March, but a two-week self-quarantine due to his daughter's illness meant he couldn't make the $785 April rent payment for his family's two-bedroom apartment. He is relying on his stimulus check to help him catch up and make the May payment.\n\nUndocumented renters, like a Brooklyn woman who recently lost her job as a home health aide, are also facing financial hardships. Unable to collect unemployment benefits, she is worried about running through her modest savings while trying to pay the $1,700 rent on her family's one-and-a-half-bedroom apartment. She plans to participate in a rent strike, joining others in an effort to pressure Governor Andrew Cuomo into forgiving monthly payments during the pandemic.\n\nBruce Brunner, a small landlord in Minneapolis, is taking a more collaborative approach, working with his tenants on a case-by-case basis to find solutions that are affordable for both parties. In recent weeks, he reports that nearly all his tenants have been able to pay because they still have jobs or have been able to collect unemployment.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to impact the economy, both renters and landlords face an uncertain future. The situation is forcing many to find creative solutions, such as rent reductions, deferments, and even rent strikes, in an effort to navigate the financial challenges posed by the ongoing crisis.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Urges President Trump to Cease Tweets Regarding DOJ Matters, Cites Impact on Job Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with ABC News set to air Thursday evening, Attorney General William Barr called on President Donald Trump to stop tweeting about Department of Justice (DOJ) matters, stating that the president's comments make it \"impossible\" for him to perform his duties as the head of federal law enforcement.\n\nBarr emphasized that Trump has never asked him to intervene in a criminal case, but he added that the president's comments surrounding the Roger Stone case have been detrimental to the image of the Justice Department, which has a tradition of independence.\n\n\"As I said at my confirmation hearing, I think the essential role of the attorney general is to keep law enforcement, the criminal process sacrosanct, to make sure there is no political interference in it,\" Barr said in the material released by ABC.\n\nBarr admitted responsibility for directing the submission of a second memo in Stone's case recommending a lighter punishment. The attorney general's comments followed a flap over the case involving Trump's adviser Roger Stone, in which prosecutors initially recommended between seven and nine years in prison for Stone, who was convicted by a jury last year in a case that stemmed from the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump criticized the recommended sentence on Twitter, and the same day, a senior Justice Department official told NPR that leaders at the department's headquarters in Washington found the suggested sentence too harsh. The department then directed the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., to submit a second memo seeking less punishment, which it later did. The four federal prosecutors who had brought the case to that point all withdrew, according to court records.\n\nBarr made clear in the interview that he made the decision, but the public response following Trump's post on Twitter made it appear that Barr and the department were bowing to the president's desire to protect his friend. Democrats have since demanded an investigation, and Barr has agreed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing scheduled for next month.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said later on Thursday evening that Trump \"was not bothered\" by Barr's comments. \"He has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions,\" Grisham said of the president. The press secretary also said Trump uses social media \"very effectively to fight for the American people\" and that he has \"full faith and confidence\" in Barr to do his job.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, signaled earlier that he believes Barr should retain his job at Main Justice. \"He is the right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the rule of law,\" Graham said in a statement. \"Attorney General Barr has my complete confidence.\"\n\nBarr's relationship with the Democratic-controlled House has been strained since a dispute with its chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., prompted Barr to skip a hearing last spring amid a dispute over witnesses and evidence. This week, Trump hailed Barr for \"taking charge\" of the Stone case, further compounding the perception that the attorney general was taking instructions from Trump. However, Barr clarified in the excerpted ABC News interview that this is not the case, but the appearance that he is puts him in a difficult position, which is why the attorney general says he wants the president to keep silent.",
    " Title: The Unforeseen Consequences of the Trump Presidency: A Political and Public Health Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls of electing a leader without the necessary qualities to navigate a national emergency. The warnings of Never Trumpers, who cautioned Republicans about Donald Trump's unpreparedness and unsuitability for the presidency, are now coming to fruition.\n\nThe petulance, lack of discipline, short attention span, narcissism, lies, and insatiable need for public praise and approval that were once viewed as charming quirks by Trump's supporters are now glaringly apparent as irredeemable deficiencies in an American president. As the nation grapples with the pandemic, these failings pose a significant threat not just to the presidency but also to the Republican Party, which has staked its future on Trump.\n\nThe Republican Party's gamble on Trump, who was acquitted in the Senate and initially appeared poised for a second term, now seems to be a Pyrrhic victory. In the 10 most competitive Senate races, Democratic candidates are outraising their Republican counterparts in eight, often by substantial margins. This shift is largely due to Trump's inability to manage the crisis effectively.\n\nRepublicans, who overlooked Trump's obvious character flaws, supported his presidency, and failed to remove him for impeachable behavior, are now facing the consequences of their political calculation. The party's reputation is at risk, with negative stereotypes about Republicans being reinforced, positive ones undermined, and a pall cast over a generation of Republicans who enabled Trump.\n\nCriticizing Trump today may seem easy, but just a few months ago, Never Trumpers appeared relegated to the political wilderness. However, the nature of presidential leadership is such that they must rise to the occasion when times are tough. Trump, who managed to survive three years, is now on the line, struggling to respond effectively to the pandemic.\n\nThe state of Ohio, once considered a reliably red state, is now swinging towards Joe Biden. Trump could even lose Arizona or his new home state of Florida. The situation looks even more ominous for the vulnerable Republican senators who backed Trump.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\" Trump's re-election does not guarantee his righteousness, as history has shown (see Richard Nixon). In the end, it is healthy when bad behavior comes with a cost.\n\nThe hope is that this experience will lead to a renewed appreciation for qualities like character, temperament, and experience. This would allow future Americans to benefit from what we are enduring now. As the Bible parable goes, one should always build their house on rock, because eventually, the rain comes, the streams rise, and the winds blow. The Matt Lewis interpretation is that no amount of public relations spin can save a house built on sand. The Trump Tower was always built on sand.",
    " Title: Israel Urges U.S. to Maintain Aid to Egypt Amid Political Instability\n\nArticle:\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel has reportedly engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to persuade the United States against suspending its annual $1.3 billion in military and economic aid to Egypt following the ouster of President Mohammed Morsi by the military. The aid suspension is a possibility under U.S. law, but the U.S. has yet to determine whether the June 30 removal of Morsi constitutes a coup.\n\nAccording to the Haaretz newspaper, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, and National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror have held \"marathon phone calls\" with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, respectively. The Israeli officials reportedly warned that a suspension of aid could negatively impact Israel's security, particularly in light of potential further security deterioration in the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nIsrael fears that any change in U.S. policy could undermine the Egyptian army's commitment to the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. The aid, which began as a result of the treaty, has been uninterrupted since 1979. The Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, has seen a rise in Islamist militancy since the overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak in 2011, leading to increased attacks on both Israel and Egypt.\n\nLast week, the Israeli army confirmed the deployment of Egyptian military reinforcements in the peninsula to address security threats. The 1979 treaty imposes strict controls on the numbers of troops permitted to operate there.\n\nIsraeli public radio also reported on Israel's efforts to dissuade Washington from halting aid to Cairo. An Israeli official told the station that Egypt was likely to experience \"a period of chronic instability.\" The official added, \"The Muslim Brotherhood will not easily give up power. We must expect more violence and perhaps more changes in the leadership.\"\n\nSince Morsi's ouster, Netanyahu has ordered his ministers to remain silent on the political crisis in Egypt. The Israeli government has not confirmed or denied the Haaretz report.",
    " Title: New CNN/ORC Poll: Hillary Clinton Leads Democratic Race, No Clear Leader in GOP Contest\n\nThe 2016 presidential race is heating up as more candidates declare their intentions, with the Democratic and Republican nominations showing distinct trends, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintains a strong lead, with no significant competition. In the Republican race, however, no clear front-runner has emerged despite the recent entries of Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz.\n\nJeb Bush currently holds the top spot among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, with 17% of the vote. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker follows closely behind with 12% support. Rubio and Paul stand at 11% each, while former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Texas Senator Ted Cruz are at 9% and 7% respectively.\n\nNotably, two candidates who previously placed second in CNN/ORC polls, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, are now trailing behind the leaders with 4% each.\n\nBush's lead in the nomination contest is slight, and several contenders could potentially overtake him with a small increase in support. The poll indicates that Bush is perceived as the candidate with the right experience to be president (27%), the one with the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in the general election (26%), and the strongest leader in the large field of GOP contenders (21%). He is also seen as the candidate with the clearest vision for the country's future (19%), who cares the most about people like you (18%), and who most closely shares your values (19%).\n\nHowever, on the question of who best represents the future of the Republican Party, Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied at 18%. Paul is the only other candidate in double digits on this question, with 10%.\n\nThe poll suggests a competitive and dynamic race on both sides of the aisle, with the Democratic and Republican nominations yet to be decided.",
    " Title: The Shutdown's Impact on the American Economy and the Overshadowing of the Obama Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has dominated the headlines, overshadowing the persistent issues of the American economy and the Obama administration's economic record. The quality of life in the United States has reportedly taken a significant hit during the Age of Obama, with the American dream seemingly slipping away, the economy struggling, and job creation remaining slow.\n\nInstead of unifying the nation, President Obama's politics have been criticized for creating a divide, with class warfare being a prominent theme. The President came into office as the nation was grappling with a deep recession, from which it has yet to fully recover. Despite promises of delivering good-paying, full-time jobs, the administration has not succeeded in delivering on this promise.\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act, or Obamacare, has been a contentious issue, with many arguing that its regulations, taxes, penalties, and costly mandates are negatively impacting the economy and job creation. Small businesses are reportedly laying off workers or reducing their hours to avoid providing health insurance and falling under the threshold of full-time employees.\n\nThe focus on the government shutdown, with its associated furloughs, closed national parks, and economic impact, has seemingly eclipsed any discussion about the Obama economy, high unemployment, slow job creation, and weak economic growth. In a perverse twist, the shutdown battle has provided President Obama with a temporary reprieve from what is widely considered his biggest failure as president: the economy.\n\nThe political debate has centered on the shutdown, with Republicans hoping it would spark a needed discussion on Obamacare, delay its mandates, and potentially lead to a change in the Senate in 2014. However, this has not materialized, and the political discourse remains focused on the shutdown.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, there are growing concerns about its economic impact, with the stock market tanking, tourists unable to visit government landmarks, and food-safety inspectors and national-security analysts off the job. These factors have effectively silenced any discussion about the Obama economy, high unemployment, slow job creation, and weak economic growth.\n\nIn an effort to counter the President's narrative, House Speaker John A. Boehner's podium has been largely ineffective, with Republicans seemingly struggling to articulate the economic harm caused by Obamacare. The late, great Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman and vice-presidential candidate, was known for his effective tax-cut arguments and anti-class warfare stance, which helped lead the nation out of a severe recession in the 1980s.\n\nRepublicans should be using these arguments to criticize the Obama administration's economic record, particularly in relation to Obamacare, and presenting the data showing how it is negatively impacting the economy and job creation. A Washington Post-Miller Center Poll from late last month revealed a large majority of Americans have a much dimmer view of their economic future, with many finding it harder to \"find good jobs,\" \"save for retirement,\" \"get ahead financially,\" and \"find decent, affordable housing.\"\n\nIt is crucial for Republicans to take off the gloves and start hitting back harder in this shutdown fight, using the powerful ammunition they have to highlight the economic harm caused by Obamacare and the administration's overall economic record.",
    " Title: Global June Temperatures Break Record for Third Consecutive Month in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal scientists announced on Monday that June 2015 was the hottest June on record for the planet, marking the third consecutive month of record warmth globally. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information reported that the globally averaged temperature over land and ocean surfaces for June 2015 was the highest for the month of June since record-keeping began in 1880.\n\nThe record warmth was not limited to June alone, as other global data sets from NASA and the Japan Meteorology Agency also reported on June's record warmth. Record warmth was seen in June in the western U.S., parts of northern South America, several regions in central to western Africa, central Asia, and parts of southeastern Asia, according to the centers.\n\nJune 2015 broke the previous record for warmest June, set just last year, according to NOAA's data. Earlier this year, both March and May set marks for record warmth. The U.S., overall, had its second-warmest June on record, the centers announced last week. Only June 1933 was hotter. Five western states \u2014 California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Utah \u2014 were all record warm.\n\nThe hot June continues the pattern of unusual warmth seen throughout the year. So far, the first six months of the year have been the warmest on record, due in part to El Ni\u00f1o, a climate pattern marked by warmer-than-average water in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The heat from the warm water helps boost temperatures in the atmosphere around the world.\n\nWhile El Ni\u00f1o is a part of the warmth, the long-term trend of man-made climate change is also a contributor. NOAA reports that 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, many during years without the boost of an El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nJanuary-June was 1.53 degrees F warmer than average worldwide, NOAA said.",
    " Title: Trump Warns of Traffic and Commercial Delays at U.S.-Mexico Border Due to Increased Immigration Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a warning on Saturday about potential traffic and commercial delays at the U.S.-Mexico border due to increased immigration enforcement. The president's tweet came after the administration's decision earlier this week to increase the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump stated, \"We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border's specific Ports of Entry to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States.\" He continued, \"This will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use... its powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin.\"\n\nThe president also urged congressional Democrats to collaborate with Republican lawmakers to address the \"horrible, costly and foolish loopholes\" in U.S. immigration statutes. He tweeted, \"Once that happens, all will be smooth.\" Trump concluded his tweet with a firm statement, \"We can NEVER allow Open Borders!\"\n\nOn Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen directed Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to expedite the \"temporary reassignment of personnel and resources from across the agency to address the influx of migrants.\" Nielsen also announced plans to require that greater numbers of non-Mexican asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while they wait for their cases to be resolved.\n\nTrump had earlier threatened to shut down the southern border, but on Thursday, he suggested imposing auto tariffs on Mexico as an alternative measure to curb the rate of illegal drugs entering the U.S. \"Before we close the border, we'll put the tariffs on the cars,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I don't think we'll ever have to close the border.\"\n\nThe U.S. is currently experiencing a surge in Central American migrants, many of whom are seeking asylum. The Trump administration has been implementing various measures to address this issue, including increased border patrol, detention facilities, and changes to asylum policies. The administration's actions have been met with criticism from human rights groups and some lawmakers, who argue that the policies are inhumane and violate international law.",
    " Title: John Dowd Calls for End to Mueller Investigation, Cites Corruption Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of emails to Betsy Woodruff at the Daily Beast on Saturday, John Dowd, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, called for the Russia probe to be shut down and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation to be ended. Dowd, who initially spoke on behalf of the president but later clarified that he was speaking in his personal capacity, cited corruption allegations and compared the Russia investigation to a \"fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\nDowd's email followed the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Friday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In his email, Dowd praised Sessions' decision and urged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to follow suit by ending the Mueller investigation. He wrote, \"I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\nSessions' recusal from matters related to the 2016 campaign means that Rosenstein is overseeing Mueller's probe and is the one with the ability to fire the special counsel. Dowd also included an annotated version of a line from the Tennessee Williams play, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" in his email, stating, \"What's that smell in this room [Bureau]? Didn't you notice it, Brick [Jim]? Didn't you notice a powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room [Bureau]?... There ain't nothin' more powerful than the odor of mendacity [corruption]... You can smell it. It smells like death.\"\n\nTrump has been flirting with publicly calling for Mueller to be fired for a while, but he has not yet done so. The president has publicly and privately expressed anger at Sessions over his recusal from the case of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and he has engaged in a sustained attack against Sessions, the FBI, and the Justice Department. In a tweet on Friday, Trump celebrated McCabe's firing as a \"great day for Democracy.\"\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-VA) and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA) both condemned Dowd's call for the end of the Mueller investigation. Warner tweeted, \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now.\" Schiff tweeted, \"Every representative should condemn this flagrant abuse of power or stop pretending devotion to duty.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) previously stated that if Trump were to fire Mueller, it would be \"the end of President Trump's presidency.\"\n\nThe call for the end of the Mueller investigation comes just two days after a New York Times report that Mueller has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, including some related to Russia. The White House has not yet responded to the report.",

This comes as members of Congress reconsider their stance on military aid to Egypt.\n\nSen. \u2588\u2588\u2588, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees, introduced an amendment last month aimed at halting aid to Egypt during the current unrest. He cited two primary reasons: first, the U.S. law mandates aid suspension following a coup, and the events in Egypt meet the conventional definition of a coup. Second, a nation in conflict should not be armed with American weapons, as they were used against protesters during the overthrow of the previous regime.\n\nThe senator questioned the logic of providing $1.5 billion in aid when the situation is unclear and the American national interest is not evident. He argued that sending military aid during this volatile period could exacerbate problems rather than resolve them.\n\nSen. \u2588\u2588\u2588's amendment failed three weeks ago, with 86 senators voting against it and only 12 Republicans in support. However, in recent days, images of unarmed protesters attempting to halt tanks (American tanks operated by the Egyptian military) have surfaced, with one unarmed man being shot while trying to stop a tank.\n\nSen. \u2588\u2588\u2588 contends that sending more American tanks and fighter jets is not engagement, but rather breeds discontent and dislike of America among the Egyptian people. He criticized the hyper-interventionism in Washington, where leaders seem to act first and think second, insisting on sending aid without considering the potential consequences.\n\nSen. \u2588\u2588\u2588 called on lawmakers to learn from the past, citing numerous instances of unconditional aid to tyrannical dictators that have yielded little benefit to the United States while causing harm to the people of the countries being aided. He expressed hope that the current situation in Egypt serves as a teachable moment for Washington, urging lawmakers to reconsider their approach to foreign aid.",
    " Title: President Trump Delivers Remarks at National Prayer Breakfast Amidst Impeachment Acquittal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his Senate acquittal on impeachment charges, President Donald Trump delivered a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, taking veiled jabs at his opponents while addressing the theme of the event, \"love your enemies.\"\n\nDuring his speech, President Trump criticized individuals he perceived as hypocritical in their faith, seemingly referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Mitt Romney, who was the lone Republican senator to vote for his conviction.\n\n\"I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,\" Mr. Trump said, with Mrs. Pelosi seated near him on the dais. \"Nor do I like people who say 'I pray for you' when they know that that's not so.\"\n\nThe president's comments came a day after the Senate acquitted him in his impeachment trial. During the impeachment inquiry, Mrs. Pelosi had stated that she had prayed for Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president's remarks also appeared to be in reference to Senator Romney, who cited his faith on Wednesday when he voted to convict Mr. Trump.\n\nThroughout his speech, President Trump spoke about the ordeal his family, the country, and himself had been through during the impeachment process, stating, \"They have done everything possible to destroy us. And by so doing, very badly hurt our nation.\"\n\nThe president is scheduled to give a statement about his acquittal at the White House around noon.\n\nThe theme of the prayer breakfast was \"love your enemies.\" Keynote speaker Arthur Brooks, a Harvard University professor, emphasized Jesus Christ's message to \"answer hatred with love.\"\n\nWhen President Trump reached the podium, he turned to Mr. Brooks and said, \"Arthur, I don't agree with you.\" He praised the faithful in the ballroom for loving others but added, \"sometimes they hate people.\"\n\nHouse Co-host of the breakfast, Rep. Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat, acknowledged the difficulty of the message, stating, \"Love your enemies' is a tough message. Not everybody seems to get it yet, but we're going to work on it.\"\n\nPresident Trump thanked Republican lawmakers who voted against impeachment, stating, \"Courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, fortitude, and strength to do what everyone knows was right.\"\n\nThe president also highlighted his support for freedom of religion, his pro-life policies, and his support for prayer in schools. He concluded by urging voters to support him in the upcoming election, stating, \"You'd better get out and vote on Nov. 3, you have a lot of people out there who are liking what we're doing.\"\n\nAs he entered the ballroom for the breakfast at the Washington Hilton, Mr. Trump held aloft front-page newspaper headlines proclaiming him \"acquitted\" to applause, including from Mrs. Pelosi. Upon reaching his seat on the dais, Mr. Trump picked up a copy of USA Today from the table and held up the front page to show the audience the banner headline \"Acquitted\" above his photo.\n\nMrs. Pelosi was seated on the opposite side of the dais and came to the podium to offer a prayer. She didn't acknowledge the president, in their first encounter since she ripped up a copy of his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nReading from several pages of paper, Mrs. Pelosi prayed for those persecuted across the globe, including journalists in Saudi Arabia. She prayed that \"we treat everyone with dignity and respect.\" When she finished, she turned away from the podium and returned to her seat without looking at Mr. Trump.",
    " Title: Trump Opposes Proposed Restrictions on U.S. Companies Supplying China's Aviation Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump objected on Tuesday to U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China's aviation industry, suggesting he had instructed his administration not to implement them.\n\nIn a series of tweets and comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said national security concerns, which had been cited as reasoning for the plans, should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products.\n\nThe president's comments came after weekend reports by Reuters and other news media that the government was considering whether to stop General Electric Co (GE.N) from further supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger jet.\n\nTrump's intervention illustrated that, at least in this case, he would prioritize economic benefits over potential competitive pitfalls and national security concerns. His views on the issue contrasted with the sharp restrictions his administration has placed on U.S. companies trading with Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, also for national security reasons.\n\n\"We're not going to be sacrificing our companies... by using a fake term of national security. It's got to be real national security. And I think people were getting carried away with it,\" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before departing for a trip to California.\n\n\"I want our companies to be allowed to do business. I mean, things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security, including with chipmakers and various others. So we're going to give it up, and what will happen? They'll make those chips in a different country or they'll make them in China or someplace else,\" he said.\n\nThe United States has supported American companies' business with China's aviation sector for years. \"I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed, with no excuses...\"\n\nTrade lawyer Doug Jacobson said limitations on jet engines and chip makers would hurt U.S. companies. \"This is ultimately akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face because ultimately you're hurting U.S. manufacturing companies but you're not having a material impact on your target,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two largest economies, have a complicated and competitive relationship. Trump signed a first-phase trade deal with China earlier this year after a long trade war in which the countries levied significant tariffs on each other's products, many of which remain in place.\n\nWashington is also eyeing limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). Central to the possible crackdown is whether shipments of U.S. parts to China's aircraft industry could fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co (BA.N) or boost China's military capabilities.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said it welcomed Trump's comments. \"We applaud President Trump's tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,\" John Neuffer, the group's president, said in a statement. \"As we have discussed with the administration, sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America's economic strength and national security.\"\n\nHuawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China. Washington placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. The United States has also been trying to persuade allies to exclude its gear from next-generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim.\n\n\"So, national security is very important. I've been very tough on Huawei, but that doesn't mean we have to be tough on everybody that does something,\" Trump said.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Covington Catholic High School Incident: A Closer Look at Nathan Phillips' Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nIn the aftermath of the Covington Catholic High School incident in Washington D.C., where a confrontation between Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist, and a group of students wearing MAGA hats occurred, several discrepancies have emerged in Phillips' account of the events.\n\nFollowing investigations by both the New York Times and the Washington Post, it has been revealed that Phillips, contrary to his claims, was not a Vietnam or \"Vietnam times\" veteran. Instead, he was a stateside refrigerator technician who was frequently absent without leave (AWOL).\n\nFurthermore, it has come to light that Phillips made similar allegations against a few college students four years ago. However, a video of the incident, which quickly spread on Twitter, portrayed a different narrative.\n\nInitially, many journalists, including some on the left, uncritically accepted Phillips' account of the incident. The image, which depicted an elderly Native American surrounded by a group of smirking pro-Trump teens, seemed to reinforce preconceived notions.\n\nHowever, full videos of the incident soon revealed that Phillips was the one who approached the students unprovoked, beating a drum just inches from their faces. Contrary to Phillips' claims, the Covington school students were being taunted with racist and homophobic slurs by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites.\n\nPhillips asserted that the kids were \"in the process of attacking these four black individuals\" and \"looked like they were going to lynch them,\" leading him to intervene. Yet, it is puzzling why Phillips did not beat his drum at the \"Israelite\" aggressors.\n\nThe video also contradicts Phillips' claims that the students were defiantly chanting \"Build that wall.\" There is no evidence of such chanting in the video, nor does it feature Phillips saying anything that sounds like an effort to pacify the situation.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies, Phillips continues to have supporters, as he persistently crafts new narratives that appeal to left-liberal prejudice.

    " Title: Unconventional Fundraising Tactics: A New Era in Political Campaign Financing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political campaign fundraising, creativity and novelty have become the new norm as candidates strive to stand out in a crowded media landscape and raise record amounts of cash.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's campaign has taken an unconventional approach, suggesting that wedding registries could include the campaign, and merchandising Vice President Joe Biden's gaffes, such as the \"Health Reform Still a BFD\" t-shirt. The campaign has also capitalized on the popularity of the Obama family's dog, Bo, by selling presidential dog bones, with the proceeds benefiting the president.\n\nA recent example of this trend can be seen in the campaign of Pam Gulleson, a Democratic congressional candidate from North Dakota. In late June, Gulleson's Ford Five Hundred broke down on the campaign trail. In response, she sent an email to supporters, stating, \"If 80 people give just $25, that'll pay for the repairs. And don't forget \u2013 our fundraising deadline ends tonight at midnight!\"\n\nThe effectiveness of this fundraiser is uncertain, as the Gulleson campaign declined to comment on the matter. Her Republican opponent, Kevin Cramer, acknowledged Gulleson's creativity but questioned its value, stating, \"She's taking so much ridicule and ribbing for it up here on the blogs and talk radio that I'm not sure it was worth it for her. Who knows \u2013 maybe she raised $10,000. But I kind of doubt it.\"\n\nGimmicky (and fixed) raffles, offering access to candidates at dinners or sporting events, or face time with Hollywood royalty, are also becoming more common in fundraising events. While traditional fundraisers such as rubber chicken lunches and after-work receptions are not extinct, the 2012 election, expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, with a projected cost of at least $5.8 billion, requires seven-figure fundraising for even the most minor congressional races to ensure competitiveness.\n\nNovel fundraisers also align with a surge of new donation options this cycle, such as text message, Twitter, and mobile credit card readers, making political contributions easier than ever. Campaigns are eager to connect with younger voters, said Kristin Oblander, president of Atlanta-based political fundraising firm The Oblander Group.\n\n\"They work because you literally get buy-in with young professionals in particular who will stay on your email lists, like you on Facebook, connect on Twitter,\" Oblander said. \"You just can't have the same old 100 folks in a smoky back room anymore.\"\n\nThis shift in fundraising tactics can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) first ran for Congress. His campaign cash solicitations via direct mail seemed revolutionary at the time. \"I'd have balloon rides and parachute jumping,\" said Gordon, now a partner at law and lobbying firm K & L Gates, without a hint of sarcasm. \"Candidates just have to find more and more novel ways to break through the clutter of so many fundraisers.\"",
    " Title: EPA Chief Lisa Jackson Resigns Amidst Speculation of Keystone XL Pipeline Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Lisa Jackson has resigned from her position, citing personal reasons and a desire to pursue new challenges, time with her family, and new opportunities. This sudden departure has sparked speculation that Jackson's resignation may be linked to the ongoing debate over the Keystone XL pipeline, with some sources suggesting that her departure could be a response to President Obama's reported plans to approve the project.\n\nAccording to a report by the New York Post, citing an unnamed source close to Jackson, the EPA chief was convinced that President Obama was planning to green-light the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. The source claimed that Jackson had initially intended to stay in her position until November or December, but her resignation was prompted by the president's alleged decision to support the pipeline's construction.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, a proposed 1,700-mile oil pipeline, has been a contentious issue for years, with environmental activists opposing the project on principle. Despite the ongoing review by the State Department, the pipeline's eventual completion seems increasingly likely, as TransCanada, the pipeline's developer, has proposed new routes to address environmental concerns and the administration continues to clear bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline is considered a safe and efficient means of transporting oil, with terrestrial pipelines being the preferred method for transporting oil sands. The oil is set to be extracted regardless of whether the pipeline is built in the U.S. or in China.\n\nJackson's resignation comes amidst controversy over her use of an extracurricular email account, and it is unclear whether this is the sole reason for her departure. However, the timing of her resignation and the ongoing Keystone XL debate has led some to speculate that Jackson may have been displeased with President Obama's energy policy direction, particularly in light of the potential approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nThe State Department's review of the Keystone XL pipeline is still ongoing, and it remains to be seen when President Obama will make a final decision on the project. However, with Jackson's departure and the speculation surrounding her resignation, it seems that the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline may be drawing nearer.",
    " Title: Germanwings Co-Pilot Treated for Suicidal Tendencies Before Fatal Crash, Raising Questions About Medical Confidentiality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic Germanwings jet crash that claimed the lives of all 150 passengers and crew, new details have emerged about the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who was at the controls during the incident. According to a statement from the public prosecutor's office in D\u00fcsseldorf, Mr. Lubitz had undergone treatment for \"suicidal tendencies\" over a prolonged period.\n\nThe Airbus A320 jet, under Mr. Lubitz's control, plunged from cruising altitude into the French Alps last week, leading French officials to conclude that the crash was not an accident but an intentional act by the co-pilot. Mr. Lubitz, aged 27, had received treatment from psychotherapists without specific dates being disclosed. The prosecutor's statement also noted that during subsequent visits to doctors, no signs of suicidal tendencies or aggression towards others were documented.\n\nUnder German law, which emphasizes privacy, it is the patient's responsibility to disclose their medical history to doctors assessing their fitness to fly. Roland Quast, medical director of Aeromedical Center Germany in Stuttgart, stated, \"What is decisive is that the pilot tells the truth. If he lies, we don't have lie detectors.\"\n\nThe revelation of Mr. Lubitz's medical history has sparked debate over the extent to which medical professionals should be allowed to disclose patient information to authorities when it could impact public safety. Parliamentary deputies from Germany's governing coalition have called for doctors to breach confidentiality when a patient shows signs of suicidal tendencies.\n\nKarl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat and medical expert, told the daily newspaper Bild that if lives could be endangered, \"the doctor has a duty to inform the employer about the unsuitability of the employee to do his work.\" He added, \"This applies especially in the case of psychiatric illness and the possible danger of suicide.\"\n\nHeinz Joachim Sch\u00f6ttes, a spokesman for Germanwings, declined to comment on the matter on Monday, citing the ongoing investigation. The debate over medical confidentiality and public safety continues to unfold as investigations into the Germanwings crash continue.",
    " Title: Congress Averts Government Shutdown and Debt Ceiling Crisis, Sets Stage for Future Budget Battles\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter two weeks of political gridlock and Republican infighting, Congress has passed a bill to end the first government shutdown in 17 years and to avert a default on U.S. debt. The bill, which was signed by President Barack Obama early Thursday morning, reopens the government and raises the debt ceiling.\n\nThe deal, brokered at the last minute by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, does little more than set up more budgetary battles. Government funding will run dry once again in January, and the borrowing limit must be lifted in February.\n\nFor now, the crisis that has gripped Washington is lifting. Government workers are being informed to return to work on Thursday, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is working to make the transition back to full operating status as smooth as possible.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner played a key role in the bill's passage, relying on House Democrats to carry the bill to passage, a clear violation of the Hastert Rule, a mantra that the House speaker should not bring legislation to the floor without the support of a \"majority of the majority\" of his members.\n\nThe Senate passed the bill with 81 senators voting yes, and 18 voting against the compromise negotiated by the chamber's leaders. The House then moved to clear the legislation 285-144, relying mostly on Democratic votes in the Republican-controlled chamber.\n\nThe bill does not alter Obamacare, a key demand of the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Instead, House Republicans were unable to get their members to rally around another plan to gut Obamacare as part of the government shutdown fight.\n\nThe Senate also agreed to a provision that House and Senate leaders would appoint negotiators to hash out a budget agreement by Dec. 13. This provision was objected to 21 times by Republicans earlier this year.\n\nThe legislation also includes a McConnell-written proposal that would allow Congress to disapprove of the debt-ceiling increase. Lawmakers will formally vote on rejecting the bump of the borrowing limit - if it passes, it could be vetoed by Obama. The deal would also deliver back pay to furloughed federal workers, require a study of income verification for people seeking health-insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and also allows the Treasury Department to use extraordinary measures to pay the nation's bills if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling in a timely fashion.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Strengthen Medicare, Aims to Reduce Regulations and Lower Drug Prices\n\nIn a bid to address the rising cost of healthcare and appease seniors, a key political constituency, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at strengthening the Medicare health program. The order, announced during a visit to a retirement community in Florida, is designed to reduce regulations, curb fraud, and provide faster access to new medical devices and therapies.\n\nThe executive order comes as a response to some Democratic proposals that aim for a broad and expensive expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans. Trump referred to such proposals as \"socialist\" and pledged to prevent them from becoming a reality, a move that is likely to be a significant talking point in his 2020 re-election campaign, where healthcare is expected to be a major issue.\n\nThe order encourages Medicare to utilize more medical telehealth services, which are care services delivered by phone or digital means, leading to cost reductions by reducing expensive emergency room visits. The order also directs the government to work towards allowing private insurers that operate Medicare Advantage plans to use new plan pricing methods, such as allowing beneficiaries to share in the savings when they choose lower-cost health services.\n\nThe order also aims to bring payments for the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program in line with payments for Medicare Advantage. Trump's plans contrast with the Medicare for All program promoted by Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist who is running to become the Democratic Party's nominee against Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSanders' proposal, backed by left-leaning Democrats but opposed by moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, would create a single-payer system, effectively eliminating private insurance by providing government coverage to everyone, using the Medicare model.\n\nThe White House is eager to show Trump making progress on healthcare, an issue Democrats successfully used to garner support and take control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump campaigned in 2016 on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, his predecessor President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law also known as \"Obamacare.\" So far, he has not repealed or replaced it.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it would propose a rule for imports of cheaper drugs from Canada into the United States. A formal rule has not yet been unveiled. The administration also issued an executive order in June demanding hospitals and insurers make prices they charge patients more transparent. Another executive order in July encouraged novel treatments for kidney disease.\n\nHowever, the administration's efforts to curtail drug prices and correct other perceived problems with the U.S. healthcare system have been met with mixed results. Policy experts suggest that the measures are unlikely to slow the tide of rising drug prices in a meaningful way. The White House is also facing legal challenges on some of its healthcare-related executive orders.",
    " Title: Divisions within the Republican Party Threaten Coherent Foreign Policy Approach Ahead of 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing squabbling among Republicans in Congress has hindered the adoption of legislation this summer aimed at enhancing the nation's technological defenses and protecting critical infrastructure from digital attacks. This internal discord, which has been a recurring theme since the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, has been evident in the recent debate over the Law of the Sea Treaty, similar to the 2010 debate over the New Start treaty that aimed to reduce Russian and American nuclear missile arsenals.\n\nHistorically, Republican divisions over foreign policy have been between realist and nationalist wings, with realism usually prevailing. However, the 2000s marked a significant shift, with President George W. Bush's administration introducing a new level of infighting that the party has yet to fully recover from. The neoconservative push for preventive war, as seen in the Iraq conflict, was countered by more pragmatic conservatives like Condoleezza Rice, who pulled the president back toward diplomacy.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential race, the Republican primary contest has exposed deep conservative disarray, with neoconservatives and neo-isolationists dominating the discourse, effectively sidelining pragmatic internationalists like James A. Baker III and Colin L. Powell.\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has dealt with these divisions in two ways. He has criticized President Obama's foreign policy, particularly on issues like Iran and Israel, but has offered few concrete alternatives. On the few matters where he has provided clear differences, he has adopted a confrontational approach, echoing the hard-line conservatives from the Bush years. For instance, he labeled Russia as the \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" of the United States and pledged to designate China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. His call for Republicans to block ratification of the New Start treaty put him at odds with all five living Republican former secretaries of state, including Condoleezza Rice.\n\nHowever, a combination of cheerleading and fiery rhetoric does not equate to a coherent and credible worldview. As the Republican nominee, Romney has an obligation to clarify his and his party's positions. It is crucial that he justifies his plan to add more than $2 trillion in defense spending over the next 10 years and explains how this aligns with his proposals to simultaneously cut taxes, reduce the debt, and strengthen America's economy.\n\nRomney should also address specific issues, such as his approach to Egypt, Syria, and Israel, where his positions are less clear. He needs to go beyond generalities to detail how he would strengthen military cooperation with Israel and provide a tactical approach to Syria, where the United States is already aiding the opposition.\n\nMitt Romney aims to convince Americans not only that he can revitalize the economy but also that he can lead effectively in a time of global uncertainty. To achieve this, he must first unite his party by offering clear alternatives to the president's policies. Vague criticisms of President Obama will not suffice.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Sheds 701,000 Jobs in March, Unemployment Rate Jumps to 4.4% Amid Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nThe U.S. economy experienced a significant setback in March, with the loss of 701,000 jobs, marking the first decline in payrolls since September 2010 and the steepest since the height of the Great Recession in March 2009. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from a half-century low of 3.5% in February.\n\nThe Labor Department's employment report, based on surveys conducted in the early weeks of March, does not fully reflect the depth of the economic calamity inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak. In the final two weeks of the month, 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits, a stark indication of the scale of the economic crash.\n\nRestaurants, bars, hotels, airlines, cruise lines, automakers, and entertainment venues have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, as a growing number of jurisdictions have ordered the closure of nonessential businesses and directed residents to stay at home.\n\nThe U.S. currently has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, with over 245,573 people infected, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 6,000 people in the country have died from the virus.\n\nEconomists' projections for unemployment vary significantly, but there is a broad consensus that it will be severe. An analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis last week projected that unemployment could reach 32% in the second quarter, with more than 47 million workers laid off due to the pandemic. This would surpass the 24.9% peak during the Great Depression.\n\n\"Much bigger job losses are coming,\" said Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, during a conference call with reporters earlier this week. He estimated that between 10 to 15 million jobs could be lost from the economy as a result of the outbreak, with the worst taking place in April.\n\nLawmakers are looking to provide relief to laid-off workers with a $2 trillion stimulus package, the largest relief bill in recent memory, which President Trump signed last week. The bill includes up to $1,200 cash checks for adults who earn less than $99,000 annually and expanded unemployment benefits.",
    " Title: CPAC 2022: A Reflection of the Republican Party's Internal Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this year has taken on a carnival-like atmosphere, with the presence of former President Donald Trump, a meaningless straw poll, and a plethora of fringe book merchants, making it more of a spectacle than a conservative gathering. This year's event, which begins outside Washington on Thursday, offers a clear reflection of the Republican Party four months after another presidential defeat.\n\nThe event, which has traditionally served as an early indicator of the state of conservatives, is emblematic of the GOP's current state of confusion. Establishment Republicans are displeased with the snubbing of popular GOP governors Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell, while conservatives are disgruntled with the inclusion of Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, perceived as representatives of the country club crowd.\n\nThe gathering will see the attendance of future Republican rising stars, but also figures from the past, many with headlines that are no longer welcome. A Republican gay group is not yet welcome, and hard-liners on immigration are also absent. The Paul family is poised to again win the presidential straw poll, to the frustration of organizers.\n\nFor decades, the Republican Party has grappled with its moderate-conservative divide. However, the confusion surrounding the party is now more complex than the enduring center vs. right paradigm. Former Mississippi Governor and Clinton-era Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour cautions, \"We all need to be singing from the same hymnal. When the other side has the megaphone of the White House, it makes it all the more important that your side sticks together on message and has more message discipline. We have to have moderate Republicans, conservative Republicans, neo-con Republicans, tea party people all saying, \u2018Here are the things we agree on and that we should emphasize.'\"\n\nAs CPAC gets underway, it's the differences that are coming into stark relief. The gathering has long been seen as an early indicator about the state of conservatives, and that's no different today. However, it's the GOP's identity crisis that's now being reflected by CPAC.\n\nThe pillars of the conservative era ushered in by Ronald Reagan - a muscular defense, traditional cultural values, and devotion to free markets - are being questioned by leading Republicans. What could take the place of Reagan's trinity is now being openly debated, with Republican leaders questioning interventionist foreign policy, urging a more tolerant stance on gay rights, and considering a more accommodating approach to abortion and the welfare state.\n\nRepublican leaders are questioning the interventionist foreign policy that President George W. Bush and the party's last two nominees paid obeisance to; party elites are urging a more tolerant or even supportive stance on gay rights and would be just fine if abortion wasn't discussed at all; and while conservative thinkers muse about a harder line on Wall Street, many GOP governors are bowing to the greatest expansion of the welfare state since the Great Society and their contemporaries in Congress, having just raised taxes at the start of the year, still entertain the possibility of more revenue increases in exchange for a fiscal grand bargain.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is considering a presidential bid in 2016, seeks to remake the GOP in his image, advocating for a more restrained foreign policy and a federalist approach on values issues. However, other party leaders, such as Barbour, hope to downplay differences and believe consensus is the only way to be relevant in the Obama era. Open internal warfare, this view goes, merely offers aid and comfort to the opposition. In other words, Republicans can't even agree on whether they should litigate their disagreements.",
    " Title: \"Remembering Staff Sgt. John H. McCarthy: A Life Cut Short in Vietnam\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Boston, Massachusetts, a small square bears the name of a fallen hero, Staff Sgt. John H. McCarthy. The intersection of Commonwealth Avenue and Colborne Road in the Allston-Brighton section of the city serves as a poignant reminder of the life and sacrifice of a young man who died in combat during the Vietnam War.\n\nStaff Sgt. McCarthy, who lived just up the street, never returned home after his second tour of duty. His brother, Richie McCarthy, recalls his big brother Jack as a patriot who loved his country and felt compelled to serve.\n\nGrowing up, the two brothers, born about two years apart, were close. They shared a talent for art, with Jack developing a particular fondness for painting. Richie remembers Jack as a perfectionist, often repainting his works to achieve the perfect stroke.\n\nBy 1960, Jack's interest in the military had taken hold, and on his 17th birthday, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. His childhood friend, Dan Daley, describes Jack as a tall, handsome, and muscular young man who was a natural fit for the Marines.\n\nIn the Marine Corps, Jack thrived. He was chosen for a training exercise observed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 and was assigned to a ship during the Cuban Missile Crisis. His first deployment to Vietnam came in 1965, where he worked with local South Vietnamese villagers and rooting out the Viet Cong.\n\nIn a letter home in November 1965, Jack wrote, \"Dear Mom, I will really miss some of the people in this village... We have had a few more brushes with the V.C. in our area but we are getting smarter than them because we have been killing them.\"\n\nAfter 13 months in Vietnam, Jack returned stateside. However, by late 1967, he was called back to Vietnam for a second tour. Richie remembers their conversations before Jack left, with his brother expressing concerns about the dangers ahead.\n\nTragically, on the morning of Feb. 18, 1968, Jack stepped on an enemy explosive device and was severely wounded. He was evacuated to a Naval field hospital in Danang and was able to send some letters home before his condition worsened.\n\n\"Dear Mom, Sorry not to have written before but I'm feeling better now and am going to be okay. I'm lucky it wasn't any worse, but I've lost my right leg, and the sight of my right eye. Don't worry about it. Please,\" read one of the letters.\n\nDespite the efforts of surgeons, Jack died on the morning of March 25, 1968, at the age of 24. His brother, Dan Daley, reflects on the loss, \"When I think of him, I just think what a shame it is he could not really live his life.\"\n\n\"You know, when I'd see his name on the wall like I was in D.C. recently, that's all I think of, what a shame, poor kid, he was so young. He never really had children or he didn't really have a life, he was just starting out, and snuffed out. It was sad, he had a lot of potential, it just wasn't realized,\" Daley says.\n\nStaff Sgt. John H. McCarthy's story serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by America's troops and their families during the Vietnam War. His name, etched in stone on a small sign in a Boston square, stands as a testament to his life and the lives of countless others who gave their all in service to their country.",

Ilhan Omar and \"The Squad\" over the Minnesota congresswoman's controversial remarks about the attacks.\n\nDuring a reading of victims' names, Haros Jr., who was wearing a shirt with Omar's words, spoke out against the congresswoman's infamous comment earlier this year in which she described the 9/11 attacks as \"some people did something.\"\n\n\"Today I am here to respond to you exactly who did what to whom,\" Haros Jr. said, standing just steps away from the site of the former World Trade Center's south tower. \"Madam, objectively speaking, we know who and what was done. There is no uncertainty about that. Why your confusion?\"\n\nHaros Jr. went on to explain that 19 Islamic terrorists, members of Al Qaeda, killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. He emphasized that his mother, a tireless receptionist at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, was among the victims who lost their lives on that fateful day.\n\n\"But as to whom? I was attacked. Your relatives and friends were attacked,\" Haros Jr. said, looking out to the crowd. \"Our constitutional freedoms were attacked and our nation's founding on Judeo-Christian principles was attacked.\"\n\nOmar tweeted about the attacks on Wednesday, though it was unclear if her tweet was in response to Haros Jr.'s words. \"September 11th was an attack on all of us,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget the thousands of Americans who lost their lives in the largest terror attack on U.S. soil. I will continue to fight to make sure we care for the first responders and families who lost loved ones.\"\n\nThe \"some people did something\" comment from Omar that drew widespread criticism was made at a March 23 fundraiser for the controversial Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley, the other three members of \"The Squad,\" sprang to Omar's defense, with Tlaib telling MSNBC that Omar's words were taken out of context.\n\nHaros Jr. has previously called out politicians at Ground Zero on the anniversary of the attacks, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\n\"Stop. Stop, please stop using the bones and ashes of our loved ones as props in your political theater,\" Haros Jr. declared. \"Their lives, sacrifices, and death are worth so much more.\"",
    " Title: Job Growth in July Exceeds Expectations, Unemployment Rate Ticks Up Slightly\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 163,000 jobs in July, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday. The job growth surpassed most analysts' expectations, with many predicting around 100,000 new jobs. However, the unemployment rate ticked up slightly from 8.2% to 8.3%.\n\nThe better-than-expected jobs figure provides some relief for President Barack Obama as he campaigns for re-election in November. The high unemployment numbers have been a point of contention between the Obama administration and the Republican party.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized the job growth, stating, \"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families. President Obama doesn't have a plan and believes that the private sector is 'doing fine.' Obviously, that is not the case.\"\n\nThe average job growth in 2012 is 151,000 jobs per month, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2011, the figure was 153,000.\n\nThe White House used the positive jobs report to argue that the employment picture is improving, even if it is not good enough. President Obama said, \"We haven't had to come back from an economic crisis this deep or this painful since the 1930s. We are not going to get there, we're not going get to where we need to be if we go back to the policies that helped to create this mess in the first place.\"\n\nEconomist Jared Bernstein, who worked for the Obama administration earlier in the president's term, cautioned against reading too much into a single month's data. \"Keep your powder dry on this one,\" he said in a blog post. \"There are lots of other economic headwinds out there, not least of which is a GDP growth rate below trend, and that's usually associated with weaker job growth numbers than we saw from the payroll report.\"\n\nInvestors reacted positively to the jobs report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shooting up close to 250 points by the afternoon. Analysts do not expect the economic outlook to change dramatically before the November elections. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, stated, \"The concerns about recession are misplaced.\"",
    " Title: Kasich Disagrees with Democrats' Proposal to Link Terror Watch List and Gun Purchases, Emphasizes Intelligence Gap\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Republican presidential candidate John Kasich expressed disagreement with the Democratic proposal to link individuals on the terrorism watch list with a \"no-gun\" list, citing potential complications in monitoring potential terrorists.\n\nDuring the interview with Jake Tapper, Kasich emphasized the importance of maintaining discretion when gathering intelligence about potential terrorist activities. He argued that alerting individuals under review could compromise ongoing investigations.\n\nWhen Tapper presented a hypothetical scenario involving someone on the terrorism watch list purchasing firearms, Kasich stressed the need for caution and a common-sense approach to this complex issue.\n\nPresident Obama, in response to the San Bernardino shooting, has advocated for preventing individuals on a \"no-fly\" or terrorism watch list from purchasing firearms. He stated, \"We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but \u2014 at a bare minimum \u2014 we shouldn't be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans.\"\n\nMany Democrats have supported Obama's call, while many Republicans have opposed it as an infringement on civil liberties. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, acknowledged that if someone is on a no-fly list, \"we could probably keep them from getting guns.\"\n\nHowever, Kasich highlighted the intelligence community's inability to read encrypted messages as a significant issue in preventing terrorist acts. He pointed out that authorities were unable to decipher the encrypted messages exchanged among the terrorists involved in last month's Paris attacks that left 130 people dead.\n\nKasich urged Congress to prioritize ensuring that authorities have access to such messages to prevent future tragedies. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach that respects civil liberties while ensuring national security.",
    " Title: Exclusive Interview: Gary Johnson's Immigration Policies and Fiscal Conservatism in the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive, extended interview this week, Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson discussed his immigration policies, fiscal conservatism, and other key issues in the 2016 presidential race. Johnson, a former two-term Republican Governor of New Mexico, currently enjoys around eight percent support in national polling, but is yet to meet the threshold of 15 percent to qualify for the fall debates.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues in the 2016 election cycle has been immigration, with both major party nominees, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, proposing controversial stances and policies. Johnson, as a border state governor, shared his views on immigration, and addressed his previous support for President Obama's executive amnesty.\n\nWhen asked about his stance on the term \"illegal immigrant,\" Johnson objected, calling it \"incendiary\" and offensive. He instead advocated for a more inclusive approach to immigration, emphasizing the need for a humane and practical solution.\n\nJohnson described his ticket's outlook as \"fiscally conservative and socially inclusive,\" and highlighted his and his running mate's support for free trade. He criticized both Clinton and Trump for their ethically compromised and dishonest approaches to government, respectively. Johnson also pointed to his record of reducing the growth of government as governor, earning re-election in a blue state despite his reputation as a \"penny pincher.\"\n\nLater this week, we will reveal Johnson's thoughts on issues such as the Second Amendment, Obamacare, the Iran deal, and the Hobby Lobby decision.

Kavanaugh as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court this weekend, marking the end of a contentious confirmation process that left many lawmakers expressing concern about the future of such proceedings. The confirmation came amid allegations of sexual misconduct and a highly charged political environment that has left all sides fearful about the next time they are tasked with confirming a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nRepublican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, hailed the confirmation as a turning point, signaling that the acrimony of the past few months was not a successful strategy for Democrats trying to derail a nominee whose legal credentials were widely regarded as stellar. McConnell stated, \"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today is a vote to end this brief, dark chapter in the Senate's history and turn the page toward a brighter tomorrow.\"\n\nDespite the slim majority, Republican leadership managed to shepherd Justice Kavanaugh through the Senate in a hostile media environment and with the upcoming midterm elections. Shortly after the vote, President Trump signed Justice Kavanaugh's commission, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath of office, restoring the court to its full contingent of nine justices.\n\nDemocrats expressed disappointment over the confirmation, citing broken traditions regarding access to documents and the nature of background checks. They also criticized the FBI's failure to corroborate the 36-year-old accusations of sexual assault and took issue with Justice Kavanaugh's testy testimony during the confirmation hearings.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, accused Democrats of fabricating erroneous stories about Justice Kavanaugh's judicial record, concocting conspiracy theories, and maltreating Christine Blasey Ford, the first accuser to come forward privately, only to see her allegations leaked.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat with more than two decades in the Senate, acknowledged that both parties shared blame for the acrimony, with Republicans escalating matters. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, cautioned his party against using the same tactics if a Democratic president makes a nomination in the future.\n\nThe confirmation process has a history of partisan politics, with each party setting new lows in their efforts to confirm or block nominees. Republicans followed the lead of former Sen. Joseph R. Biden when they refused to consider President Obama's 2016 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, holding the seat open for the next president to fill. Similarly, Democrats have employed the filibuster and the \"nuclear option\" to change the interpretation of the rules and defang the filibuster for most judicial nominees.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer was noncommittal when asked last week whether he would try to reverse the change and restore the filibuster's power for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats regain control of the chamber. Despite the partisan divide, there were signs of bipartisan cooperation, as evidenced by the Senate's approval of two massive spending bills, an anti-opioid package, and progress on other bipartisan priorities.\n\nIn the aftermath of the contentious confirmation process, the relationships between senators, built up over decades, remain strong, as demonstrated by the exchange of handshakes and chuckles between Sen. Richard J. Durbin and Sen. Chuck Grassley, despite their differences during the Kavanaugh nomination process.",
    " Title: \"Rumors of ObamaCare Bailout for Health Insurers Persist as Costs Rise and Taxpayer Funding Remains a Possibility\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the costs of ObamaCare continue to rise, the possibility of a taxpayer-funded bailout for health insurance companies looms large. With insurers passing on increased costs to patients in the form of higher premiums and deductibles, there is growing urgency for Congress to address this issue and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to cover insurers' losses under ObamaCare.\n\nThis week, a majority of insurers offering health plans in Florida announced rate increases ranging from 11 to 23 percent. If patients choose to drop their coverage due to these sharp increases, the health insurers will need to make up the difference.\n\nEnter section 1342 of the ObamaCare law, which established so-called \"risk corridors.\" According to this provision, taxpayers would make up the difference for health insurance companies whose plans lose money under ObamaCare. In November, legislation was introduced to repeal this section and protect taxpayers from being forced to cover insurers' ObamaCare losses.\n\nHowever, as pressure from taxpayers mounted on the Obama administration, it announced that it had no intention of operating this bailout program at a net cost to the American people. This announcement was met with resistance from health insurers and their lobbyists. In response, new legislation was introduced to codify the administration's promise and prohibit the use of taxpayer funds for this \"revenue neutrality.\"\n\nDespite this legislation going nowhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate, the White House has shown no interest in moving forward with it. In recent weeks, it has been revealed that senior White House officials have been working closely with insurers behind the scenes to ensure that the earlier bailout deal, which helped secure ObamaCare's passage in 2010, would remain in place.\n\nAccording to a recent investigation conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, insurers widely expect to receive funds from the bailout program. One large health insurer recently filed financial statements claiming they expect part of their revenue to come from American taxpayers via the ObamaCare bailout \"fund.\"\n\nThe \"fund\" brings us to another dimension of the Obama administration's maneuvering to ensure that health insurers receive payment. Knowing that the current U.S. House of Representatives will never appropriate money for this bailout, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has found a way to use general funds available through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to pay off health insurers. This circumvents Congress' power of the purse for the purpose of bailing out health insurers with taxpayer funds.\n\nWith ObamaCare's costs rising and projected to cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, its damage on people's jobs and work hours continuing, and the prospect of a taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurers still alive and well, it's clear that this law has failed. It's time for Congress to take action to repeal and replace ObamaCare, but at the very least, we should make it the law of the land that health insurers will not be bailed out by taxpayers because ObamaCare has not proven to be as profitable as its proponents hoped it would be.",
    " Title: Former FBI Lawyer Lisa Page Breaks Silence, Speaks Out Against President Trump's Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a rare interview, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who gained national attention for her text messages with fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, has spoken out against President Donald Trump's persistent attacks on her. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Page, 39, expressed her frustration over the president's repeated attacks, particularly a mocking incident at an Oct. 11 rally in Minneapolis that she described as a \"demeaning fake orgasm.\"\n\n\"I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,\" she said. \"It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.\"\n\nPage, who left the FBI in May 2018, said the mocking incident was the \"straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\" She tweeted on Sunday night, \"I\u2019m done being quiet.\"\n\nPage said the attacks by Trump were \"like being punched in the gut.\" She described the feeling as \"sickening\" and \"intimidating\" due to the president's power and the potential for further damage to her life and career.\n\nTrump last tweeted about Page on Nov. 15, criticizing the fact that his longtime associate Roger Stone was headed to jail while Page, Strzok, and others, including his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, went free.\n\nInvestigations have not shown Page, Strzok, Clinton, or any of the others accused by Trump to be guilty of any criminal wrongdoing. In a June 2018 report, the Justice Department inspector general's office said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the anti-Trump texts between Page and Strzok but did not find evidence to connect the political views expressed in these messages to the specific investigative decisions they made in the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nA new report from the Justice Department inspector general on the origin of the investigations into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election is scheduled for release on Dec. 9. Page can expect her name to appear in that report as well.\n\nPage said that even if the inspector general's report clears her of any wrongdoing, she does not expect her vilification among Trump's supporters to end. She told The Daily Beast, \"While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don\u2019t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people.\"\n\nIn their texts, Page and Strzok made several comments that were disparaging of Trump and supportive of Clinton. In the text exchange most often cited as evidence of their bias against Trump, Page asks Strzok to assure her that Trump is \"not ever going to become president, right?\"\n\nPage said she had been inaccurately depicted by a \"cherry-picked selection of my texts\" and did not remember the messages about Trump when she first learned her texts were being investigated.\n\nSeveral Trump supporters were appalled by the interview, and they decried what they saw as Page's attempt to paint herself as a victim. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted, \"Let me get this straight, Page and Strzok sent texts about an 'insurance policy' and how they\u2019ll'stop Trump' while part of the FBI spying on Trump campaign. Now Lisa Page is blaming the President. 1 week before Horowitz\u2019s FISA report.\"\n\nPage's marriage survived, but she compared the effect of the experience to post-traumatic stress disorder, saying it is worse \"because it's not over. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a historical event that is being relived. It just keeps happening.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t ever know when the president\u2019s going to attack next,\" she said. \"And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day. You don\u2019t really get used to it.\"",
    " Title: Trump Dismisses Moore Allegations Amid Asia Trip, Stays Firm on Support\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, currently in Hanoi for a state banquet and meetings with Vietnam's president and prime minister, has chosen to distance himself from the growing controversy surrounding Senate candidate Roy Moore. In an interview on Air Force One, Trump stated that he has been too engrossed in his Asia trip to focus on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore, but reiterated his previous White House statement that Moore will \"do the right thing.\"\n\nThe controversy arose after five women came forward to the Washington Post, claiming that Moore had acted inappropriately towards them in the 1970s, including sexual contact with a 14-year-old in 1979, when Moore was a 32-year-old prosecutor. Moore, in an interview with Fox News on Friday, gave vague denials of the allegations, stating, \"I don\u2019t remember anything like that.\"\n\nTrump had initially supported Moore after the primary, but other prominent Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have since withdrawn their support. When asked about the specifics of the allegations against Moore on Saturday, Trump emphasized his focus on international affairs.\n\n\"Honestly, I\u2019d have to look at it and I\u2019d have to see. Because, again, I\u2019m dealing with the president of China, the president of Russia. I\u2019m dealing with the folks over here,\" Trump said. \"I haven\u2019t been able to devote very much time to it.\"\n\nThe allegations against Moore have been met with skepticism in Alabama, with some residents questioning the timing and credibility of the accusers. However, the controversy continues to grow, and it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold in the Alabama Senate race.",
    " Title: Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Infections and Deaths in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 reveals a disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on Black Americans, with Black people accounting for a larger share of infections and deaths compared to their representation in the general population.\n\nIn 28 states and the District of Columbia, preliminary data analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 shows that Black people make up a larger share of coronavirus infections than they do of the general population. In 18 of these areas, Black people also account for a disproportionately large share of coronavirus fatalities.\n\nFor instance, in Michigan, Black people are 14 percent of the state's population but 33 percent of its coronavirus cases and 40 percent of its deaths. Similarly, in Wisconsin, Black people are six percent of the state's population but 25 percent of its coronavirus cases and 39 percent of its deaths.\n\nData for Latinx populations is scarce, but available data shows that Latinx people are dying at much higher rates in New York City relative to their share of the population, but not in other areas that provided relevant breakdowns.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released racial data on 10 states, but civil rights groups, medical professionals, and lawmakers are pressing for more comprehensive data on who is infected and who dies from the coronavirus by race and ethnicity.\n\nThomas LaVeist, dean of the Tulane School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine, attributes the racial disparities to a variety of factors, including the higher likelihood of Black Americans working essential jobs, living in densely populated, historically segregated cities, and suffering disproportionately from underlying health conditions.\n\nClyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, calls the disparities a \"moment of ethical reckoning\" and points out that infection rates were three times higher in counties with mostly Black people than in predominantly white counties. Predominantly Black counties also saw a sixfold higher death rate than mostly white counties.\n\nYancy writes, \"A 6-fold increase in the rate of death for African Americans due to a now ubiquitous virus should be deemed unconscionable.\" He warns that while the scourge of COVID-19 will end, health care disparities will persist.\n\nThe full data analysis by \u2588\u2588\u2588 can be found on their website.

    " Title: The Unprecedented Call for Trump's Resignation Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has become a global hotspot, accounting for one-third of all global cases and one-quarter of the fatalities. The catastrophic handling of the crisis can be largely attributed to the actions and inactions of President Donald Trump.\n\nThis article is not a political statement, but a factual account of the events that have transpired since the onset of the pandemic. The focus is on the president's role in the crisis, and the call for his immediate resignation due to his mishandling of the situation.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Trump's response has been his promotion of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Despite the drug not being approved by the FDA for this purpose, Trump encouraged its use, leading to potentially life-threatening consequences. A case in point is a couple in Arizona who took a related drug, resulting in the husband's death and the wife's hospitalization. A new study of Veterans Health Administration patients has concluded that COVID-19 patients who take hydroxychloroquine are more likely to die than those who do not.\n\nTrump's suggestions extended beyond hydroxychloroquine when he proposed the use of ultraviolet rays and disinfectants as potential treatments for the virus, suggesting they could be injected into the body. These comments prompted public health experts and companies like Lysol to remind the public that such substances should not be ingested.\n\nThe Trump administration's handling of the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus has also been questionable. Reports suggest that the official in charge of the federal agency responsible for the vaccine's development was forced out after raising concerns about funds being directed towards hydroxychloroquine.\n\nTrump's actions have not been limited to the medical front. He has also encouraged protests against social distancing orders, contradicting the White House's own guidance. His obsession with reopening the economy has reportedly led governors in red states to weaken social distancing regulations.\n\nTrump's credibility has been significantly damaged, with less than a quarter of voters trusting his statements about COVID-19. The call for his resignation is not a partisan exercise, but a plea for accountability and a reminder that even in the wreckage of the Trump era, some basic political norms still matter.\n\nThe demand for Trump's resignation is not a futile plea for political sanity, but a common-sense response to a president who is detached from reality, indifferent to the suffering around us, and more concerned about his political standing than the health and well-being of the American people.\n\nMichael A.

    " Title: Justice Department and FBI Reveal Al Qaeda Connection in Pensacola Military Base Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The Saudi military trainee who carried out a terror attack at a military base in Pensacola, Florida, last year, killing three US sailors and wounding several others, was a longtime associate of al Qaeda who had communicated with operatives from the group as recently as the night before the shooting, the Justice Department and the FBI announced Monday.\n\nUS investigators uncovered the al Qaeda connection after the FBI broke through the encryption protecting the Saudi attacker's iPhones and have been able to use the information on the devices to carry out a recent counterterrorism operation in Yemen, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a news conference.\n\n\"The evidence we've been able to develop from the killer's devices shows that the Pensacola attack was actually the brutal culmination of years of planning and preparation by a longtime AQAP associate,\" Wray said, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the deadliest branches of the terror group.\n\nMohammed Alshamrani, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force who had been training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, was killed by law enforcement during the attack.\n\nThe officials stopped short of saying that Alshamrani had been directed by the terror group, but said his ties to the AQAP began as far back as 2015 and were \"significant.\"\n\nThe connection between the group and the attack marked a major development in the US fight against terrorism: since 9/11, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully directed a deadly attack in the US, according to New America, a think tank.\n\nThe officials also used the opportunity to hammer Apple for refusing to help investigators break into the devices. Wray said that the FBI received \"effectively no help\" from Apple in bypassing the phones and that third-party technology firms were also unable to help investigators.\n\n\"The fix that the FBI was able to develop for Alshamrani's phones 'is not a fix for our broader Apple problem,'\" Wray said, calling it a \"pretty limited application.\"\n\nBarr called it a \"great disappointment\" that Apple had refused to help investigators.\n\n\"Apple has made a business and marketing decision to design its phones in a way that only the user can unlock the contents no matter what the circumstances. In cases like this, where the user is a terrorist, or in other cases where the user is a violent criminal, a human trafficker, a child predator, Apple's decision has dangerous consequences for the public safety and the national security and is in my judgment unacceptable,\" Barr said.\n\nAlshamrani was \"meticulous\" in his planning, Wray said, and had been coordinating \"planning and tactics\" with the operatives ahead of the attack. Alshamrani also wrote a \"final will purporting to explain himself\" that he had saved on his phone. The will was later released by AQAP when they claimed credit for the attack, Wray said.\n\n\"We now have a picture of him we did not have before we obtained this evidence,\" Wray said.\n\nApple said in a statement Monday that the company does not believe in creating special access to its devices for the government because of security concerns.\n\n\"It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor \u2014 one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers,\" the company said.\n\n\"There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys, and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has previously called the attack an act of terrorism that was motivated by \"jihadist ideology.\" Alshamrani had made anti-American, anti-Israel, and jihadi posts on social media -- including one on the September 11 anniversary -- that stated \"the countdown has begun,\" and another two hours before the attack that referenced the words of an al Qaeda cleric.\n\nDuring a 15-minute shooting spree, Alshamrani shot at a photo of President Donald Trump as well as a former president. He made statements during the attack that were critical of American servicemen overseas, the FBI has said.\n\nAQAP had claimed responsibility for the Pensacola attack and said it was in touch with Alshamrani. In February, the White House announced that Qassim al-Rimi, the leader of the group, had been killed in an airstrike in Yemen.\n\nBarr would not say whether the second counterterrorism operation that targeted one of the AQAP associates that the shooter had talked with had killed the suspected terrorist in Yemen, though he said he was \"very pleased\" with the operation's results.\n\nNo other co-conspirators have been charged in the shooting, and Barr said earlier this year that investigators did not find evidence that any of the shooter's friends or fellow trainees from Saudi Arabia had advance knowledge that he was going to attack the base.\n\nOn Monday, Barr said the Saudi government continued to fully cooperate with the investigation, and the Saudi Embassy in Washington said in a statement Monday evening they are providing \"full support to our American counterparts.\"\n\n\"The Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its sincerest condolences to the American people on the tragedy that unfolded in December at Pensacola, Florida, and welcomes the announcement by US law authorities of the recovery of critical intelligence from the assailant's telephones,\" the statement said.\n\nInvestigators had initially been unable to retrieve data stored on two iPhones belonging to the shooter, and they cited that hurdle in trying to complete their investigation of the attacker's ideology and radicalization. Justice Department and FBI officials said Apple had helped provide access to iCloud and other data from the shooter's devices, but breaking the phones' encryption was key to retrieving more of Alshamrani's communications before the attack.\n\nA number of lethal terror attacks in the US have been inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, although none have been successfully directed by the groups since the 9/11 attacks, which left nearly 3,000 people dead, according to a 2019 study by New America.\n\nAl Qaeda thrived for years after 9/11, conducting deadly terror attacks in Europe and across the Middle East, but it was largely hollowed out under the Obama administration, which waged a campaign against the group's core in Pakistan. Trump announced last September that Hamza bin Laden, the son of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, had been \"killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Faces Tough Decision on Syria Strikes as Obama Seeks Authorization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense hearing at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry urged members of Congress to authorize retaliatory strikes against Syria, warning that failure to act could lead to the use of chemical weapons by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad or by other nations such as North Korea or Iran.\n\nThe White House is seeking authorization for military action in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government on August 21. The administration's request has sparked a heated debate in Congress, with many lawmakers expressing skepticism and opposition to the proposed resolution.\n\nDuring the hearing, Secretary Kerry emphasized that there is no doubt that troops loyal to President Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in rebel-held territory on August 21, and that the only question now is whether the U.S. will enforce President Obama's and the world's \"red line.\"\n\nThe administration's request for authorization has faced resistance from both sides of the aisle, with some lawmakers expressing concern that limited U.S. strikes could lead to a regional escalation. Others have questioned the intelligence supporting the administration's claims that chemical weapons were used.\n\nIn a significant development, House Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, emerged from a meeting with President Obama to say he will vote to authorize an attack on Syria. However, it remains unclear whether Mr. Boehner will be able to bring other lawmakers on board, as more and more rank-and-file members are adding their names to the list of those opposed to the authority Mr. Obama is seeking.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set to vote on a resolution Wednesday that would prohibit \"combat\" troops from being deployed to Syria and would give the president just 90 days to conduct his strikes. The resolution, which was agreed upon by the top members of the committee, restricts the scope of action in Syria and presses the administration to look into arming moderate rebels fighting to overthrow President Assad.\n\nThe administration is hoping that the resolution will begin to build momentum for eventual approval by both chambers of Congress. However, it remains to be seen whether the resolution will be narrow enough to win over undecided lawmakers and whether the administration will be able to find the necessary votes to authorize military action.\n\nIn his testimony, Secretary Kerry compared those who would vote against action to the case of the MS St. Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Germany that was turned away from Cuba, the U.S. and Canada in 1939, and had to return to Europe, where many of its passengers eventually died in Nazi camps.\n\nThe Senate committee hearing was interrupted several times by vocal female protesters calling for Congress to reject any military action. Secretary Kerry, who made a name in national politics by protesting the Vietnam War, in which he served, said he sympathized with the demonstrating women and that it represented the importance for Congress to have a debate.\n\nThe administration is set to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, while the Senate committee will hold a closed-door session to hear classified details about U.S. plans and about the intelligence supporting claims that chemical weapons were used.",
    " Title: White House Warns of Severe Consequences of Sequestration as Automatic Cuts Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of an impending blizzard in New England, the White House has turned its attention to another storm brewing in Washington D.C. - the potential impact of sequestration, the automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense and domestic spending set to take effect on March 1st unless Congress and President Obama reach a compromise.\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters on Friday, White House officials painted a grim picture of the effects of sequestration, using a series of adjectives such as \"large and arbitrary,\" \"severe,\" \"significant and harmful,\" \"very significant,\" \"blunt,\" \"mindless,\" and \"extraordinarily troublesome.\"\n\nThe officials outlined specific consequences that Americans might not appreciate, including the potential removal of 70,000 young children from Head Start early education programs, the furloughing of hundreds of federal prosecutors, reduced food safety inspections, the loss of nutritional benefits for 600,000 women and children, and a decrease in small-business loans by about $500 million.\n\n\"The cuts would cause very significant disruptions that would be felt far and wide across the country,\" said Danny Werfel, the federal controller of the Office of Management and Budget. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg. We can't plan our way out of these consequences or take steps to soften the blow.\"\n\nThe briefing was the latest effort by President Obama's White House to ensure that Republicans take the blame for the consequences of the automatic cuts, should they occur. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, attempted to deflect that blame, noting that the House has already proposed alternative spending cuts to avoid the automatic ones.\n\nIn a statement emailed to reporters, Mr. Buck said, \"The president is out of excuses. We're glad they're laying out the devastating consequences of the president's sequester, but the question remains: what are they willing to do to prevent it?\"\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell's office responded to the White House briefing with a tweet, stating, \"Words not used at WH briefing to describe sequestered budget cuts: 'Here's our plan.'\"\n\nAt the White House, economic officials lamented the lack of flexibility in the sequestration law, which they noted was intentional. \"It was intended to drive Democrats and Republicans in Congress to compromise,\" Mr. Werfel said. \"It does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction.\"\n\nWhite House officials are quick to point out that Republicans in the House initially embraced the idea of the automatic cuts as a means to enforce deficit discipline. They point out that 174 House Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, voted for sequestration, with Mr. Boehner himself proclaiming himself pleased when it passed.\n\nJay Carney, the president's press secretary, said the notion that the automatic cuts were solely the president's idea is a \"fanciful confection\" invented by Republicans. However, none of Mr. Obama's aides were willing to admit that the president regretted signing the law that put the sequestration plan into effect. Mr. Carney explained that because of Republican opposition to tax increases, the automatic cuts became the only way to avoid a default on the national debt in the summer of 2011.\n\n\"He could not let the country default for the first time, thus the sequester,\" Mr. Carney said. \"The whole point in its design was that it would never come to pass.\"",

In a statement, Mr. Holder expressed confidence in their abilities to \"doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice where it leads.\"\n\nThe attorney general made it clear that the appointed U.S. attorneys are fully authorized to prosecute criminal violations resulting from their investigation, consult with members of the intelligence community, and follow investigative leads regardless of their origin. Mr. Holder has notified members of Congress and plans to brief members of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees \"as appropriate.\"\n\nPresident Obama defended himself from criticism regarding a series of national security leaks, most recently a report in the New York Times about U.S. cyber attacks on Iranian computers that run its nuclear enrichment facilities. During a press conference, Mr. Obama denied the leaks were intentional and orchestrated to boost his foreign policy credentials ahead of the November election.\n\nCritics, led by Sen. John McCain, have labeled the leaks a serious security breach and unprecedented in recent memory. Mr. McCain accuses the Obama administration of leaking the information to bolster Mr. Obama's reputation as a hands-on, decisive leader.\n\nIn response, Mr. Obama called his critics out, stating they \"need to have a better sense of how I approach this office and how the people around me here approach this office.\" He emphasized that his administration has a \"zero tolerance\" policy for such leaks and pledged to launch a thorough investigation into the matter.\n\nFriday afternoon, Mr. Holder announced the appointment of the two U.S. attorneys, emphasizing that his administration has mechanisms in place to \"root out folks who have leaked, and they will suffer consequences.\" He added that in some cases, these actions are criminal, and thorough investigations will be conducted, as in the past.",
    " Title: Trump's Presidency: A Divisive Battlefield or Unifying Force?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has been hailed as a unifier, not just within the Republican Party, but also among Democrats, as the nation prepares for the upcoming November elections. According to a Gallup Poll, 94% of Republicans approve of Trump's handling of his presidency, a level of support that rivals only the first months of the 1991 Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush and the initial months of the 2003 Iraq War under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe State of the Union address and the post-acquittal gathering in the East Room saw an unprecedented display of home-team enthusiasm from Republicans, a level of support that has not been seen before for a Republican president. Similarly, working- and middle-class voters have shown unparalleled support for Trump at his mammoth rallies. This unity among Republicans is a striking contrast to the party's usual divisions.\n\nHowever, the unity within the Republican Party is not the only notable aspect of Trump's presidency. The Democratic Party has also been united in their opposition to Trump, with only three Democrats in the House voting against his impeachment and removal. In the Senate, every Democrat voted to convict and expel Trump from office and prevent his ever running again.\n\nThe impeachment and removal trial, the battle over the Supreme Court nominations, and the contentious issues of healthcare, immigration, and abortion have all served as battlegrounds, reflecting deep-seated ideological differences between the two parties. The question remains, is Trump the cause of the uncivil war in America, or is his presidency merely the battlefield upon which America's cultural and political war is currently engaged?\n\nThe ideological differences between the two parties are stark. For instance, Bernie Sanders' nationalization of health care and abolition of private health insurance for 150 million Americans is grounded in a socialism that is incompatible with Trump's belief in the superiority of the private sector. Similarly, Democrats' unanimous support for \"reproductive rights\" is in eternal conflict with Trump's pledge to nominate justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe battle over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination is a recent example of the ideological divide, but the battles over the Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas predated it by decades. The issue of immigration, with Democrats advocating for open borders and Republicans for stricter immigration policies, is another contentious issue.\n\nThe question of whether Trump is responsible for the irrationality and irresponsibility taking hold of the Democratic Party is a topic of debate. Some argue that Trump's success has maddened Democrats into manifesting who they are and what they believe. Others contend that Trump's presidency has simply brought to the surface the deep-seated ideological differences that have always existed within the American political landscape.\n\nAs the nation heads towards the November elections, the question remains: will the unity within the Republican Party and the ideological differences between the two parties lead to a more divided America, or will it serve as a catalyst for meaningful change and a more unified nation? Only time will tell.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Plans for a \"Space Force,\" Emphasizes Space as a National Security Priority\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Donald Trump on Monday called for the establishment of a new military branch, the \"Space Force,\" during a meeting of the National Space Council. The proposed force would be the sixth branch of the U.S. armed forces, separate but equal to the Air Force.\n\nSpeaking in Washington D.C., Trump stated, \"We are going to have a space force. An Air Force and a Space Force. Separate, but equal.\" This is not the first time the idea of a \"space force\" has been proposed by the president; he mentioned it in May during a ceremony at the White House.\n\nThe president did not provide specific details about the military role of the \"space force\" or its command structure. However, he framed space as a national security issue, expressing concern about China, Russia, and other countries leading in space.\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Dana White responded, \"We understand the President's guidance. Our Policy Board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines, and Navy. Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\"\n\nThe president also emphasized the need for a long-term presence in space, expressed support for the nascent commercial space travel industry, and signed a directive to manage space traffic. The directive aims to provide a safe and secure environment in orbit as satellite traffic increases and sets new guidelines for satellite design and operation to avoid collisions and spacecraft breakups.\n\nThe meeting also saw Trump's call for a build-up in the long-term presence in space, as well as his support for the U.S. space program's goal of returning to the moon and eventually reaching Mars.\n\nBefore addressing the space program, President Trump weighed in on the ongoing immigration crisis, criticizing the U.S.'s current immigration laws and blaming the Democrats for the crisis. He stated, \"The United States will not be a migrant holding facility. We cannot allow that to happen in the U.S. Not on my watch. We want safety and we want security.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents has come under increasing scrutiny from both sides of the aisle. The policy, which has resulted in nearly 2,000 minors being separated from their families over six weeks, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and even a number of influential Republicans, including former first lady Laura Bush, who called the policy \"cruel\" and \"immoral\" in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.",
    " Title: Gallup and Rasmussen Polls Show Tight Presidential Race Between Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest Gallup and Rasmussen polls have shown a tight race between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, with a single-digit lead for either candidate. The Gallup poll, which surveys registered voters over a seven-day cycle, has Obama leading by a single point, while Rasmussen, which tracks likely voters on a three-day cycle, shows Romney with a two-point lead.\n\nFollowing the Democratic National Convention, Obama had led by as many as five points in Rasmussen and seven points in Gallup. The lead was largely attributed to an effective speech from former President Bill Clinton. However, the post-Republican National Convention bounce has been erased by Rasmussen, and the race has returned to its pre-convention dynamic.\n\nIn the battleground states, Romney has pulled into a virtual tie with Obama in New Hampshire, with a lead of 46% to 45%. The good news for the Republicans is that a likely voter screen would probably boost Romney a little bit. The bad news is that the sample looks slightly too favorable to the GOP, although undeclared voters dominate the pool of respondents.\n\nIn Colorado, Romney has edged into the lead, with 48% support compared to Obama's 46%. Other recent polls have shown Obama up by one, two, and five points in Colorado. The last survey on that list was conducted by a Democrat firm. The Romney campaign believes this state is a pure toss-up right now.\n\nIn Virginia, a Washington Post poll shows Obama leading Romney by eight points, with a sample that is three points higher than the 2008 partisan split. However, Rasmussen recently pegged the Virginia race at 49-48 in Obama's favor, and other polls have it somewhere in between. Politico's Jonathan Martin is rather skeptical of the Washington Post poll's results.",
    " Title: Political Operative Charged with Battery in Nevada After Altercation at GOP Campaign Event\n\nA political operative from Virginia, Wilfred Michael Stark, has been charged with misdemeanor battery in Nevada following an incident at a Republican campaign event. Stark, who has a history of confronting Republican political figures, was arrested Tuesday evening and released from the Las Vegas city jail on $1,140 bail on Wednesday, according to Jace Radke, a city spokesman.\n\nThe incident occurred at a Las Vegas community center, where Stark, 50, of Falls Church, Virginia, allegedly pushed into the event and grabbed the manager of state Attorney General Adam Laxalt's gubernatorial campaign, Kristin Davison. Witnesses provided statements saying Stark declared several times, \"I do this for a living.\"\n\nStark told the officer who took him into custody that he was attacked \"because he was a Democrat in a room full of Republicans,\" according to the arrest report. The Laxalt campaign spokesman, Parker Briden, linked Stark with American Bridge 21st Century, a group that supports Democratic candidates and is committed to holding Republicans accountable.\n\nAmerican Bridge did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages regarding the incident. In March, the organization spoke on behalf of Stark following his arrest in Washington, D.C., on a simple assault charge for allegedly using his body to push a top aide to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke outside a congressional hearing. American Bridge said Stark \"adamantly\" denied the allegations.\n\nStark was also arrested a year ago in suburban Virginia and charged with creating a disturbance while videotaping a parade appearance by GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie for ShareBlue Media, an American Bridge affiliate. He was convicted of disorderly conduct, according to a report in the Fairfax County Times.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Davison made a citizen's arrest after she and witnesses said Stark pushed into the room and grabbed her arm hard enough to leave red marks. \"Mike Stark aggressively interrupted our conversation, both by loudly yelling and physically shoving a camera and his body at the attorney general and me,\" Davison's signed police complaint said. \"I asked him to back away and he did not.\"\n\nDemocratic candidate Steve Sisolak's campaign and state Democratic party officials denied any connection to Stark. \"No one should ever feel unsafe at a political event,\" Sisolak spokeswoman Christina Amestoy said in a statement. \"We strongly condemn this violence.\"",
    " Title: Analysis: Trump's China Trade Deal Falls Short of Promises, Fails to Address Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's long-awaited trade deal with China may finally be in the works, but according to experts, it falls short of the comprehensive agreement Trump once promised. The deal, which is still tentative and far from finalized, does not seem to address key issues such as China's protectionist and authoritarian economic policies, forced technology transfers, and state-owned enterprises.\n\nThe president's eagerness to tout the deal as a significant achievement is understandable, given his tariff strategy. However, objectively, the deal, at best, can be considered a mini-deal. At worst, it's a deal that fails to accomplish the goals Trump set out to achieve.\n\nOne of the most noticeable failures is the lack of a commitment from the Chinese government to relinquish its grip on its economy. The deal also remains unclear as to whether it will force China to stop asking foreign companies to hand over trade secrets. Moreover, China will likely continue to use its state-owned enterprises to artificially direct resources toward favored industries.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning aspect of the deal is that it could reinforce these Chinese behaviors. For instance, the deal requires China to use its state-owned enterprises to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually, a concession China already agreed to more than two years ago. This is not a victory; it's a concession that pursues the very top-down, government-directed policy Trump claimed he wanted to change.\n\nUnfortunately, the president may receive some praise for getting China to commit to buying more U.S. soybeans. However, economists argue that exports are costs, not benefits. Exports are goods that we give up in exchange for imports, and imports, and the consumption they allow, are the goal of trade, not exports.\n\nAfter almost four years of tariffs, manufacturing slowdowns, and rampant uncertainty, Trump's strategy has yielded few concessions from China. Meanwhile, the United States will maintain those punishing tariffs on roughly $360 billion worth of imports, leading to continued disruption of the supply chain at the expense of American companies and consumers.\n\nMoreover, the opportunity cost of the Trump strategy is often overlooked. Daniel Mitchell of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity notes that if Trump had joined with allies and used the World Trade Organization to go after China's mercantilist policies, the U.S. would be in a much better position today.\n\nIn light of all this, it's hard to see the trade war, even one that ends with this mini-deal, as a win for the United States. The deal fails to address key issues, maintains tariffs on a significant portion of Chinese imports, and could reinforce China's protectionist and authoritarian economic policies.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Rising Number of Americans Considered Underinsured Due to High Healthcare Costs\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Commonwealth Fund has found that approximately one-quarter of Americans with health insurance are underinsured, a figure that has nearly doubled since 2003. The study, which was reported by The Hill, estimates that 31 million insured individuals are not adequately protected against high healthcare costs.\n\nThe report attributes the increase in underinsured individuals to the rising deductibles, even with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The report warns that the continued growth in the prevalence and size of deductibles could lead to an increase in underinsurance in the future.\n\nThe survey also found that people who purchase lower-quality health coverage are less likely to seek medical care when they are sick or injured due to the fear of high out-of-pocket costs. Sara Collins, the study's lead author, told reporters that \"people who have high deductibles do tend to skimp on healthcare.\"\n\nAccording to the report, half of underinsured adults and 41 percent of privately insured adults with deductibles of at least $1,000 had medical bills totaling $4,000 or more. The report raises questions about the Obama administration's promise that millions of people would gain access to affordable healthcare under Obamacare.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the report does not take into account the people who were uninsured before 2014. Collins stated, \"We're unable to separately assess the effects of the law with these data.\"\n\nThe study also found that those most likely to be underinsured are employed by small businesses. Despite the increase in deductibles, healthcare costs overall have not risen as of late, something which the Obama administration has taken partial credit for. The report's findings cast doubt on the administration's claims regarding the affordability of healthcare under Obamacare.\n\nSpecifically, the rate of those underinsured has flattened over the last several years, with the biggest increases in the underinsured population occurring between 2003 and 2010. The study's findings suggest that the trend of rising deductibles may be a long-term issue that requires attention from policymakers.",
    " Title: Hollywood's Feminist Cheers and Wage Gap Revelation: A Closer Look at Hillary Clinton's Staff Pay Disparity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the recent revelation of wage disparity within Hillary Clinton's Senate staff has cast a shadow over the feminist fervor that swept through the Oscars last night. The news, reported by The Washington Free Beacon, reveals that during Clinton's tenure in the Senate, women on her staff were paid only 72 cents for every dollar paid to men.\n\nAccording to the analysis of data compiled from official Senate expenditure reports, the median annual salary for a woman working in Clinton's office was $15,708.38 less than the median salary for a man. This disparity is particularly ironic, given Clinton's long-standing advocacy for gender equality.\n\nTwenty years ago, women made 72 cents on the dollar to men. Today, it stands at 77 cents. Yet, the wage gap within Clinton's own office seems to have been a hidden \"ceiling\" for her staff.\n\nIn 2014, Clinton tweeted, \"More work to do. # EqualPay # NoCeilings.\" However, the data suggests that the \"ceilings\" she spoke of may have been right over her and her staff's own heads.\n\nIn June, The Washington Free Beacon also reported on another controversial issue involving Clinton, known as The Hillary Tapes, in which she defended a man who was accused of raping an underage girl.\n\nDespite these revelations, groups like Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List continue to honor Clinton's \"efforts\" on behalf of women. The same A-list celebrities who cheered for wage equality at the Oscars last night appear to have no problem being chummy with the former First Lady.\n\nThe question now is, after these pay gap revelations, will Clinton face the wrath of these famous feminists and popular women's rights groups, or will they continue to focus their ire on the \"real threat\" - the suffocating patriarchy? The answer, as always, remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Controversy Erupts Over India's \"Deradicalization\" Camps: Critics Question Intent and Methods\n\nArticle:\n\nIndia's newly appointed Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, has sparked controversy with his recent comments suggesting the existence of \"deradicalization\" camps in India, drawing parallels with China's internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang province.\n\nDuring a media address in New Delhi last week, Rawat stated, \"Like what we are seeing in Kashmir... we saw radicalization happening. There are people who have completely been radicalized. These people need to be taken out separately, possibly taken into some deradicalization camps. We have deradicalization camps going on in our country.\"\n\nThese comments have caused alarm among Kashmiris, who fear that India may be following China's approach in Xinjiang, where over a million Uighurs are reportedly detained in \"re-education camps\" to eradicate religious \"extremism.\"\n\nZafar Chowdhary, a Kashmiri political analyst, disagrees with the \"radicalization theory about Kashmir.\" He stated, \"I don't see this problem in Kashmir with the prism of radicalization.\"\n\nProfessor Noor Ahmad Baba, a political analyst based in Srinagar, the main city in the Muslim-majority region under lockdown for the past five months, echoed similar sentiments, stating, \"Kashmir is a political issue, there is nothing like radicalization. This is not a desirable thing to happen in a democracy. Kashmir is a political problem and needs a political solution.\"\n\nRawat's comments appear to be confirmed by a senior police official in Kashmir, who told media outlets that the first \"deradicalization\" center in Kashmir is planned. The official, who wished to remain anonymous, stated, \"The Jammu and Kashmir police department has conceptualized one de-radicalization center for which funds have been granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, but it is yet to be established.\"\n\nThe region's police chief, Dilbagh Singh, also supported the idea of \"deradicalization\" centers in Kashmir. \"If any such facility comes up in Kashmir, that will be a good sign. It'll definitely help people, especially those who have gone astray,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the idea of \"deradicalization\" centers has been met with skepticism and criticism from various quarters. Ajai Sahni, founding member and executive director of the Institute of Conflict Management in New Delhi, stated, \"Armed forces are and should be apolitical institutions, but such trends are disturbing and will have long-term consequences.\"\n\nRetired Air Vice Marshal Kapil Kak, who has been critical of the Indian government's move to abrogate Article 370 in Kashmir, expressed reservations about sending children to \"deradicalization\" camps. \"There is no denying that some extremists do try to influence people in Kashmir, but it is not politically correct to raise this issue to otherwise Kashmiris. Kids being put up in deradicalization camps is a horrendous proposition,\" he said.\n\nKak also expressed concerns about the increasing \"politicization of military and militarization of politics,\" which, according to him, does not bode well for India's democracy.\n\nGazala Wahab, executive editor of Force, India's leading magazine on national security, suggested that the politicization of the Indian army has been a \"slow and insidious process.\" She stated, \"Of course, this is extremely worrisome. A politicized military is the complete negation of democracy. In a multi-cultural, multi-religious country like India, a partisan military will be disastrous.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats' Stance on Affordable Care Act Remains Steadfast Despite Recent Vote on Health Plan Exemptions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked debate and raised questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), 39 House Democrats joined Republicans last Friday to pass a bill that allows insurers to offer health plans that do not comply with federal regulations. However, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has sought to reassure that the majority of Democrats remain supportive of the ACA.\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Pelosi emphasized that the vote was a political response and that the number of Democrats who have not fully supported the ACA has not significantly changed in the past few months. She stated, \"I have full confidence, as do my members, however they voted on this. This is political; they respond politically.\"\n\nPelosi pointed out that the bill, which is unlikely to progress to a Senate vote, provides an opportunity for House Democrats to express their opposition to the ACA in districts where it may be unpopular. She also acknowledged that the future of the ACA remains uncertain as Democrats prepare for re-election in 2022, following the rocky start of the federal health exchange website, HealthCare.gov.\n\nHowever, Pelosi emphasized the continued support of Democrats for the ACA, stating, \"I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nRather than focusing on the challenges faced by the ACA, such as the malfunctioning website and the president's broken promise to allow insurers to offer customers their old plans, Pelosi chose to highlight positive developments in states with their own health exchanges. For instance, California and Kentucky are reporting successful enrollments and positive feedback on the prices. California announced on Friday that it would soon offer online enrollment for the Small Business Health Options Program for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. As of November 12, approximately 60,000 people had selected insurance plans through California's exchange.\n\nIn conclusion, while the recent vote has raised concerns about the future of the ACA, House Democrats, led by Pelosi, have reaffirmed their commitment to the law and are focusing on the successes in states with their own health exchanges. The political landscape of the ACA will continue to evolve as the 2022 elections approach.",
    " Title: Michigan Attorney General Files Emergency Motion to Halt Jill Stein's Recount Request\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially escalate the post-election legal battles, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, has filed an emergency motion with the Michigan Supreme Court to halt the recount request by Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The aim is to bypass the Court of Appeals to expedite the process.\n\nSchuette's office issued a statement explaining the motion, stating, \"Michigan voters rejected Stein's candidacy by massive margins, but her refusal to accept the state-verified result poses an expensive and risky threat to hard-working taxpayers and abuses the intent of Michigan law.\"\n\nThe motion comes after Stein filed a request last week for a recount of Michigan's vote in the 2016 election, following a razor-thin margin that made Michigan the last state to be called. President-elect Donald Trump won Michigan's 16 electoral votes by just 0.2 percentage points, or approximately 10,000 votes out of over 5.5 million cast.\n\nStein is also challenging efforts to halt the recount in Wisconsin, where Trump supporters have attempted to stop the ongoing recount. In a statement, Stein's attorney, Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, said, \"The Jill Stein Campaign plans to intervene and join the Wisconsin Elections Commission in defending the recount. Citizens in Wisconsin and across the country have made it clear that they want a recount and deserve to see this process through to ensure integrity in the vote.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Stein defended her decision to request recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania\u2014three traditionally blue swing states that proved critical to Trump's upset victory. \"What we have are predictors that if tampering took place, it would be most likely to be discovered in the three states where we are looking,\" she said. \"Unless we actually look, we would never know.\"\n\nWhen asked about the potential lack of evidence, Stein responded, \"What voting technology experts tell us is that you can not tell unless you're actually counting paper votes. And I don't think the FBI has done that.\"\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court is yet to rule on the emergency motion. The outcome could set a precedent for the ongoing recount efforts in Wisconsin and potentially Pennsylvania.",

McNamee, who was an advisor to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the company's early years, argues that Facebook poses a threat to democracy, public health, and user privacy.\n\nIn his new book, \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\" (Penguin), McNamee details his transformation from a supporter of Facebook to a critic, stating that Facebook is \"terrible for America and needed to change or be changed.\"\n\nOn CBS This Morning on Monday, McNamee explained that internet giants like Facebook and Google have created products that exploit human psychology to create habits and addictions. He further stated that these companies failed to safeguard users from potential misuse by malicious actors.\n\nMcNamee attributes Facebook's success in creating a revolutionary social media platform, beneficial for advertisers, as the root of the problem. He argues that Facebook's advertising capabilities, which allow targeted advertising to a specific audience, also make it easier for bad actors to interfere in elections and manipulate users.\n\nMcNamee expressed concern over Facebook's recent legal troubles, including accusations of exploiting minors and violating the Fair Housing Act. In response, Facebook stated that it has fundamentally changed its operations to better protect user safety and security over the past two years. However, McNamee contends that Facebook has not always responded to issues or bad actors on the platform.\n\nMcNamee's book, \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe,\" is available in hardcover, eBook, and audio formats on Amazon. The book aims to provide readers with a better understanding of the issues surrounding Facebook and its impact on society.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Hardline Immigration Measures in DACA Negotiations, Sparking Controversy and Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and resistance, the Trump administration on Sunday released a list of hardline immigration demands as part of negotiations for a deal to allow young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers to stay in the US legally. The list, which includes funding for a border wall with Mexico, a crackdown on children from Central America, and a points-based system for migrants to gain entry to the US, has been met with rejection by Democrats and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\nThe Dreamers, individuals brought to the country illegally as children, are the focus of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was established by the Obama administration. The program shields them from deportation and allows them to work and attend school. About 690,000 recipients are enrolled in the program, with the last such work permits due to expire in March 2018.\n\nDemocrats, led by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have rejected the administration's list as \"immoral\" and \"far beyond what is reasonable.\" Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat from New Mexico and chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said on a conference call with reporters that Democrats were prepared to derail legislation if Republicans and the White House refused to back off.\n\n\"They are not going to have Democrats to get them over the finish line on anything they need,\" she said. \"We'll use every leverage point we have at our disposal to protect these Dreamers.\"\n\nDreamers and groups who advocate for them have reacted with horror to the administration's list. Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition (SBCC), called the decision to use Dreamers as a \"bargaining chip\" a \"shameful\" move.\n\nThe list of principles also calls for withholding federal grants for \"sanctuary cities\" and limiting legal immigration by issuing fewer family-based green cards to spouses and the minor children of US citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n\nWhile the administration's list has been met with criticism, some Trump supporters have expressed disappointment, claiming the president is \"going soft\" on his border wall promise. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, an immigration hardliner who announced the rollback of DACA, welcomed the proposals, stating they would \"restore the rule of law to our immigration system, prioritize America's safety and security, and end the lawlessness.\"\n\nThe White House has maintained that the agreement between the president and Democratic leaders had been mischaracterized, with a senior administration official stating, \"There was a deal to work on a deal as fast as possible.\" However, the administration has stated it is not interested in granting citizenship to Dreamers, a key demand of Democrats and activists.\n\nAs the negotiations continue, the future of the Dreamers and the state of US immigration policy remain uncertain.",

    " Title: Clinton Urges Swift Action on Syria's Chemical Weapons as Diplomatic Solution Gains Traction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed support for a diplomatic solution in the Syrian crisis, as the international community considers a proposal that would have Syria surrender its chemical weapons to international control. The proposal, which has been floated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russia, could potentially avert a U.S. military strike against Syria.\n\nClinton, who met with President Barack Obama on Monday, emphasized the importance of this step, but cautioned against it being used as a delaying tactic. She stated, \"The Assad regime's inhumane use of weapons of mass destruction against innocent men, women, and children violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order.\"\n\nThe White House is currently seeking Congressional approval for a military strike in response to Syria's chemical weapons attack. However, a new proposal suggests Syria could avoid a strike by surrendering its chemical weapons stockpiles. Clinton credited Kerry and the Russian government for proposing this solution.\n\nClinton urged the world to address the Syrian chemical weapons threat \"as swiftly and comprehensively as possible.\" She emphasized the need for Russia to support the international community's efforts, stating, \"Russia must support the world's efforts or be held accountable.\"\n\nThe Obama administration is stepping up pressure on a skeptical Congress to support U.S. military action, despite considering the Russian proposal. Obama is conducting a series of television interviews and is due to visit the Capitol to make his case to lawmakers.\n\nSyria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has welcomed the Russian proposal, while Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken has stated that the White House will closely examine the proposal but still supports Congressional approval for U.S. military action.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is considering asking the Security Council to demand Syria move its chemical arms stocks to Syrian sites where they can be safely stored and destroyed. Britain and France have also given the idea tentative support.\n\nThe intensifying lobbying by the Obama administration comes ahead of a crucial U.S. Senate test vote expected on Wednesday on whether to authorize military action in response to last month's chemical weapons attack against Syrian civilians. The outcome of the vote remains uncertain, with a majority of Congress still undecided.\n\nAssad, in an interview with CBS television, denied any link between his government and the suspected Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus that U.S. officials say killed over 1,400 people. If there were strikes against Syria, the United States \"should expect everything,\" Assad said.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that Russia could play a key role in encouraging Assad to stop the use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions under United Nations control until they can be destroyed.\n\nA survey by USA Today on Monday found that majorities in both the Senate and the House remain undecided on whether to back military action, complicating predictions about the outcome. A fraction of lawmakers - 22 senators and 22 House members - are on record as supporting strikes, with 19 senators and 130 House members saying they are against.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee narrowly passed a resolution last week that prohibited the insertion of U.S. ground combat troops in Syria and limited the intervention to a maximum of 90 days. With the hunt on for more votes, other alternatives are being explored. Representative Chris van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, is writing a resolution with Democrat Gerald Connolly of Virginia that would be narrower than the Senate resolution. The resolution would make it clear that the only purpose of military action is to deter Assad from future use of chemical weapons.\n\nSenator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, is working with Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia on an alternative that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin the process of turning over its weapons. \"During this time, the U.S. would work to build international support and create a global response on the use of chemical weapons in Syria,\" Heitkamp said.",
    " Title: Giuliani Defends Police in Eric Garner's Death, Criticizes Racial Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in an interview on Fox & Friends, asserted that racism was not a factor in the death of Eric Garner last July, as police officer Daniel Pantaleo used a chokehold while attempting to arrest him. Giuliani cited two reasons to support his claim: the presence of a black sergeant at the scene, and the fact that any suspect of similar circumstances would have been treated the same.\n\nProtests erupted in New York City and various other locations following Wednesday's announcement that Pantaleo would not be indicted in Garner's death. The demonstrations have drawn parallels with the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot by white policeman Darren Wilson last August. Similar to the Garner case, a grand jury also declined to indict Wilson, leading to protests in Ferguson and several cities.\n\nGiuliani accused New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, and others of tearing down respect for the criminal justice system by suggesting that racism was involved in the Garner incident. He argued that such comments contributed to the atmosphere of protests and, at times, violence.\n\nGiuliani maintained that it was racist to focus on the \"handful\" of incidents where blacks were killed by police, rather than the high numbers of black-on-black crime. He emphasized that police should never kill anyone unjustifiably but that the majority of attention should be directed towards the ways in which people in the black community are actually victimized.\n\nIn the aftermath of the grand jury announcement, Giuliani suggested that Mayor de Blasio should be advocating for patience and calm, and then focusing the majority of his time on addressing the ways in which people in the community are actually victimized if he truly cares about them.\n\nGiuliani also criticized New York Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel for stating that it was \"totally impossible to believe that someone can die, and nobody is indicted.\" He described Rangel's comment as \"absurd\" and intended to inflame people.\n\nGiuliani suggested that activists like Sharpton could achieve something constructive if they spoke about crime in the black community with the same passion and intention as they did in the \"few situations where police shoot someone.\" He argued that both Garner and Brown had committed crimes, and that perhaps they \"would not be dead today\" if they had not resisted arrest.\n\nFinally, Giuliani defended the grand jury process, stating that he had always found grand juries to be extraordinarily conscientious citizens who take their oath and the complexity of the law seriously.",
    " Title: President Obama Distances Himself from Iraq Troop Withdrawal, Citing Iraqi Government's Rejection of U.S. Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama has distanced himself from the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, a move he had long touted as a significant foreign policy achievement. The shift in narrative comes as the Islamic State (IS) militant group gains territory in Iraq, prompting U.S. airstrikes and humanitarian air drops.\n\nDuring a press briefing before departing for a two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, President Obama stated that the absence of American troops in Iraq was due to the Iraqi government's rejection of a follow-on force, not his administration's decision.\n\n\"The reason that we did not have a follow-on force in Iraq was because the Iraqis \u2014 a majority of Iraqis did not want U.S. troops there, and politically they could not pass the kind of laws that would be required to protect our troops in Iraq,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nThis new perspective on the 2011 troop withdrawal has sparked criticism from political pundits who see it as a departure from the president's previous stance. Ron Fournier of the National Journal commented that the president is distancing himself from his own record, while James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board noted that Mr. Obama is no longer claiming credit for the removal of American forces, a point he frequently boasted about in the past.\n\nThe president's revised account of the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal differs significantly from his 2012 portrayal, during his re-election campaign, when he often took credit for fully ending American involvement in Iraq and for leaving no U.S. boots on the ground.\n\nIn a 2012 debate with Republican Mitt Romney, the president seemed to deny supporting a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government, a deal that would have allowed American troops to remain in Iraq and protected them from prosecution in Iraqi courts.\n\nThe White House's shift in narrative on Iraq comes as President Obama's broader foreign policy is under scrutiny across the political spectrum. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama's 2008 Democratic primary rival and the party's 2016 presidential front-runner, questioned the administration's foreign policy principle in an interview with The Atlantic.\n\nRepublicans have been more critical, charging that Mr. Obama is proving his incompetence with his handling of the Iraq crisis. Analysts argue that the president is correct about the Iraqi government's rejection of U.S. forces, but they also point out that the Islamic State's control of key areas across Iraq, including the nation's largest dam, has debunked the claim that the U.S. left behind a stable Iraq.",
    " Title: French President Macron Cautions Trump on Iran, Climate Change, and Trade Ahead of State Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has emphasized his strong relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, but has also expressed concerns about Trump's stances on Iran, climate change, and international trade in an exclusive interview with Fox News ahead of his visit to the United States this week.\n\nIn the interview, Macron stated, \"You can not make a trade war with your allies. It's too complicated. If you make war against everybody, you make trade war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran -- come on -- it doesn't work. You need allies.\"\n\nThe visit, which includes a dinner with Trump and first lady Melania Trump at Mount Vernon on Monday and a state dinner at the White House on Tuesday, will mark Trump's first official state visit since taking office last year. Macron is also scheduled to make a joint address to Congress on Wednesday.\n\nMacron described his relationship with Trump as \"very special,\" suggesting that they are political \"mavericks\" committed to fighting terrorism and reducing the influence of rogue nations and dictators. However, he cautioned Trump against withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal, which lifts economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for leaders winding down their nuclear program, ahead of a May 12 sanctions deadline.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied with the situation with Iran, but don't leave the deal without a 'better option,'\" said Macron, adding that the issue would be discussed during the week. He also expressed optimism that Trump would exempt European countries from the international tariffs he intends to impose on aluminum and steel.\n\nMacron also addressed the controversy surrounding his role in persuading Trump to keep U.S. forces in Syria. He suggested that the U.S. should maintain a diplomatic presence in Syria, as a regime change would \"fuel the new terrorists\" and create a vacuum in which the \"Iranian regime\" would thrive.\n\nMacron also plans to ask Congress for its support in efforts to stamp out terrorism and rein in rogue nations. He described the U.S. as \"one of the last resorts\" for peace and multilateralism and believes that the ongoing investigation into whether the 2016 Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the White House race has \"no impact\" on Trump's credibility and effectiveness on the world stage.\n\nMacron also stated, \"I'm not the one to judge Trump over current controversies or investigations.\" He added, \"We are very much attached to the same values... especially liberty and peace.\" He also emphasized the U.S.'s \"very strong role to play for peace in different regions of the world and especially the Middle East.\"",
    " Title: Discrepancies Emerge Between Michael Cohen's Guilty Plea and Donald Trump Jr.'s Congressional Testimony\n\nThe recent guilty plea by Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Donald Trump, has raised questions about the testimony given by Donald Trump Jr. to Congress regarding the family's real estate negotiations with Russian entities.\n\nIn his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, Donald Trump Jr. stated that he was only \"peripherally aware\" of negotiations that Cohen has admitted to carrying on through June 2016. However, Cohen's guilty plea has revealed that these negotiations continued beyond that time, well into the presidential campaign.\n\nCohen admitted in his plea that he had briefed Trump's family members about his talks, although the court documents do not specify who. Trump Jr. also told Senate investigators that he was not aware that Cohen had reached out to the press secretary for Vladimir Putin as part of his talks with Moscow about a putative new Trump Tower project there.\n\nIn his plea, Cohen acknowledged that he had corresponded with Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, and that negotiations about the project continued until after Trump had become the presumptive GOP nominee. This contradicts Cohen's previous statement that the discussions with people in Moscow concluded by January 2016.\n\nTrump Jr.'s answers allude to a number of prospective projects; he was asked by Senate investigators about news reports about a Trump Tower Moscow negotiation that took place in 2015 and 2016, which he acknowledged but did not detail.\n\nAttorney for President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, stated on Thursday that no laws have been broken and that the information that underpins Cohen's plea actually came from the Trump Organization\u2014confirming that it has been supporting the ongoing investigations.\n\nThe contrasts between Cohen's statement and Trump Jr.'s version of events may complicate potential legal problems for Trump Jr. Although seldom prosecuted, lying to Congress is against the law\u2014as evidenced by Cohen's plea.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, has made referrals to the office of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller because he believes people have not given his committee the truth. He declined to identify who might be involved or how often he has referred cases to Mueller, but Burr did allude to Cohen's plea as an example of what he called the consequences that could be involved.\n\n\"One instance just highlighted of late is that the special prosecutor made an indictment yesterday using the transcripts of interviews we have done in our committee to indict somebody for lying to Congress,\" Burr said on Friday. \"It's a loud message to everybody that is interviewed by our committee... If you lie to us, we're going to go after you.\"",
    " Title: Kavanaugh Stresses Judicial Independence, Refuses to Criticize or Praise Trump in Senate Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-day Senate confirmation hearing, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh emphasized the judiciary's authority to check the power of the White House, while declining to comment on President Donald Trump's character or his criticism of the judiciary.\n\nOn the second day of questioning, Kavanaugh remained evasive when asked about Trump's views on the judiciary or his character. The hearing, which took place on Capitol Hill, was disrupted by protesters opposed to Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nDemocrats pressed Kavanaugh over newly released emails that highlighted his views on abortion and racial issues. The documents, dating from Kavanaugh's service in the White House under President George W. Bush more than a decade ago, were released following a partisan fight over their public release.\n\nSenate Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican leadership not to make the emails public.\n\nKavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, was asked whether he was picked because of an expectation of loyalty to Trump. He responded, \"My only loyalty is to the Constitution. I'm an independent judge.\"\n\nWhen asked if he had \"the greatest respect\" for Trump, a phrase Kavanaugh had used when describing Bush, Kavanaugh declined to answer.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin said Kavanaugh's nomination comes at a time when Trump poses a threat to America's rule of law and is facing an ongoing special counsel investigation. Kavanaugh said his 12 years as a judge demonstrated he was unafraid \"to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.\"\n\nKavanaugh declined to answer questions on how a 1974 Supreme Court ruling against President Richard Nixon could be applied to the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nIf confirmed, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the top U.S. court even further to the right. This prospect worries Democrats and heartens Republicans on volatile issues including abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the death penalty, religious liberty, and business regulation.\n\nThe committee considering Kavanaugh's nomination will hear from outside witnesses on Friday before the hearing concludes. Republicans hope the full Senate can vote on the nomination close to the time the Supreme Court's new term starts on Oct 1.\n\nIn a 2003 email released on Thursday, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated, \"It is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.\n\nAsked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, although he indicated - as he did on Wednesday - that it was a decision that merited respect as \"an important precedent of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe hearing opened with Democrats complaining that various documents had not already been made public by the committee's Republican leaders. They were released by the committee minutes later.\n\nSenator Cory Booker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public \"a bit of a sham,\" a characterization rejected by the panel's Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley. Booker said he was willing to face possible punishment under Senate rules by releasing the documents himself, although Republicans said they had already agreed to release them.\n\nTrump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.",
    " Title: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Remains in Office Amid Reports of Resignation and 25th Amendment Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein remains in his position, following reports on Monday that suggested he had resigned or was planning to do so. The White House confirmed that President Donald Trump and Rosenstein had an extended conversation about the news stories published last week, which reported that Rosenstein discussed secretly recording the president or invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n\nThe two are scheduled to meet on Thursday, after the president's return from the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated in a statement that the meeting was at Rosenstein's request. The White House did not comment on reports that Rosenstein was expected to be fired imminently or had resigned.\n\nThe deputy attorney general oversees the investigation of Russian election interference and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The New York Times reported last week that he discussed secretly recording the president and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Rosenstein has since disputed the report, stating it was \"inaccurate.\"\n\nIf Rosenstein were to leave his post, it would potentially throw into question the oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Under the Department of Justice succession statute, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would be left in charge of supervising Mueller. However, Trump might be able to appoint a temporary replacement on an \"acting\" basis for up to 210 days, who would need to have passed Senate confirmation for another post or be a senior official from a relevant department.\n\nAs anticipation of Rosenstein's departure grew on Monday, Democrats in Congress and former federal prosecutors called on Republicans to speak out in favor of protecting the Mueller investigation. Representative Val Demings of Florida stated, \"Congress must take immediate steps.\" Former US attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, tweeted, \"Time to protect the Mueller investigation. Now.\"\n\nRosenstein was overseeing Mueller's work after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to his contacts with Russian officials when he was part of the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly attacked Sessions for that move. In overseeing the special counsel, Rosenstein is responsible for approving major new directions in the investigation, for signing off on the budget, and for meeting regularly with Mueller to assess the investigation's progress.\n\nFor more than a year, Trump has railed against the Russia investigation, calling it a \"witch hunt\" and accusing the prosecutors involved, many of whom, like Rosenstein and Mueller, are Republicans, of harboring ulterior partisan motives. Trump's relationship with Rosenstein has been strained. The president has tweeted that Rosenstein is \"weak\" but in August he also said the relationship was \"fantastic.\"\n\nFrustration moved in both directions, with Rosenstein reportedly growing \"angry\" at Trump in May 2017, after Trump used a memo written by Rosenstein to justify the firing of FBI director James Comey. It was in the sensitive aftermath of that firing that Rosenstein suggested recording the president, the Times reported. One source told the Times Rosenstein had suggested recording the president \"sarcastically\"; others said he was serious.\n\nSources for the Times report included people familiar with memos kept by former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe about his conversations with Rosenstein. McCabe was fired by Trump in March, days before he was due to retire. In a statement on Monday, amid speculation that McCabe desired to undercut Rosenstein \u2013 his onetime superior at the justice department who played a direct role in the firing of McCabe's former boss, Comey \u2013 McCabe denied any hand in leaking the contents of his memos to the media.\n\n\"To be clear, I had no role in providing information of any kind to the media stories about events following director Comey's firing,\" McCabe said.\n\nThe 25th Amendment, which was ratified after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, provides for various paths of presidential succession, including in case of the president being deemed \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" by the vice-president and a majority of cabinet officers. At a briefing to talk about the UN General Assembly, top foreign policy officials were peppered with questions about Rosenstein and the 25th Amendment.\n\n\"Literally, I have never been in the White House when that conversation has happened,\" said the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley. \"I'm not aware of any cabinet members that are even talking about that. It is completely and totally absurd.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, \"There was no discussion with me about the 25th Amendment, so you can now report that there were two senior leaders who said your question is ludicrous.\"",
    " Title: Politics and the Olympics: A Century of Intrusion and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Olympics, a global celebration of sports and goodwill, has long been a platform for political intrusion and controversy. The upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, is no exception, as President Obama has decided not to attend, marking the first time since 2000 that the U.S. will not be represented by a president, vice president, first lady, or former president.\n\nIn lieu of the president, Obama has chosen to send athletes such as openly gay tennis great Billie Jean King and two-time hockey medalist Caitlin Cahow to represent the country. This decision has been applauded by American gay-rights groups, who are angered by an anti-gay law Russia enacted in June.\n\nThe Olympic charter bans any \"kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda\" from Olympic sites. However, political protest and international gamesmanship have been a near-constant during modern games. The Council on Foreign Relations even hosts a slide show highlighting controversies over the past century, narrated by NPR contributor Frank Deford.\n\nThe Olympics have been a source of political intrusion since their inception. The 1972 Summer Games in Munich are remembered mostly for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian terrorists. In an earlier Olympics, in Berlin in the summer of 1936, Adolf Hitler's plans to showcase his theories of racial superiority were blown apart by African-American sprinter Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals.\n\nPolitics continued to intrude during the Cold War, with the U.S. taking great pride in its \"Miracle on Ice\" upset win by the men's hockey team over the Soviets in the winter of 1980. Conversely, the Soviets trumpeted their victory in men's basketball in the summer of 1972 - the first time the Americans had lost an Olympic basketball game, let alone the gold medal.\n\nThe last Olympics held in Russia - during the summer of 1980 in Moscow - saw a U.S.-led boycott by more than 60 nations in protest of the invasion of Afghanistan by what was then the Soviet Union. In retaliation, the Soviets led more than a dozen socialist countries in refusing to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were held in Los Angeles.\n\nThe 1988 games in Sydney were the first Summer Games since 1972 that were not the subject of a formal boycott. In 1976, some African nations were angry that the International Olympic Committee allowed New Zealand to participate in the games despite the fact that its rugby team had recently toured in South Africa. Because of apartheid, South Africa's racial segregation laws, South Africa was barred from the games from 1964 until 1992. Some 30 African nations stayed home from Montreal to protest New Zealand's inclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, China and Taiwan have had frequent spats over the freedom to compete. China stayed home between 1956 and 1980, after Taiwan was admitted as a separate entrant. For its part, Taiwan withdrew from the 1976 games after China pressured Canada not to allow the island nation to compete.\n\nChina was eager to showcase its economic success at the Beijing Summer Games in 2008. Many groups protested the country's human rights record, but formal boycotts did not get off the ground. President George W. Bush attended the Beijing Olympics, but both Obama and his GOP presidential rival that year, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said they would have stayed home if they were in the White House.\n\nLast year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who had proved his managerial mettle in helping to run the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, earned himself public rebukes from British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson by suggesting there were \"disconcerting\" signs that London was not quite ready to host the Summer Games.\n\nOther individuals have used the Olympics as a political platform - notably Tommie Smith and John Carlos, African-American athletes who had finished first and third in the 200-meter race at the 1968 games in Mexico. On the winner's stand, they raised their fists in the black power salute as a protest against racism back home.\n\nFor the most part, though, it's been nations themselves that have used the games as a political platform. U.S. relations with Russia may not be as bleak as during the Cold War days, but given recent differences, some sort of political squabbling around the upcoming games may have been inevitable. Back in 2008 - long before Russia passed its \"homosexual propaganda\" law - two Pennsylvania representatives called for the games to be moved out of Sochi, because of Russia's movement of troops into Georgia.\n\n\"The Olympics has a long history of issues that intrude from the outside,\" says historian and journalist Eric Marcus. \"It's always been incredibly naive to think somehow you can screen out everything that's going on in the world during a given period of time, particularly in a part of the world that's problematic.\"",
    " Title: China Reports Record Rise in Imported COVID-19 Cases as Students and Expats Return Home\n\nArticle:\n\nChina has reported a record rise in imported coronavirus cases, with 41 new cases confirmed on Friday, all of which were traced to overseas travel. The National Health Commission reported that the total number of such cases has reached 269, with no locally transmitted cases for the third consecutive day.\n\nThe influx of cases is primarily due to students returning from the United States and Europe, as well as China-based expats returning to the country as businesses begin to reopen. The cities of Beijing and Shanghai have been the main entry points for the returnees.\n\nIn Beijing, five of the 14 new imported cases were Chinese students returning from abroad. In Shanghai, five of the record nine cases were students flying back from Britain, France, and Switzerland. The southern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as Shaanxi and Sichuan, have also reported cases.\n\nIn response to the influx of cases, authorities across China are tightening public health measures. Guangdong's health commission has announced that travelers entering Guangdong province from abroad will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on arrival, either in personal residences or at a centralized quarantine center at the expense of the traveler.\n\nWhile the influx of infections from overseas remains modest, it presents a potential threat to Chinese authorities keen to restart factories and get consumers to spend again. Analysts have slashed forecasts for China's first-quarter gross domestic product to levels not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with all sectors of the economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak this year.\n\nThe total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,008 at the end of Friday, with a death toll of 3,255, up by seven. The lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscores a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions, even in the virus epicenter of Wuhan.\n\nOn Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency reported that commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of the virus can resume business. The first phase of a clinical trial of a vaccine has also begun, with 36 volunteers undergoing a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location.",
    " Title: Partisan Divide Stalls Defense Spending Bill on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Defense spending bill, a crucial piece of legislation that accounts for half of the country's discretionary budget, has become the latest casualty in the ongoing partisan divide on Capitol Hill. For decades, Republicans and Democrats have largely agreed on this bill, which funds troops, ships, and aircraft, and sets military policy.\n\nLast week, the Senate failed to vote on the bill due to the reluctance of Majority Leader Harry Reid to open contentious issues, such as government spying, and to avoid a vote on new sanctions on Iran as world leaders neared a deal to curb Iran's nuclear enrichment program (an interim deal was reached over the weekend).\n\nRepublicans accused the leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate of making a power grab, demanding they be allowed to offer amendments and vote on them, a practice that has been the norm for decades. They also argued that Reid uses too heavy a hand in running the chamber and that the defense bill could have been passed months ago. However, it was delayed until the last minute to spare President Obama a few national security black eyes.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, pleaded for some amendments, offering a whittled list of 25 GOP amendments from the list of 350 put forth by members of both parties.\n\nReid also did not want the last bill likely out of Congress this year to become a magnet for other matters. \"Everyone has to understand this is not going to be an open amendment process,\" Reid told his colleagues as he sought to limit amendments and wrap up the $625 billion defense measure after some three days of debate. He contends GOP delaying tactics have forced his hand.\n\nWith just a few legislative days left in the year, the latest machinations leave in jeopardy a bill that authorizes money for personnel, war-fighting equipment, and the conflict in Afghanistan. The Senate has to pass its bill and reconcile it with a version the House approved in June.\n\nIf the Senate cannot break the impasse when lawmakers return on December 9, troops will still get paid, and fighter jets will continue to be built thanks to the separate, all-encompassing spending bill. However, major policy changes might be lost, including several new measures to stem the epidemic of sexual assaults in the military.\n\nDoing without an authorization bill for the first time in half a century also would represent the fall of one of last bastions of comity in Congress. \"I'm nowhere close to giving up on completing the defense authorization bill, even though we will only have days, not weeks, to complete it,\" Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe dysfunction is \"approaching an all-time low,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has participated in far more cordial, as well as more open, debates of the defense bill in decades past. In decades past, the leadership often stepped aside and let the chairman and ranking member take charge, debating the bill for hours around-the-clock, allowing numerous Republican and Democratic amendments and plenty of votes.\n\nArnold Punaro, who worked for former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., from 1973 to 1997 as a top aide and later staff director of the Armed Services Committee, remembers former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, keeping senators on the bill for days on end, wrapping up the legislation at 3 a.m. Amendments were offered, accepted, or rejected. Some senators eventually would abandon amendments under the long hours that Tower would make them be there for the debate. The Senate typically spent more than a week on the bill, Monday through Friday and sometimes Saturday, rather than the current schedule of Tuesday to Thursday.\n\nThis past week, the Senate voted on two amendments dealing with the fate of the detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Reid sought votes on measures addressing sexual assault in the services after some five hours of debate on Wednesday. Republicans objected as they pressed for other amendments. By comparison, the House considered 172 amendments when it debated its version of the defense bill in June. It agreed to 148 of them by voice vote and held 21 recorded votes. Seven amendments were added to the bill through recorded votes over three days of debate, and 14 were rejected.\n\nThe Senate purposely avoids the time constraints imposed in the House. However, votes on just two amendments to the Senate defense bill, plus the measures on sexual assault, before final passage would have been an unusually low number for such a far-reaching measure. Inhofe said that in the past 17 years, the Senate has debated the bill an average of nine days, held an average of 11 roll call votes, and adopted nearly 100 amendments by voice vote.\n\nThe impasse, combined with the brouhaha over how Democrats unilaterally changed the Senate's filibuster rules on Thursday, left the Senate's defense stalwarts pessimistic about the road ahead. \"There's a lot of turmoil, and I'd like to tell you that the 2014 elections will fix everything,\" McCain said. \"I'm not sure that's the case. I think the problems go deeper than that.\"",
    " Title: House Democrats Announce Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump and Secure USMCA Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, marking a significant political milestone, while simultaneously announcing a pending deal on a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact (USMCA). The coincidental timing of these events has sparked debate, with some suggesting a grand timing plan to distract from impeachment proceedings. However, sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the deal fell into place only after intense final negotiations over the weekend, with a signing ceremony in Mexico City on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe USMCA, a revamped version of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has been a priority for President Trump. Some Democrats have also been advocating for improvements to the deal. The agreement's announcement Tuesday morning was necessary to accommodate the signing ceremony in Mexico City later in the day.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demonstrating the Democrats' ability to deliver on key legislative initiatives while pursuing President Trump's impeachment. The USMCA's passage is a testament to the collaboration between labor, the Trump White House, and House Democrats.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), one of eight members Pelosi tapped to be USMCA negotiators, stated at a news conference Tuesday that Democrats removed onerous provisions the White House had proposed. Vice President Mike Pence countered that Democrats \"acquiesced\"; however, Schakowsky argued that the Trump administration sent a deeply flawed trade deal that would have raised prescription drug prices across North America. The new deal, she said, prevents big pharmaceutical companies from raising the price of prescription drugs across the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will consider the articles of impeachment at an evening session Wednesday, with the full House expected to vote next week.\n\nIn a separate development, several freshman House Democrats shared their thoughts on the impeachment inquiry's impact on their districts. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), the most endangered Illinois House incumbent, discussed the issue at Politico's \"Women Rule Summit\" on Tuesday. Underwood, who flipped a suburban Chicago district voting for Trump in 2016, noted that political corruption is a familiar concept in her district, given Chicago's history.\n\nAnother freshman, Democrat Sean Casten, who beat a Republican in 2018 and is a major GOP 2020 target, stated that the two articles on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress zero in on \"where there's unambiguous, unambiguously clear evidence.\" Casten added that the articles are \"the closest to no-brainers that I could think of.\"\n\nRep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), who is looking for Republican crossover support in the Democratic primary, stated he will \"carefully consider\" the impeachment articles \"in light of the evidence that has been brought forward in the inquiry.\"\n\nRep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) is facing a Democratic primary challenge from the left. He stated flat out that he supports the Articles of Impeachment against President Trump and intends to vote for them on the House floor next week.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), the only Chicago-area Republican, expressed concern that impeachment is \"leaving us even more divided than before.\" He believes that voters will have the final say in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), who represents a safe GOP downstate district, stated that Democrats are attempting to overturn the results of the 2016 election rather than letting the people decide in November.\n\nThe unfolding events in Washington demonstrate the political chess game being played out, with the impeachment inquiry and the USMCA trade deal serving as significant pieces on the board. The outcome of these events will undoubtedly shape the political landscape in the coming months.",
    " Title: Bostock v. Clayton County Decision Casts Doubt on Trump Administration's New Health Care Regulation Permitting Discrimination Against LGBTQ Patients\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Trump administration has finalized a regulation that allows health providers to discriminate against LGBTQ patients. This regulation, however, faces serious challenges following the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which has broadened the interpretation of sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Bostock does not just question the new health care regulation; it also casts doubt on the Trump administration's stance against anti-discrimination protections for transgender students in education. With Bostock, schools and colleges that receive federal funding are now likely to be held liable for discrimination against LGBTQ students.\n\nBostock established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination \"because of... sex,\" is broad enough to forbid workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. If an employer intentionally relies on an individual employee's sex when making a decision to terminate the employee, or if changing the employee's sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer, then the employer violates Title VII, according to Bostock.\n\nFor instance, if an employer permits male employees to date and have sex with women but doesn't permit female employees to do the same, it engages in forbidden sex discrimination.\n\nBeyond Title VII, other federal laws also prohibit sex discrimination. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Affordable Care Act both ban discrimination \"on the basis of sex.\" These provisions apply to nearly all public schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals, as they receive federal assistance of some kind, such as through student financial aid or through Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBostock suggests that neither educational institutions nor health care providers may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals. If that's the case, the Trump administration's new health care regulation should fall. Lawyers challenging anti-LGBTQ discrimination by schools and health providers are likely to notify judges of the Court's decision in Bostock, and new lawsuits may be prepared to strike down the new health care regulation.\n\nThe Obama administration interpreted Obamacare's ban on discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in a similar manner to the Supreme Court's interpretation in Bostock. The Trump administration's new regulations, however, interpret the word \"sex\" much more narrowly. The Trump administration claims that its narrow interpretation reads Obamacare \"according to the plain meaning of the word'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology.\"\n\nWhen a federal statute is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted in multiple ways, the Supreme Court's decisions permit federal regulators to choose from among those reasonable interpretations. However, Bostock eliminates any ambiguity regarding the meaning of the word \"sex.\" It has now been firmly established by the Supreme Court of the United States that a ban on \"sex\" discrimination also bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Bostock, in other words, should establish once and for all that no educational institution or health provider may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals\u2014at least if they wish to receive federal funds.\n\nThere is, however, at least one part of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda that is likely to survive contact with the courts. In 2017, Trump announced his intention to prohibit transgender service members from openly serving in the military. Although some lower courts struck down this ban, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to temporarily reinstate the ban. It's likely that the Court did so because it often defers to the elected branches on questions relating to the military or to national security.\n\nOutside of the military, however, Bostock is a sweeping decision with implications stretching far beyond employment discrimination. Although the trans military ban may survive, much of the rest of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda is in serious trouble after Bostock.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Clarifies Conditions for Stripping Immigrants' U.S. Citizenship for False Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court has clarified that federal law allows courts to revoke the U.S. citizenship of individuals who obtained it through false statements, but only if the false statements played a role in the acquisition of their citizenship.\n\nIn the case of Maslenjak v. United States, the Court vacated a lower court's decision and remanded the case back for further proceedings. Divna Maslenjak, a Serb who sought refugee status in 1998, falsely stated on her application for U.S. citizenship that she and her family had feared persecution due to her husband's evasion of military service.\n\nThe Court's decision, written by Justice Elena Kagan, held that the government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in their acquisition of citizenship. In this case, the Court ruled that the jury should have been told to decide the factual question of whether Maslenjak's lying about her husband's military service was part of the cause of obtaining her own citizenship.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, arguing that the majority's framework was too elaborate and that the Court should have sent the case back down with a less-elaborate holding. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a separate concurring opinion, stating that the immigration statute is violated when a person says something that is \"material\" to the naturalization process of obtaining citizenship, but not necessarily part of the cause of obtaining citizenship.\n\nKen Klukowski, senior legal editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, commented on the case, stating that the Court's decision provides clarity on the conditions for stripping immigrants' U.S. citizenship for false statements. The case will now return to the trial court for a new jury proceeding where a correct explanation of the law will be provided to the jury.",
    " Title: Obama's Budget Proposal Faces Resistance as House Speaker John Boehner Rejects Tax Hike Tie-In with Social Security Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a preemptive move, House Speaker John Boehner has rejected President Obama's call for more tax hikes, following the revelation that the president's upcoming budget will link tax increases to modest changes in Social Security and other benefit programs. The president is set to unveil his budget on Wednesday, with a senior administration official confirming that the plan includes a provision to lower cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security, which would curb the growth in benefits.\n\nThe administration has made it clear that it is offering changes to Social Security and Medicare, the two most important benefit programs for seniors, in an attempt to convince Republicans to accept increased revenues. The official stated that the plan to be unveiled next week \"is not a menu of options for them to choose from -- it's a cohesive package.\"\n\nBoehner, however, has expressed disapproval of the demand, noting that the president and his party already extracted tax increases on top earners as part of the deal to avert the fiscal crisis at the end of 2012. \"In the end, the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts. At some point we need to solve our spending problem, and what the president has offered would leave us with a budget that never balances. In reality, he's moved in the wrong direction, routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he's previously told me he could support,\" Boehner said.\n\nDemocrats have argued that the recently enacted sequester cuts are too deep and continue to press for tax increases to help close the deficit. Many Democrats oppose drastic changes to entitlements. The inclusion of the Social Security provision by Obama was meant as a gesture to Republicans, and one that has already drawn the ire of liberal members of Congress.\n\nBoehner suggested that the changes did not go far enough to warrant tax increases. \"When the president visited the Capitol last month, House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases. If reports are accurate, the president has not heeded that call,\" Boehner said. \"If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes. That's no way to lead and move the country forward.\"\n\nObama's plan calls for additional tax revenue, including a proposal to place limits on tax-preferred retirement accounts for top earners. Obama has also called for limits on tax deductions by top earners, a proposal that could generate about $580 billion in revenue over 10 years. The administration claimed to be offering the Social Security change reluctantly.\n\nThe president could face an even tougher time selling the Social Security change to liberal members of Congress. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., fired off a statement Thursday responding to what was then the rumor that Obama's budget could include the change. \"Millions of working people, seniors, disabled veterans, those who have lost a loved one in combat, and women will be extremely disappointed if President Obama caves into the long-standing Republican effort to cut Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans and their survivors through a so-called chained CPI,\" Sanders said. \"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama told the American people that he would not cut Social Security. Having him go back on his word will only add to the rampant political cynicism that our country is experiencing today.\"\n\nChained CPI is the Washington term for the revised inflation adjustment that would effectively curb annual increases in a broad swath of government programs, but would have its biggest impact on Social Security. The inflation adjustment would reduce federal spending over 10 years by about $130 billion, according to past White House estimates. Because it also affects how tax brackets are adjusted, it would also generate about $100 billion in higher taxes and affect even middle-income taxpayers.\n\nObama's budget, to be released next week, comes after the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate passed separate and markedly different budget proposals. House Republicans achieved long-term deficit reductions by targeting safety net programs; Democrats instead protected those programs and called for $1 trillion in tax increases.\n\nObama's budget proposal includes features from an offer he made to House Speaker John Boehner during fiscal negotiations last year. Those talks ultimately failed, but Congress did agree to increase tax rates on top earners. The reductions in growth of benefit programs, which would affect veterans, the poor, and older Americans, is sure to anger many Democrats.\n\nLabor groups and liberals have long been critical of Obama's offer to Boehner for including such a plan. Obama's new plan would also replace the sequester with other spending cuts. But it will steer clear of major cuts to Medicaid, including tens of billions in reductions to the health care plan for the poor that the administration had proposed only last year.",
    " Title: Walgreens Boots Alliance to Close 200 U.S. Stores, Boosts Cost-Cutting Initiative by $500 Million\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at boosting its cost-cutting initiative, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has announced plans to close approximately 200 U.S. stores. This decision comes as part of the company's first earnings report since its merger with European drug retailer Alliance Boots last year.\n\nThe largest U.S. drugstore chain expects to reduce costs by a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. The company has identified additional opportunities for cost savings, primarily in its Retail Pharmacy USA division.\n\nThe soon-to-be closed stores make up roughly 2% of the Walgreens' 8,232 drugstores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company opened 71 new drugstores in this region in the first half of fiscal 2015, including 25 relocations.\n\nWalgreens' spokesman Philip Caruso stated that the company has not yet decided which stores it will close, but it is \"not focusing on any specific geographic area.\" Caruso also mentioned that there is \"no hard timeline\" for when the stores will be closed during the period for cost cutting.\n\nDespite the store closings, Walgreens impressed shareholders with strong earnings. Shares jumped $4.94, or 5.6%, to $92.62.\n\nWalgreens reported adjusted second-quarter net earnings increased 33.2% to $1.2 billion. Second-quarter sales, meanwhile, increased 35.5% to $26.6 billion. The U.S. retail pharmacy division, which includes Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, posted sales in the second quarter of $21 billion, up 7.4% over the year-ago quarter. Total sales in stores open at least a year were up 6.9% over the same quarter a year ago.\n\nIn December, Walgreens closed on a deal, valued at close to $16 billion, to purchase the remaining stake of European health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots that it did not already own. The new company, which includes more than 12,800 stores in 11 countries, was renamed Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and it took on ticker symbol WBA.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Delivers Stirring Speech at CPAC, Criticizes Obama, Bloomberg, and the Political Establishment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, former Alaska Governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin compared President Barack Obama to white-collar criminal Bernie Madoff, mocked New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his soda ban, and criticized the Republican Party for focusing on image rather than restoring public trust.\n\nDelivering one of the most well-received speeches of the weekend, Palin reserved particular vitriol for President Obama. \"He is considered a good politician, which is like saying Bernie Madoff was a good salesman,\" she said. \"The difference being, the president is using our money.\" She urged him to \"step away from the teleprompter and do your job.\"\n\nDuring her more than 26-minute speech, Palin displayed the same renegade sensibility that won her the admiration of many Republicans when she emerged as Sen. John McCain's running mate in 2008. \"Now is the time to furlough the consultants,\" she said, echoing a common refrain at this weekend's conference. \"If we truly know what we believe, we don't need professionals to tell us.\"\n\nPalin also waded into the contentious gun control debate, stating, \"Background checks? Yeah, I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions. More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President \u2013 should have started with yours.\"\n\nOn Mayor Bloomberg's large soda ban, Palin held up a Big Gulp, sipped from a straw, and said, \"Bloomberg is not around, our big gulps are safe. We're cool. Shoot, it's just pop with low-cal ice-cubes in it.\"\n\nPalin also took aim at the political establishment, stating, \"Never before have our challenges been so big and our leaders so small.\" She declined to run for president last year and decided against renewing her contract as a political commentator on Fox News.\n\nOn Saturday, she addressed one of the country's most intractable policy debates: gun control. \"Background checks? Yeah, I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions. More background checks? Dandy idea, Mr. President \u2013 should have started with yours.\"\n\nOn gun ownership, Palin joked about a Christmas gift from her husband, Todd. \"You should have seen what Todd got me for Christmas. Well, it wasn't that exciting. It was a metal rack, case for hunting rifles to put on the back of a four-wheeler. Then though, I had to get something for him to put in the gun case, right. So, this go around, he's got the rifle, I got the rack.\"\n\nPalin also took aim at the current state of politics in Washington, stating, \"We don't have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television.\"\n\nOn young conservatives, Palin offered advice: \"My only piece of advice to our young college Republicans is you've got to be thinking Sam Adams, not drinking Sam Adams. And that's just a joke. I don't want to hear from the CEO of some brewery accusing me of being an anti-beer-ite.\"\n\nOn freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who introduced her, Palin said, \"We need more Americans like Ted Cruz. Coming from Texas, Ted Cruz comes to town, chews barbed wire, and spits out rust.\"\n\nOn Obama administration transparency, Palin stated, \"Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever. Barack Obama, you lie.\"",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee to Hold Confirmation Hearing for John Ratcliffe as Director of National Intelligence\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing for Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, President Trump's nominee for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) position. The hearing, which marks the first major Senate hearing since the coronavirus-induced closures, is scheduled following the Senate's return from its hiatus.\n\nRatcliffe, a member of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Ethics Committees, has been a staunch defender of Trump during the Russia investigation and was part of the president's advisory team during the impeachment proceedings earlier this year. Trump initially considered Ratcliffe for the DNI position last year, but he withdrew his name in August due to concerns about a potentially contentious, partisan confirmation process.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News at the time, Ratcliffe stated, \"I was better served in the position that I am, where I can ask difficult questions of people like the special counsel and [former FBI Director] Jim Comey under oath and shape the investigation that way.\"\n\nTrump re-nominated Ratcliffe in February. Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, is the current acting DNI, a role he assumed after former DNI Dan Coats' resignation last summer. Joseph Maguire was acting DNI until February.\n\nDemocrats' opposition to Grenell could potentially improve Ratcliffe's chances of being confirmed. Earlier this month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., sent Grenell a letter demanding answers regarding organizational changes in his office, including President Trump's recent termination of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\nThe DNI position was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the U.S. intelligence community. The DNI serves on the president's cabinet and acts as an adviser to the president, National Security Council, and Homeland Security Council for national security-related intelligence issues.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, Ratcliffe was often aggressive during the Russia probe and its aftermath, challenging Special Counsel Robert Mueller over his decision to write in his report that he could not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. During a July hearing, Ratcliffe argued, \"The special counsel\u2019s job didn\u2019t say you were to determine Trump\u2019s innocence or to exonerate him. The bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence\u2014everyone is entitled to it, including a sitting president, and because of a presumption of innocence, a prosecutor never, ever needs to determine it.\"\n\nBefore joining Congress, Ratcliffe served as Chief of Anti-Terrorism and National Security for the Eastern District of Texas and as Mayor of Heath, Texas.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Skeptical of President Trump's Denials on Russian Collusion, According to Suffolk/\u2588\u2588\u2588 University Poll\n\nA new poll conducted by Suffolk University reveals a significant lack of trust among Americans in President Donald Trump's denials of collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials. The survey, which polled 1,000 registered voters, found that nearly six in ten respondents have little or no trust in the President's denials, while only 35 percent express some or a lot of trust.\n\nThe poll comes as special counsel Robert Mueller continues to investigate potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as allegations of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors have filed court documents and plea deals in cases involving some of the President's closest associates, including his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who was sentenced last week to three years in prison.\n\nThe skepticism toward Trump sets a challenging landscape for the President even before Mueller submits a report, which may be imminent, examining whether his team conspired with the Russians and if the President attempted to obstruct investigations into those accusations.\n\nThomas Maslany, a 72-year-old retired engineer from Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, expressed his disbelief in the President's version of events. \"I have plenty of evidence that the President lied... starting with the first day of his inauguration with the crowd size,\" Maslany said, adding, \"I know the President's a liar, and I've found no evidence that Mueller is a liar.\"\n\nThe poll found that most respondents, 53 percent, have a lot or some trust in Mueller, while 38 percent have little or no trust in the former FBI director and his investigation to be fair and accurate. In contrast, 59 percent expressed little or no trust in the President's denials, while 35 percent said they have some or a lot of trust in him to speak the truth.\n\nTrump has a core of unwavering supporters who endorse his argument that the Mueller investigation is a \"witch hunt.\" The proportion who say they have \"a lot of trust\" in the President's denials has remained steady since March, at 24 percent then and 24 percent now.\n\nJeff Jacob, an insurance salesman and Trump supporter from Corona, California, called the Mueller inquiry \"a waste of time\" and a case of payback from the political establishment. \"They're doing whatever they can to stick him,\" he said in a follow-up phone interview, though he acknowledged he doesn't like some of the things the President said. \"He shoots his mouth off, but that's probably one of the reasons I voted for him.\"\n\nThe poll also found that 50 percent of respondents believe Russians \"definitely\" interfered in the election to help Trump, while 27 percent say they definitely did not. Nearly as many, 46 percent, say Trump associates \"definitely\" colluded with the Russians, while 29 percent say they definitely did not.\n\nArlanna Spencer, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother from Flagler Beach, Florida, who is a Democrat and voted for Clinton in 2016, said of the Russians, \"I do not think they changed votes (in voting machines); I think they changed minds, and that eventually may have changed votes.\" Spencer added, \"They definitely manipulated people.\"\n\nThe poll, which was taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye warned North Korea that any provocative moves will be met with a \"strong response.\"\n\nPark's comments came after North Korea's latest round of bombastic rhetoric over the weekend, declaring that it had entered a \"state of war\" with the South and labeling the U.S. mainland a \"boiled pumpkin,\" vulnerable to attack. The two Koreas are technically still at war after their conflict in the early 1950s ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n\nThe U.S. has sought to show its willingness to defend its South Korean ally by drawing attention to displays of its military strength during the drills taking place in South Korea. The recent announcements concerning practice flights over South Korea by B-52 bombers and B-2 stealth bombers, both of which can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons, have not been lost on Pyongyang, which has described them as acts of U.S. hostility.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction on North Korean state media Monday to the U.S. statement saying the F-22 Raptors were sent to the main U.S. Air Force Base in South Korea to support air drills in the annual Foal Eagle training exercises there. U.S. and South Korean officials have been trying to strike a balance between acknowledging that the North's rhetoric is cause for concern and at the same time playing down the severity of the threat.\n\nSouth Korea has noted that scores of its workers have continued in recent days to enter and leave the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border. That is despite Pyongyang cutting a key military hotline on the border and threatening to shut down the complex.\n\nThe heightened tensions have prompted North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, to urge the different sides to keep a lid on the situation. The coming weeks appear laced with potential for more bouts of saber-rattling, as North Korean delegates are currently gathered in Pyongyang for the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's rubber stamp parliament. April 15 is the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. That day, the biggest national holiday in North Korea, is usually marked by large-scale parades. Meanwhile, the U.S.-South Korean military exercises that have already stirred so much ire from the North are due to continue until the end of the month.\n\nSome analysts have noted that Pyongyang has carried out some sort of military provocation within weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration. Park, the current president, took office on February 25, five weeks ago.",

Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib Respond to Israel's Ban, Call for Conditional U.S. Aid\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Representatives Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) denounced their exclusion from a planned trip to Israel and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump of conspiring to prevent their fact-finding mission. The two congresswomen, who were barred from entering Israel due to their support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, called for continued U.S. aid to Israel to be contingent on improved conditions for Palestinians.\n\nMs. Omar and Ms. Tlaib, who were scheduled to travel to Israel on Monday, were denied entry last week by Mr. Netanyahu, who claimed their itinerary indicated they were seeking a platform to grandstand rather than engaging in a fact-finding mission. The congresswomen disputed this claim, stating that they had planned to meet with members of the Knesset, Israel's national assembly, and Israeli military veterans advocating for Palestinian self-determination.\n\nA version of their itinerary, obtained by an Israel public broadcaster reporter, showed meetings with several Palestinian activists and international human rights groups but no lawmakers or officials. The congresswomen's trip was organized by Miftah, a nonprofit Palestinian advocacy group that has drawn criticism. They stated they learned of the group from other members of Congress and were surprised at the criticism.\n\nMs. Tlaib, whose family is Palestinian, tearfully shared her experiences with harassment from Israeli authorities despite being a U.S. citizen. Ms. Tlaib was granted an exemption to visit her elderly grandmother but chose not to go, arguing she would be \"caged and bow down.\"\n\nThe congresswomen suggested that Mr. Trump had reached out to Israel to thwart their visit, as the president and the two women have been exchanging barbs for months, with Mr. Trump accusing them of anti-Semitism and the congresswomen leading the push for his impeachment.\n\nIn response to the controversy, the progressive advocacy group Democracy for America called for other members of Congress to refuse to visit Israel in solidarity with the congresswomen. However, Ms. Omar urged lawmakers to visit Israel to witness the conditions of the Palestinians. \"We cannot let Trump and Netanyahu succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us,\" she said.\n\nThe standoff between the U.S. congresswomen and the Israeli government continues, with both sides accusing the other of political grandstanding and obfuscation. The future of U.S.-Israel relations and the fate of Palestinian self-determination remain uncertain as the situation unfolds.",
    " Title: Understanding the Impact of Amazon Rainforest Fires on Global Ecosystem\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with NPR, ecologist Dan Nepstad, president and founder of the Earth Innovation Institute, discusses the immediate and long-term effects of the fires in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nNepstad, who has studied the Amazon for over 30 years, explains the difficulty in determining the true extent of the fires due to their low visibility in intact, virgin forests. He states that the best way to detect forest fires is by the smoke they produce, as open fires or fires burning damaged forests are easier to spot.\n\nThis year, Nepstad notes, is a significant fire year, with the fires burning now being the biggest in the last decade. He attributes this to the persistent fires in felled forests, where giant rainforest trees have been cut down, dried, and burned in preparation for crops or pasture.\n\nNepstad also discusses the threat of large-scale displacement of scrub vegetation, which he describes as deep, dense shade that keeps the litter layer moist and difficult to burn. As this shade dries out and more of it exists, the next fire becomes more intense, killing more trees and eventually allowing grasses and shrubs to take over what was once a pristine forest.\n\nIn terms of solutions, Nepstad suggests a shift from fire-prone systems, such as extensive cattle farming, to more intensive, tree-based systems. This would encourage landholders to invest more in fire prevention and be less likely to use fire to manage their land.\n\nWhen asked about the common description of the Amazon as the \"lungs of the world,\" Nepstad clarifies that it is a bit misleading. Instead, he suggests focusing on the Amazon as a cooling system for the planet, as the rainforest absorbs energy through evaporation, helping to cool the planet. If the Amazon is lost, it will change the way air and energy move around the planet, impacting the global climate.\n\nThe authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.

He expressed uncertainty about whether Congress would find a permanent legislative solution for the program, which is set to expire on March 5. Sessions noted that President Trump's immigration reform plan offers a potential path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million illegal immigrants, but the Senate has stalled on immigration-reform efforts despite open debates on bipartisan and other reform proposals.\n\nRegarding DACA, the program protects an estimated 700,000 immigrants brought illegally to the United States by their parents. Sessions praised Trump's immigration reform plan as \"very generous,\" going beyond what was offered under the Obama-era DACA policy.\n\nSessions also addressed the recent mass shooting at a Florida high school, where 17 people were killed. He met with a group of sheriffs and emphasized the need for law enforcement officials to improve their ability to identify potential mass shooters and act on any signs of danger. Sessions suggested that this was the most valuable step in preventing such tragedies.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Comprehensive Immigration Overhaul, Sending Bill to House for Consideration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill, extending legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants while increasing border security. The bill, which now moves to the House of Representatives, received a vote of 68-32, with all Democrats and 14 Republicans in favor.\n\nThe Senate bill, a significant overhaul of America's immigration system since the 1980s, would legalize millions of currently illegal immigrants, while expanding legal immigration and increasing border security. The legislation is expected to face a chilly reception in the House, where Republican leaders have yet to indicate their stance on the bill.\n\nPresident Obama, who has made immigration legislation a key priority of his second term, hailed the Senate's action, stating, \"Today, the Senate did its job. It's now up to the House to do the same.\" House Speaker John Boehner declined to comment on the bill's future in the House, stating that lawmakers would return from recess and discuss the way forward.\n\nThe Senate bill includes provisions for 20,000 new Border Patrol agents, the completion of 700 miles of fencing, and the deployment of high-tech devices to secure the border with Mexico. Businesses would be required to check the legal status of prospective employees, while a separate program would be established for lower-skilled workers, and farm workers would be admitted under a temporary program.\n\nThe bill's passage in the Senate was the culmination of months of bipartisan negotiations, with the bill's core including numerous steps to prevent future illegal immigration while offering a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants currently living in the country unlawfully.\n\nHowever, the bill's future in the House remains uncertain, with many Republican lawmakers opposing the pathway to citizenship and preferring a piecemeal approach. Critics of the bill, such as Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), have labeled it \"the mother of all amnesties.\" The House Judiciary Committee is currently working on a piece-by-piece effort, with bills on employer checks, high-skilled workers, agriculture workers, and making illegal presence in the country a federal crime already approved.\n\nThe Senate bill's passage in the Senate marks a significant step forward in the ongoing debate over immigration reform, but the ultimate outcome remains uncertain as the bill moves to the House for consideration.",
    " Title: A Critical Examination of Entitlement Programs and Farm Subsidies in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the debate over entitlement programs and farm subsidies continues to be a contentious issue. The Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, has been a point of contention since its inception, with many Americans expressing opposition. However, recent polls suggest that as the possibility of its repeal looms, a significant number of Americans (about half) are reconsidering their stance, expressing a preference for the healthcare reform.\n\nThe resistance to change is not unique to the Affordable Care Act. History has shown that when subsidies or guarantees are involved, people are often willing to fight to maintain them, even when they may be perceived as destructive. For instance, the French job \"protections,\" such as a 35-hour work week, have been criticized for negatively impacting France's economy, yet they remain in place due to public protest.\n\nSimilarly, the termination of subsidies in other countries has led to significant public outcry and unrest. For example, the Mexican government's decision to stop subsidizing gasoline led to severe riots, resulting in casualties.\n\nIn the U.S., farm subsidies have been a long-standing issue. Originally intended as a temporary solution during the Depression to protect against food shortages, they have persisted and grown significantly, from $3 billion to $23.3 billion. Despite the country's food surpluses and the health implications for its citizens, farm subsidies continue to be a significant part of the U.S. budget.\n\nThe U.S. sugar industry is another example of this phenomenon. Sugar quotas, enforced by the government, artificially inflate the price of sweetened products, with Coke being made with corn syrup in America but sugar in most of the world. This system benefits a select few, such as Florida's Fanjul family, who protect their handout through political donations to both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nPeanut subsidies are expected to soon approach the total value of the U.S. peanut crop itself, a statistic that underscores the irrationality of the system. Yet, these subsidies continue unabated.\n\nHistorically, attempts to eliminate or reform such programs have faced significant resistance. For instance, the Clinton administration managed to get rid of the mohair subsidy in 1995, only to see it reinstated five years later. The persistence of these subsidies can be attributed to the powerful lobbying efforts of the recipients, who stand to lose financially if the programs are reformed.\n\nIn contrast, the average citizen, who may pay a little more in taxes or a few pennies more for certain goods, is less likely to engage in political activism. However, the case of Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and his ongoing efforts to eliminate the mohair subsidy serves as a reminder that change is possible, albeit challenging.\n\nEntitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, represent the U.S.'s largest handouts. While these programs are often defended on the grounds that contributions have been made, the reality is that medical bills for Medicare recipients can exceed the amount they have paid in. In essence, Medicare functions as a handout for many.\n\nThe political landscape is complex, with powerful interests protecting their handouts and the average citizen often unaware of the true cost of these programs. However, the success stories of past reforms, such as the elimination of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and gas price regulations during the Ford and Carter administrations, offer a glimmer of hope for those advocating for change.",
    " Title: Police Accountability: A National Crisis Highlighted by the George Floyd Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe arrest and indictment of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd has sparked a national conversation about police accountability. Chauvin, who had 18 complaints over his 19-year tenure, should have been removed from policing duties long ago, as only two of the complaints resulted in discipline. The apparent killing of George Floyd is seen by many as evidence of systemic police abuse, with Minneapolis, like most cities, having a poor record of holding police accountable.\n\nOut of 2,600 complaints since 2012, only 12 resulted in an officer being disciplined, with the most severe penalty being a suspension for 40 hours. The fact that three of Chauvin's colleagues, themselves now indicted, watched as Floyd choked to death is also an indictment of police culture.\n\nThe protests and riots that have followed show the consequences of large segments of the population believing the system is stacked against them. Distrust of government leads to a corrosion of civil society, and the opportunistic looting across the country is rationalized by the logic of nihilism: if police won't follow norms of civilized behavior, then neither will we.\n\nCivil rights leaders have called for a national reckoning to end racism in America. However, the unaccountability of bad cops is caused by a factor largely unrelated to racism. The lack of accountability, according to a Reuters report in 2017, is largely dictated by police union contracts. The standard for discipline is basically harder than for a criminal conviction.\n\nAn officer in Columbus, Ohio, was accused of brutally beating a black college student who was sitting on a bench with friends, for the alleged crime of drinking a beer in public. That officer had been the subject of 40 complaints for misconduct, but Reuters found that, like most bad officers, he could not be dismissed. Why? Union contracts require that prior complaints be expunged from the record, in some jurisdictions after a few months, so it is practically impossible to terminate repeat offenders.\n\nUnion leaders argue that the rules simply \"make sure that due process is given to the officers.\" However, something is obviously wrong with this reasoning: police officers invoke their rights to get away with violating the rights of citizens. Due process is meant to protect against abuses of state power by police and other state agents\u2014not to protect police when they abuse their power.\n\nThe clash of rights means that accountability is basically nonexistent. This is not just a problem with police, but throughout government. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that more than 99% of federal employees received a \"fully successful\" rating.\n\nDemocracy is supposed to be a mechanism for public accountability, but democracy can't function if the links in the chain are broken. We elect governors and mayors, but they have no effective control over police, schools, or other public institutions.\n\nThe organizational flaw here boils down to confusion between liberty and responsibility. Police and other public employees have an affirmative responsibility to serve the public effectively. They must be accountable not by the standards of a criminal trial, but for meeting a much higher standard of public stewardship. It is the job of supervisors to make these judgments.\n\nThe confusion was sown by the Supreme Court in the heyday of Vietnam protests, when the court held that public jobs were akin to a property right and could not be removed without due process. Although the court went out of its way to say that the process could be minimal, due process is a slippery slope.\n\nDue process puts the burden of proof on the supervisor. Fellow workers describe Chauvin as \"tightly wound,\" which is not a good character trait for a cop with a loaded gun. But how does his supervisor prove in a legal hearing that he shouldn't be a cop?\n\nThe tendency is to view accountability as a matter of fairness to the particular person, but what's at stake is the health of our public culture. The harm of no accountability is far greater than a few bad apples. No accountability is like Miracle-Gro for bureaucracy. When people can't be accountable, they find themselves wallowing in red tape dictating exactly how to do things. Rules replace norms. Compliance replaces accomplishment.\n\nPublic service, and especially police work, should be a source of pride and honor, but the absence of accountability leads instead to cynicism and disrespect. A Volcker Commission report on federal civil service in 2003 found deep resentment at \"the protections provided to those poor performers among them who impede their own work and drag down the reputation of all government workers.\"\n\nSafeguards against unfair accountability can readily be provided\u2014for example, by giving veto power to a peer committee. But supervisors can not be put to the proof in a legal proceeding. How do you prove who doesn't try hard, or lacks good judgment or is too tightly wound?\n\nAccountability is not the only change needed to revive trust in American government. Leaders too must be trustworthy. The institutions they lead must display fidelity to accepted norms\u2014not only avoiding abuses of authority, but generally striving to be fair, truthful, and committed to the common good.\n\nWhat's needed is a new social contract with public employees. Instead of a bulletproof sinecure, the core organizing principle must be accountability for the public good.",
    " Title: Obama Expresses Optimism as Budget and Debt Ceiling Negotiations Continue Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs negotiations intensify over the weekend to resolve the ongoing budget and debt ceiling impasse, President Barack Obama expressed hope for a swift resolution to the government shutdown in his weekly address on Saturday. The President stated that it was a positive development that House Republicans have proposed a six-week extension of the nation's borrowing limit.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Obama emphasized that once the debt ceiling is raised and the shutdown is over, there is much that can be accomplished collaboratively. He stated, \"Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it.\"\n\nThe administration has warned that the government will exhaust its authority to pay its bills by Thursday unless Congress agrees to raise the debt limit. The House and Senate are currently working on different proposals to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government, which has been shut down for 12 days. House Republicans have proposed a plan that sets up budget talks, although the administration has not yet accepted it, both sides are still in discussions.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner held a session with GOP lawmakers on Saturday to update them on the status of negotiations. Senate Democrats are considering a plan that would extend the borrowing limit through the 2014 elections, while Senate Republicans are working on a proposal that would increase the borrowing limit until January, end the government shutdown, and delay the Obamacare medical device tax.\n\nRepublicans have accused the President of seeking increased revenue as part of the negotiations, while the President stated in his weekly address that he wants to cut budget deficits \"in a smarter, balanced way that lets us afford to invest in the things we need to grow.\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Chairman Howard \"Buck\" McKeon, a California Republican, urged the President to sign interim measures passed by the House to reopen some government services, including national parks. McKeon stated, \"The House has passed more than a dozen bills providing funding for things we can all agree on\u2014veterans, cancer research, National Guard, national parks, Head Start, food safety, flight safety, border security, nuclear weapon security, and more.\" He added, \"President Obama and Senate Democrats should back these bills immediately.\"\n\nAs talks continue, McKeon called on the President to work with Congress on plans to reopen the entire government and prevent a default on the nation's debts. The ongoing negotiations and their potential impact on the economy continue to be closely watched by both domestic and international observers.",
    " Title: Tokyo Olympics Postponed Until 2021 Amid Global Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled for this summer, have been postponed until the summer of 2021, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Tuesday. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Japanese government have agreed to reschedule the Games to ensure the health and safety of all participants and the international community.\n\nIn a joint statement, the IOC and Abe stated, \"The Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021.\" The statement also confirmed that the Olympic flame will remain in Japan, and the Games will retain their name, Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.\n\nVeteran IOC member Dick Pound had previously suggested that the Games might be postponed, stating on Monday that the event was \"on hold.\" However, the IOC did not confirm or deny this information until Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThe decision to postpone the Olympics comes as the global coronavirus pandemic continues to spread. The IOC began discussions last Sunday to assess the impact of the virus on the Games, with those talks expected to be finalized within the next four weeks.\n\nSeveral countries, including Canada and Australia, have already announced they will not be sending athletes to Tokyo. The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has not yet made a formal announcement regarding the Games.\n\nIn a letter to athletes on Sunday, IOC President Thomas Bach explained the decision and the potential scenarios under consideration, which include modifying the existing operational plans for the Games to start on July 24, 2020, or changing the start date of the Games. Cancellation is not an option, according to the IOC.\n\nThe postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to have significant ramifications, as the Games are one of the world's largest sporting events and a major source of revenue for the IOC. The IOC has not yet provided details on how the rescheduled Games will be financed.\n\nThe IOC and the Japanese government will continue to work closely to finalize the new dates for the Tokyo Olympics and to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants. The Games will serve as a symbol of hope and unity during these challenging times, according to the joint statement.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Stands Firm on Steel and Aluminum Tariffs, Ignoring International and Domestic Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has shown no signs of backing down from its planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, despite a wave of criticism from both domestic and international sources. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that there are currently no country exemptions from the proposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nThe announcement of the tariffs on Thursday has caused market volatility, strained relations with allies, and raised the specter of a potential trade war. While President Trump's rhetoric has primarily focused on China, the tariffs will also affect significant imports from countries such as Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, and the European Union.\n\nThe Pentagon had recommended that Trump pursue targeted tariffs to avoid upsetting American partners abroad. However, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated on ABC's \"This Week\" that the president is not considering such an approach. Ross dismissed threats of retaliation from American allies as \"pretty trivial.\"\n\nTrade politics are often characterized by regional differences, but the debate over the tariffs has opened a significant rift between the president and his own party. Labor unions and liberal Democrats are generally supportive of the tariffs, while Republicans and various business groups warn of potential economic and political consequences if the tariffs are implemented.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) have expressed support for the tariffs, with Brown stating, \"Good, finally,\" and Casey tweeting, \"I urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field.\"\n\nThe unusual alliance between the president and his ideological opposites is a reflection of Trump's clear stance on trade during his campaign. As a candidate, Trump made his populist and protectionist positions on trade quite clear, at times echoing the themes of Democratic presidential candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe candidates in a March 13 House election in Pennsylvania have also embraced the president's plans for tariffs. In a debate that aired on WTAE in Pittsburgh, Democratic candidate Conor Lamb stated, \"For too long, China has been making cheap steel and they've been flooding the market with it. It's not fair and it's not right. So I actually think this is long overdue.\" Republican candidate Rick Saccone agreed, stating, \"Unfortunately, many of our competitors around the world have slanted the playing field, and their thumb has been on the scale. I think President Trump is trying to even that scale back out.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill are largely opposed to the tariff approach. They argue that other industries that rely on steel and aluminum products will suffer, and the cost of new appliances, cars, and buildings will rise if the president follows through. The end result could erode the president's base of support with rural America and even blue-collar workers, the president claims to be trying to help.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-SD) expressed concern, stating, \"There is always retaliation, and typically, these countries single out agriculture when they do that. So, we're very concerned.\" Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI) asked the administration to reconsider its stance, stating that American companies could move their operations abroad and not face retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe Business Roundtable's Josh Bolten, a chief of staff for President George W. Bush, called on Trump to reconsider his stance on trade, stating, \"Sometimes a president needs to, you need to stick to your principles but you also need to recognize in cases where stuff you said in the campaign isn't right and ought to be drawn back.\" Tim Phillips, president of the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, noted that Trump narrowly won in Iowa and Wisconsin, two heavily rural states that could suffer if countries impose retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural goods.\n\nThe president, however, has shown no signs of backing down, tweeting, \"Trade wars are good and easy to win.\" The impact of the tariffs remains to be seen, but the debate is certain to continue as the administration moves forward with its plan.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr to Release Redacted Mueller Report on Russian Election Interference and Trump Campaign Contacts\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General William Barr plans to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign on Thursday, the Justice Department announced on Monday. The report, which Barr has described as nearly 400 pages long, will be released to Congress and the public.\n\nThe Department of Justice spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, did not provide a precise time for the release, but stated that the report will be made available to both Congress and the public. Congressional Democrats have demanded the release of the full report with no redactions and have also asked for the underlying evidence gathered by Mueller, meaning Thursday's action by Barr may be just the first move in a longer fight that could play out in the courts.\n\nMoments after the department announced its plans for releasing the report, the Republican president took to Twitter to make another attack on Mueller's team and derided the \"Russia Hoax.\" The Mueller investigation has cast a shadow over Trump's presidency, who has often called it a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\"\n\nMueller turned over a copy of his confidential report to Barr on March 22, ending his 22-month-long inquiry. Two days later, Barr released a four-page letter summarizing what he said were Mueller's primary conclusions. In that letter to Congress, Barr said Mueller's investigation did not establish that members of Trump's election campaign conspired with Russia.\n\nBarr also wrote that Mueller presented evidence \"on both sides\" about whether Trump obstructed justice by acting to impede the inquiry, but he did not draw a conclusion one way or the other. Barr said that he reviewed Mueller's evidence and made his own determination that Trump did not commit the crime of obstruction of justice.\n\nJustice Department regulations give Barr, a Trump appointee and the top U.S. law enforcement officer, broad authority to decide what to release and what to withhold from the report. Barr has pledged to be as transparent as possible. However, he has said he will redact certain portions for reasons including protecting secret grand jury information, intelligence-gathering sources and methods, information relating to ongoing cases, and the privacy of \"peripheral third parties\" who were not charged.\n\nThe redactions in the report will be color-coded by category, according to Barr, explaining the reasons that parts are blacked out.\n\nAfter Barr released his four-page letter, Trump claimed \"complete and total exoneration,\" condemned \"an illegal takedown that failed,\" and accused unnamed political enemies of treasonous acts. Since Barr released his letter, Trump has set his sights on the FBI, and accused the Justice Department of improperly targeting his campaign. Last week, Barr told a U.S. Senate panel he believed that \"spying\" did occur on Trump's campaign, and he plans to investigate whether it was properly authorized.\n\nBarr's comments were criticized by Democrats, already skeptical of how he has handled the report's release. The attorney general has pledged to testify publicly about the report's conclusions before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on May 1 and 2, respectively. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee voted on April 3 to empower its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to issue subpoenas for the full report and underlying evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Intelligence Committee are also asking Barr to produce all of the investigative materials compiled by Mueller's team and to make Mueller and his staff available for a briefing. In a March 27 letter seen by AP on Monday, Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff and top Republican Devin Nunes told Barr they want Mueller to brief them on \"the investigation's scope and areas of inquiry, its findings, and the intelligence and counterintelligence information gathered\" in the investigation.",
    " Title: Billionaire Casino Owner Sheldon Adelson Emerges as Top Campaign Donor in 2012 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political season marked by unprecedented levels of political spending, billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, stand out as the most prolific campaign donors in the United States. According to people with knowledge of the contribution, the Adelsons recently donated $10 million to Restore Our Future, a super PAC backing the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nThe Adelsons' contributions to super PACs during the 2012 campaign now total at least $35 million, more than twice the amount donated by their closest competitors, billionaire industrialist Harold C. Simmons and his wife, Annette. This makes Mr. Adelson a uniquely powerful force in the annals of presidential politics.\n\nWith a net worth of roughly $25 billion, Mr. Adelson could potentially afford to give far more, and he seems willing to do so. In an interview with Forbes magazine this year, he suggested he would consider spending as much as $100 million on the 2012 elections.\n\nUntil recently, most of the Adelsons' contributions went to Winning Our Future, a super PAC that provided critical support to Newt Gingrich, Romney's rival during the Republican primaries. Winning Our Future spent millions of dollars on advertisements attacking Romney's record at the private equity firm Bain Capital. Mr. Adelson has publicly expressed doubts about Romney, describing him as timid compared with Mr. Gingrich.\n\nHowever, after Mr. Gingrich dropped out in early May, Mr. Romney and Mr. Adelson met for lunch later in the month at Mr. Adelson's Las Vegas hotel, The Venetian. Last week, Politico reported that Mr. Adelson was considering a contribution of $1 million to $10 million to Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super PAC.\n\nMr. Adelson is close to many of Mr. Romney's other supporters, particularly wealthy Jewish donors, with whom he has served on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He also has ties to Restore Our Future; the group's political director, Carl Forti, helped run Freedom's Watch, an issue advocacy group that spent $17 million during the 2008 election.",
    " Title: Huawei Responds to US National Emergency Declaration, Alleges Economic Harm and Job Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the United States' declaration of a national emergency and the subsequent ban on technology from \"foreign adversaries,\" Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, has issued a statement expressing concern over the potential economic and job-related consequences.\n\nThe executive order, signed by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, empowers the government to ban technology and services from foreign entities deemed to pose \"unacceptable risks\" to national security. The order, which does not name specific countries or companies, comes after months of pressure on Huawei from the US government.\n\nHuawei, in a statement reported by the state-run Global Times, stated, \"If the US restricts Huawei, it will not make the US safer, nor will it make the US stronger. It will only force the US to use inferior and expensive alternative equipment, lagging behind other countries... and ultimately harming US companies and consumers.\"\n\nThe company also expressed a willingness to \"communicate with the US to ensure product security,\" echoing reassurances given to the UK.\n\nThe US Commerce Department has added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its \"entity list,\" effectively banning the company from acquiring components and technology from US firms without government approval. The move is part of a broader effort to protect the US supply chain from \"foreign adversaries\" in the information and communications technology and services sector.\n\nThe US and China have recently increased tariffs in a trade dispute over what US officials call China's unfair trade practices. Talks between Washington and Beijing have stalled, causing volatility amid concerns about a global trade war.\n\nChina has emphasized that the concept of national security should not be abused and has criticized the US actions against specific Chinese companies as disgraceful and unjust. The Chinese government has also announced plans to increase tariffs on nearly $60bn worth of US imports beginning on 1 June.\n\nHuawei has strongly denied US allegations that its equipment could be used by the Chinese state to spy. The company's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, has claimed that Huawei would reject any efforts to gather intelligence through its products, even if the Chinese government required it to do so.\n\nThe US government has barred the US government from using equipment from Huawei and another Chinese provider, ZTE Corp, since August 2019. The export restriction is expected to place US and Chinese companies at new risk, according to analysts. Huawei has stated that the decision will affect tens of thousands of American jobs and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.",
    " Title: Exploring Potential Scenarios for the Future of Roe v. Wade in the New Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent appointment of two justices by former President Donald Trump has sparked discussions about the potential future of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in the United States. While it's crucial to acknowledge the apprehensions of those who support abortion rights, it's essential to understand that the overturning of Roe v. Wade is not the only, or even the most likely, outcome.\n\nThis article aims to outline several possible scenarios that could unfold in the Supreme Court regarding Roe v. Wade. Let's begin by discussing the most extreme and least likely scenarios, which we'll refer to as the nuclear options.\n\nThe first nuclear option would involve the Supreme Court flipping Roe v. Wade on its head. Instead of recognizing a constitutional right to abortion, the court could rule that the Constitution prohibits abortion in the interest of protecting fetal life. This would effectively outlaw abortions across the nation, making it illegal for women to obtain the procedure within the United States.\n\nA second nuclear option would entail the court doing away with the right to privacy established in the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut. The right to privacy is the foundation for Roe v. Wade. If the right to privacy is abolished, it would eradicate the basis for Roe v. Wade, flipping the issue back to the states, and allowing them to regulate abortion as they see fit.\n\nA second possibility, and the one that is currently the subject of much discussion, is the court overruling Roe v. Wade. In a post-Roe world, individuals would still have a right to privacy, but that right would not include a constitutional right to abortion. States would be free to regulate abortion as they wish, and some advocacy groups estimate that perhaps 22 states could make abortion illegal entirely.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this scenario is not likely to occur anytime soon. Chief Justice John Roberts is known for his incremental approach, and it's unlikely his first impulse would be to overrule Roe v. Wade when there are other ways to achieve many of the same goals.\n\nThe last, and most likely, scenario is for the court to chip away at Roe v. Wade. The court has already upheld some restrictions on abortion, and it's imaginable that they will continue to do so in the future. States could impose restrictions on abortion that are not considered an undue burden on women's right to the procedure. This could lead to a rapid diminishment of the ability of women to obtain abortions, particularly in states with conservative majorities.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's essential to remain vigilant and informed about the potential changes to Roe v. Wade, it's crucial to understand that the most extreme scenarios are unlikely. The Supreme Court is more likely to chip away at Roe v. Wade, imposing restrictions on abortion that could make it more difficult for women, particularly those in red states and those of lower income, to obtain the procedure.",
    " Title: Hobby Lobby Allegedly Fires Pregnant Employee, Sparks Controversy Over Workplace Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by RH Reality Check, Hobby Lobby, a well-known arts and crafts retailer, is under scrutiny for allegedly firing a pregnant employee after she requested time off to give birth. The employee, Felicia Allen, claimed that despite assurances from her supervisor that her job would be waiting for her upon her return, she was terminated after giving birth.\n\nAllen, who started as a part-time cashier at Hobby Lobby in 2010, found out she was pregnant not long after she started. Concerned about her job security, she asked her supervisor if her job would be safe even though she had not been working at the chain long enough to qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act.\n\n\"I asked her would I lose my job due to me being four months and only having five months before I have my child. She told me \u2018no,\u2019\" Allen told RH Reality Check. \"I felt like everything was OK. I had talked to my boss, and she let me know that everything would be OK. I would still have my job.\"\n\nHowever, when Allen was ready to have her child, she was fired. She said she tried to come back three weeks after she gave birth, but was not rehired as she was assured she would be.\n\n\"I was like, I can\u2019t get fired,\" Allen said. \"She can\u2019t terminate me because I have to go have my child. I started asking everybody on the job, \u2018Can they do this?\u2019 And even the assistant manager who had just got hired [said], \u2018No, that\u2019s not right.\u2019\"\n\nIn addition to being misled about being able to return to her job, Allen said Hobby Lobby fought her on unemployment benefits. According to Allen, the company said she could have taken personal leave but opted not to. Allen eventually won her claim, but she left her experience at Hobby Lobby feeling that the company had discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.\n\nThe allegations against Hobby Lobby are significant, as the company has long been known for its pro-family Christian principles. In a promotional video on the Hobby Lobby website, company president Steve Green explained how these principles are integral to the company's operations.\n\n\"Well, the beliefs that we\u2019ve had\u2014that we have grown up with all our lives\u2014are convictions that we have that we live by personally,\" Green said. \"And as we have ran our business, we feel the obligation or the desire that we want to use those same principles within our business. It would not be consistent for us to live one way at home and then accept a different way at work. That would be inconsistent with our faith.\"\n\nHobby Lobby has not yet responded to a request for comment, and it remains to be seen how the Green family, who are known for their pro-family Christian principles, will respond to these allegations. The case highlights the complexities of balancing religious beliefs with employment practices, and the potential consequences for employees when those beliefs are prioritized over legal protections.",
    " Title: U.S. Court Temporarily Halts Implementation of DAPA Program, Leaving DACA in Place\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the United States District Court for the Southern Division of Texas has issued a temporary injunction against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from implementing any aspects of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans or Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. What did the court do?\nU.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen entered an Order of Temporary Injunction, preventing DHS from implementing any aspect of President Obama's \"DAPA Memorandum,\" which includes an expansion of Obama's June 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This means that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office may not begin accepting new DACA applications as it was scheduled to do this week, and if the order holds, may not begin accepting DAPA applications as it was scheduled to this May. As a result, an estimated four million illegal immigrants will not be given work permits, drivers' licenses, or Social Security numbers as Obama originally envisioned.\n\n2. What didn't the court do?\nThis is only a temporary injunction that preserves the status quo until a more thorough court proceeding can rule on the merits of the case. The court's order does not affect the existing DACA program.\n\n3. What happens next?\nThe White House has indicated that it will appeal Judge Hanen's order. This appeal will be heard by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit, who could issue a decision around July or August of this year. If the Obama administration loses that ruling, it could then appeal for an en banc ruling from the 5th Circuit before then appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\n4. How does this affect the DHS funding debate in Congress?\nThe impact on the DHS funding debate is uncertain. Speaker John Boehner issued a statement Tuesday urging \"Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach\" to now \"let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department.\" The statement is a direct shot at Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Al Franken (D-MN), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Angus King (I-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) all of whom have questioned the legality of Obama's amnesty but have voted to prevent any debate on the House Department of Homeland Security bill that defunds Obama's amnesty programs.\n\nSince the order leaves the existing DACA program in place, while preventing the new DAPA program from being implemented, it is possible a compromise could be reached by both parties where the DHS bill would continue to defund the DAPA program, but Democratic Senators could offer amendments preserving DACA program. Moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has floated exactly such a compromise.",
    " Title: Senate Cancels Half of Summer Recess to Accelerate Legislative Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday the cancellation of nearly half of the Senate's summer vacation, keeping lawmakers in Washington to make progress on President Trump's legislative agenda. The decision comes as the Senate grapples with passing a budget, repealing Obamacare, and beginning work on tax reform, while also addressing a backlog of presidential nominations.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, criticized the move, suggesting that Republicans are trying to mask their legislative failures. \"They're struggling with health care. They don't want to go home and face their constituents,\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nThe decision to cancel vacation is a significant shift for lawmakers who value their time away from Washington. However, Mr. McConnell argued that Democrats' opposition has made it difficult for the Senate to conduct business. \"There are other things that we have to do, and we only have a limited number of days left,\" Mr. McConnell said. \"We intend to fully utilize the first two weeks in August.\"\n\nThe Senate has faced criticism for its slow pace in confirming President Trump's nominees, with only 46 of the 178 nominations confirmed so far. This is significantly lower than the number of nominees confirmed by President Obama at the same point in his first term, according to Mr. McConnell.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, did not view the recess announcement as a desperate move. \"I have no problem with it whatsoever,\" he said. \"I would have liked to [have] stayed in last week, quite honestly, to have greater input in terms of what the final Senate bill was.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives has not yet announced whether they will follow suit, but are under increasing pressure from conservatives to work through the summer. The House Freedom Caucus issued a statement, saying, \"It is imperative that the additional weeks are coupled with decisive action.\"\n\nSenators will spend this week and next rewriting and debating the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare. After that, they will turn to the annual defense policy bill and could move to raise the federal government's borrowing limit. Analysts say that must be accomplished by October. Congress also faces a Sept. 30 deadline to approve funding for basic government operations in fiscal year 2018, and Republicans need to pass a new budget to streamline the process for tax reform.",
    " Title: \"Democrats Lose Senate Majority: A Look at the 2014 Midterm Election and the Democrats' Struggles\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the Democrats have lost their majority in the Senate following the 2014 midterm elections. The closely contested races that would determine the shape of President Barack Obama's last two years in office have resulted in a Republican-controlled Senate, marking the first time in eight years that the GOP holds the majority.\n\nThe campaign, which saw Democrats unable to capitalize on opportunities and cope with long-planned challenges, was marked by a series of state-level missteps. From the bitter feud between Democratic leaders over their candidate in South Dakota, to a fumbled Democratic recruitment in Montana, a flawed Democratic candidate in Iowa, and a failure to capitalize on a weak Republican in Georgia, the Democrats struggled to gain momentum.\n\nThe Republicans, on the other hand, capitalized on the \"six-year itch\" of Obama's second term, where the president's party traditionally gets pummeled. They sent a deliberate, don't-mess-with-incumbents message, and their opposition research hit pay dirt with the plagiarism allegations against Democratic Sen. John Walsh in Montana.\n\nThe Democrats' inability to escape the \"Obama factor\" was a significant hurdle. The Obamacare website debacle, the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal, the rise of ISIL, the Ebola epidemic, the tidal wave of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border, and the crisis over Russia's actions in Ukraine kept Obama front and center in the news, exactly where Democrats on Capitol Hill didn't want him.\n\nSenate Democrats and the White House have their own gripes about the election. Senate Democrats blundered time and again by being too frightened to do anything, mishandling their relationship with Obama, while candidates foolishly ran from a president they were going to be tied to anyway. The White House, in turn, argues that they were prevented from making their argument due to a lack of cooperation from the Senate Democrats.\n\nThis account draws from multiple interviews with key Democratic and Republican officials involved in the decision-making that helped shape the 2014 midterm elections. They told the same story in the closing days of the races: This midterm cycle was run largely out of Washington, and was defined by missed opportunities.",
    " Title: Trump to Impose Tariffs on $200 Billion in Chinese Goods as Early as Next Week\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to impose tariffs on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese goods as early as next week, according to a senior administration official. This move escalates the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe White House is expected to announce the 10% tariff rate on the $200 billion list of goods, but the rate could potentially increase to 25%, as Trump proposed last month. The administration has been threatening these tariffs for months as a response to China's policies that lead to intellectual property theft or mandated technology transfers on U.S. companies operating in China.\n\nThe public comment period on Trump's latest set of tariffs concluded last week, paving the way for the president to follow through on his threat. In the past, the administration has analyzed public comments before implementing announced tariffs, which currently affect about $53 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nHowever, Trump's recent comments suggest he is eager to implement his plan without delay. This has been met with pressure from American businesses, who have urged Trump to consider the impact of the tariffs on consumers, particularly during the holiday season.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this month, the National Retail Federation and 150 other business groups stated, \"Continuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more U.S. economic interests, including farmers, families, businesses, and workers.\"\n\nTrump has also threatened to impose tariffs on virtually all $505 billion that the U.S. imports from China. \"I hate to say that, but behind that, there\u2019s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last week.\n\nDespite the ongoing trade dispute, Trump and Chinese leaders are planning to resume trade talks later this month. Trump maintained his tough stance on China earlier this week, tweeting, \"We are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?\"\n\nA White House spokeswoman confirmed Trump's intention to move ahead with the tariffs in response to a Bloomberg report that stated Trump had instructed aides to prepare to impose them. \"The President has been clear that he and his administration will continue to take action to address China\u2019s unfair trade practices. We encourage China to address the long-standing concerns raised by the United States,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said on Friday.\n\nBeijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs ranging from 5 to 25% on an additional $60 billion in U.S. products as soon as the Chinese tariffs are imposed. So far, China has responded in kind to Trump's tariffs, imposing an equivalent $53 billion in tariffs on U.S. exports to China, much of which has been U.S. agricultural goods. However, the U.S. exports only about $130 billion in goods, meaning China may need to look beyond tariffs to retaliate against Trump's latest trade action.\n\nNews of Trump's plans to proceed on tariffs on $200 billion in goods as early as next week was first reported by The Washington Post.",
    " Title: Foreign Workers, Journalists Face Increased Threats in Afghanistan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past month, Afghanistan has witnessed a series of attacks targeting foreign workers and journalists, reminiscent of insider attacks that posed a significant challenge to the military training mission two years ago.\n\nLess than three weeks ago, award-winning photographer Anja Niedringhaus, a German citizen, was killed by a police officer at a checkpoint in eastern Afghanistan. Her Canadian colleague, Kathy Gannon, a long-time reporter for The Associated Press, was also wounded in the attack. A month before that, a Swedish journalist was shot and killed in a heavily guarded area of Kabul.\n\nMore recently, Dr. Jerry Umanos, a pediatrician from Chicago, was killed.\n\nThese incidents echo the violence perpetrated by Afghan security forces against their Western allies, which was a crisis in 2018. However, with international coalition soldiers confined to their bases and new strategies in place to prevent insider attacks, such episodes have decreased. Instead, foreign workers in Afghanistan have become the primary targets, although the number of Western civilians targeted is still significantly lower than military deaths, and both combined are far outnumbered by Afghan civilian casualties in the war.\n\nBefore the April 5 presidential election, the Taliban showed a concerted effort to target locations popular with expatriates. An assault in January on a restaurant in central Kabul, the Taverna du Liban, left 21 people dead, most of them foreigners. Shootings at the luxury Serena Hotel last month claimed nine lives. These events have put the thousands of foreigners living in Kabul on high alert.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the violence has led some embassies to strengthen their security measures, and those living outside secure areas have limited their exposure.\n\nDr. Umanos' friends and colleagues said he was well-aware of the risks but was drawn to working with Afghans and helping to teach a new generation of doctors in the country. \"He was a very good teacher and clinician,\" said Robert F. Werner, who lived in the same house as Dr. Umanos in Afghanistan. \"And he also had a great sense of humor, so culturally, he just did well. The doctors loved working with him.\"",
    " Title: Unprecedented Praise for President Trump's D-Day Anniversary Speech from CNN's Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, two of President Donald Trump's most vocal critics from mainstream media, CNN's Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, praised the President's speech commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nFollowing the speech, Acosta, a White House correspondent for CNN, commended Trump's adherence to his script and the message he delivered. \"This is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump's presidency today,\" Acosta said on CNN. \"We were all wondering if he would veer from his remarks, go off of his script, but he stayed on script, stayed on message, and, I think, rose to the moment.\"\n\nAcosta's praise for Trump's speech comes amidst controversy surrounding his upcoming book, \"The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,\" which is billed as an \"explosive, first-hand account of the dangers [Acosta] faces reporting on the current White House while fighting on the front lines in President Trump's war on truth.\"\n\nOn MSNBC, Scarborough, a recurrent Trump critic, echoed Acosta's sentiments. \"Donald Trump delivered what, again, I believe is the strongest speech of his presidency,\" Scarborough said, noting that it was a \"beautiful moment\" when Trump acknowledged the sacrifices of the D-Day heroes.\n\nViewers on both liberal networks were presumably taken aback, as Acosta and Scarborough typically criticize Trump's actions. The pair's praise for Trump's D-Day speech marks a departure from their usual condemnation of the President.\n\nThe authors of \"Unmasked \u2014 Big Media's War Against Trump,\" L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham of the Media Research Center, recently named Acosta the media member who \"hates\" Trump the most. \"He would proudly wear the moniker of the face of the Resistance if it was bestowed on him by us, but we won't do that. No man in the world of journalism has made a mockery of his profession quite like this man,\" Bozell and Graham wrote.\n\nMSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" duo Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski share the second spot on the list of media members who clearly loathe the President. The married co-hosts were once close to Trump but have since turned critical. Despite their regular criticism of the President, Scarborough had nothing but positive remarks about Trump's D-Day speech.",
    " Title: NSA Taps into Google and Yahoo Data Networks, Alleges New Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that has sparked controversy and raised privacy concerns, a new report from The Washington Post claims that the National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly tapped into the unencrypted links behind massive cloud networks operated by companies like Google and Yahoo. The operation, known as Operation MUSCULAR, is said to have collected data from hundreds of millions of user accounts, including emails, videos, and audio from American citizens.\n\nThe report alleges that the NSA, in collaboration with its British counterpart, GCHQ, relies on an unnamed telecommunications provider outside of the U.S. to offer secret access to a cable or switch through which Google and Yahoo pass unencrypted traffic between their servers.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo have strict security measures in place for their servers, with Google's facilities reportedly guarded around the clock by trained personnel, and secured with heat-sensitive cameras, biometric verification, and more. However, the NSA's alleged infiltration of these networks overseas has been met with silence from White House officials and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nIn response to the allegations, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander stated on Wednesday that the agency does not access such networks without a court order. The NSA also released a statement asserting that it only uses attorney general-approved processes in data collection and does not collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo have issued statements expressing concern over the alleged government interception of traffic between their data centers. Google stated that it is not aware of this activity, while Yahoo maintains strict controls in place to protect the security of its data centers and denies giving access to its data centers to the NSA or any other government agency.\n\nIn June, President Obama stated unequivocally that the NSA cannot and has not listened to the telephone calls nor targeted the emails of a U.S. person. The full details of the NSA spying scandal can be found in The Washington Post's latest report.",
    " Title: US States Gradually Lift Lockdown Orders as Experts Warn Against Premature Relaxation\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several states have begun to lift lockdown orders, despite warnings from health officials that premature relaxation could lead to a second wave of infections.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. saw its largest single-day spike in cases, but the infection rate has dropped significantly in several hotspots, including New York, the U.S. epicenter. As of Tuesday, the U.S. has over 994,000 recorded coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, and more than 56,700 deaths.\n\nThe decision to end mandatory orders comes as over 26 million Americans seek unemployment protection, and the jobless rate climbs to around 16% of the population. Even as state governors allow orders to expire, some city mayors have issued their own separate plans to end local lockdown rules.\n\nAt one point, over 90% of the U.S. population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but some states began lifting orders over the weekend, allowing some Americans to return to hair salons and tattoo parlors. Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, and South Carolina have already allowed some businesses to reopen, with more states set to follow suit in the coming week.\n\nColorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis has announced that kerb-side retail pickup can begin on Monday, with hair salons, barbershops, and tattoo parlors allowed to reopen on Friday. Tennessee will allow restaurants to reopen on Monday, the same day that Mississippi's mandatory lockdown order expires. Montana's governor has allowed churches to reopen starting on Sunday, with social distancing measures still required. Restaurants and schools will be allowed to reopen on 7 May.\n\nEight states led by Republican governors - Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming - never issued mandatory orders to stay at home. Michigan's Democratic governor, who has angered protesters with her lockdown orders, told ABC News that it is too early to lift mandatory orders in the state.\n\n\"We've got to be nimble and we have to follow the science and be really smart about how we reengage,\" said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Despite a state-wide order to stay-at-home in California, thousands of people have flocked to beaches amid a heat wave.\n\nHowever, officials in both Ventura and Orange Counties, where beaches are open, said most people were adhering to social distancing guidelines, including staying 6ft (2m) apart. Many beaches are still closed, leading the sheriff of LA County to warn beach-goers that \"enforcement is in full effect.\"\n\nTexas' governor said he will not renew the state's stay-at-home order when it expires on 30 April because it \"has done its job.\" Republican Greg Abbott said on Monday that retail business, as well as restaurants, cinemas, and malls can reopen - but at only 25% capacity - starting on Friday. Barbershops, hair salons, pubs, and gyms can not reopen until later in May, the governor said.\n\nOhio Republican Governor Mike DeWine, who has been praised for his virus response, said that non-essential surgery that does not require an overnight hospital stay can resume on 1 May. On 4 May, offices can reopen, and on 12 May, retail business can resume.\n\n\"These are first steps,\" Mr. DeWine said. \"We've got to get moving.\"\n\nOn Sunday, White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said social distancing will remain the norm \"through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.\" Her comments come after Vice-President Mike Pence said the virus would be largely \"behind us\" by the 25 May Memorial Day holiday, which signals the unofficial start of summertime in the U.S.\n\nDr. Birx told Fox News this weekend that new cases and deaths \"will be dramatically decreased by the end of May.\" On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested some parts of his state could begin to reopen after the current stay-at-home order expires on 15 May. The governor said that transmission rates, as well as death rates, would dictate how and when the state reopens.\n\nHe urged local officials to follow national health guidelines for reopening and work together regionally, saying: \"You have to be smart about it - we all have to be smart about it.\" Mr. Cuomo also noted he would extend restrictions in many parts of the state. There are still 1,000 new Covid-19 cases confirmed each day in New York. The death rate has dropped in New York, with 337 deaths on Sunday, compared to 367 deaths on Saturday and 437 on Friday. It represents the lowest increase since 30 March.",
    " Title: Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down North Carolina's Voting Restrictions: A Landmark Decision and a Potential Swing for the Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a federal appeals court has struck down North Carolina's voting restrictions, some of the strictest in the nation. This decision comes after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling against Texas' Voter ID laws and a federal district court's injunction against Wisconsin's.\n\nDale Ho, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer who argued the case in North Carolina, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"This is a huge victory.\" He added, \"The tide is turning.\"\n\nIn 2016, new voting restrictions were set to block over 1.3 million voters in four swing states\u2014Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014primarily by eliminating early voting periods and requiring specific forms of identification. North Carolina's 2016 law alone affected more than 1.2 million people, with 900,000 people utilizing early voting in 2012, 130,000 using same-day registration in 2008, and over 200,000 registered voters not having driver's licenses. As of today, these votes are back in play.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit didn't just strike down North Carolina's new rules. The three-judge panel wrote an opinion filled with fiery rhetoric that condemned the state legislature for acting with discriminatory intent. The opinion noted that \"after years of preclearance and expansion of voting access, by 2013 African American registration and turnout rates had finally reached near-parity with white registration and turnout rates. African Americans were poised to act as a major electoral force.\"\n\nHowever, the state, after the Supreme Court ruled that part of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional in 2013, \"requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans\u2026 Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist.\"\n\nThese are unusually strong words, both in ordinary language and in legalese. It's not just that North Carolina's law happens to affect communities of color\u2014the Court found that it was intended to do so all along.\n\nThat's different from the Fifth Circuit's finding that Texas' Voter ID law had a disparate impact on minority communities. It's actually calling out North Carolina for racial discrimination.\n\nDoes that mean that North Carolina's legislators are racist? Not quite.\n\n\"Discriminatory intent means singling out a group on the basis of race and trying to disadvantage them on that basis,\" Ho explained. \"It doesn't matter if you hate black voters, or don't like how black voters vote. If you're targeting them, that is discrimination.\"\n\nThat, the appeals court found, is exactly what North Carolina did. Inventing a voter fraud crisis that didn't exist, the state \"required in-person voters to show certain photo IDs, beginning in 2016, which African Americans disproportionately lacked, and eliminated or reduced registration and voting access tools that African Americans disproportionately used.\"\n\nAll this correlation, the court ruled, couldn't be an accident. There was no smoking gun\u2014no careless comment about disenfranchising black voters\u2014but the way the gun was loaded, aimed, and fired left no doubt about the law's purpose.\n\n\"The only clear factor linking these various'reforms' is their impact on African American voters,\" the court held. \"The record thus makes obvious that the'problem' the majority in the General Assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party.\"\n\nThe cases in Wisconsin, Texas, and North Carolina represent a sea change in judicial opinion about voting restrictions. And with challenges pending in Ohio, Virginia, and Kansas, it seems like voter suppression's days may be numbered.\n\nHo told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that public opinion is shifting as well.\n\n\"When these laws first got passed, people thought 'what's the big deal\u2014I have ID.' But the truth is that while 90 percent of us do have ID, 10 percent don't\u2026 and it's those folks that these laws target. Not everyone has the same advantages that we have or lives in the same circles.\"\n\nIn the meantime, North Carolina's photo ID requirement, changes to early voting, same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting, and preregistration have all been put on hold. A million more voters will now go to the polls.\n\nAnd while the state could appeal, Ho said, \"I don't like their odds.\"",
    " Title: New Polls Show Tight Race in Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin as Presidential Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest polls conducted by Quinnipiac University/CBS News/The New York Times, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney are running neck-and-neck in three critical battleground states: Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The polls indicate that Obama has a slight edge in each of the three states, with 49% of likely voters in Florida supporting Obama, compared to 46% who back Romney. In Ohio, 50% of likely voters back Obama, while 44% support Romney. In Wisconsin, Obama has the backing of 49% of likely voters, compared to 47% who support Romney.\n\nThe numbers reflect only a tiny boost for Romney since he named Paul Ryan as his running mate at the beginning of August. In Florida, support for Romney ticked up one percentage point from a poll taken before Ryan was added to the ticket, and in Wisconsin, Romney inched up two percentage points. The Ohio numbers remained identical to a Quinnipiac University survey taken prior to the Paul Ryan announcement.\n\nThursday's poll in Wisconsin was the third survey since Romney announced Ryan as his running mate showing a tight race in the Badger State. On Wednesday, a Marquette Law School poll showed Obama at 49% and Romney at 46%, and last week a CNN/ORC poll indicated Obama at 49% among registered voters in Wisconsin while Romney was at 45%.\n\n\"Mitt Romney's pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has made some small difference in Florida and Wisconsin, at least at this point, when voters in these three key states are asked about their presidential vote,\" Peter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, wrote in a statement accompanying the poll's release.\n\nCompared to Vice President Joe Biden, Ryan was seen in a more favorable light. In Florida, the House Budget chairman had a 29% unfavorable rating, compared to 44% for Biden. In Ohio, 27% of voters had an unfavorable impression of Ryan, compared to 40% for Biden. And in Wisconsin, Ryan's home state, the GOP vice presidential candidate had a 35% unfavorable rating, compared to 42% for Biden.\n\nForty-one percent of voters in Florida said Biden was qualified to become president, compared to 37% who said the same of Ryan. In Ohio, 43% said Biden was qualified, compared to 32% who said the same of Ryan. Forty-one percent of Wisconsin voters said Biden was qualified, compared to 44% who thought Ryan had the qualifications to be president.\n\n\"Voters see Ryan in a more favorable light than they do Vice President Joseph Biden,\" Brown wrote. \"And when voters assess the two running mates' qualifications to become president, Biden is only slightly ahead in Florida and Ohio and slightly behind the seven-term congressman in Wisconsin. In fact, Ryan's qualified/unqualified ratio is better than Biden's.\"\n\nMedicare, the government-run health care program for senior citizens, is popular in all three states. The issue surfaced as a major issue on the presidential campaign trail when Romney named Ryan as his running mate, since Ryan has proposed a plan in the House that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange.\n\nRyan says the plan would save Medicare from insolvency, but Democrats say it would amount to a \"gutting\" of the program that would result in higher costs. Thursday's polls showed a majority of voters in the three battleground states saying they thought Medicare should continue operating the way it currently does, with the government providing insurance to seniors. Strong majorities also said they thought Medicare was worth the cost to taxpayers.\n\n\"By more than 4-1 margins, voters in each state say the health care program for the elderly is worth the cost and six in 10 say they favor keeping the current Medicare model,\" Brown wrote. \"But 10% of voters in each state would support'major reductions' in Medicare to reduce the deficit and almost 50% would support'minor reductions.'\"\n\nThe Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll was conducted by telephone between August 15 \u2013 21. In Florida, 1,241 likely voters were polled; in Ohio, 1,253 were polled, and in Wisconsin, 1,190 were polled. The sampling error in all three states was plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

    " Title: Illinois Voter Challenges Ted Cruz's Eligibility for Presidential Nomination in Court\n\nArticle:\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 A voter in Illinois has filed a lawsuit against Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, alleging that he is not a \"natural-born citizen\" and should be disqualified for the party's nomination. The case will be heard in the Circuit Court of Cook County in Chicago on Friday.\n\nLawrence Joyce, an Illinois voter who previously objected to Cruz's placement on the Illinois primary ballot next month, will have his case heard before Judge Maureen Ward Kirby. Joyce's initial objection, made to the state's Board of Elections, was dismissed on February 1. He appealed the decision and was granted a hearing for Friday.\n\nJoyce's lawsuit challenges Cruz's right to be president in the wake of questions raised by GOP rival Donald Trump about being born in Canada. Cruz maintains he is a natural-born citizen since his mother is American-born.\n\n\"What I fear is that Ted Cruz becomes the nominee, come September, Congressman Alan Grayson of Florida will go forward with his threats and probably several other Democrats will file suit to prevent Ted Cruz from being on the ballot,\" Joyce, a pharmacist and attorney from Poplar Grove, Ill, told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nGrayson, a Democrat, has stated that he will file a lawsuit contesting Cruz's citizenship if the senator from Texas wins the GOP nomination.\n\n\"What Democrats will do at that point is cherry pick which county courthouse they are going to show up in order to file these petitions,\" Joyce said. \"And at that point, I fear they'll get a string of victories in the lower courts and the funding for Ted Cruz would dry up, his numbers would plummet in the polls, he may be forced to give up the nomination.\"\n\nJoyce, who is backing Republican contender Ben Carson, said he has not spoken to the Trump campaign. However, Joyce did say he raised the issue with the Carson campaign, which he said was uninterested in pursuing the matter.\n\nThe Illinois man said he was hesitant to file the lawsuit out of concern that getting involved in such a high-profile case could be detrimental to his own law practice.\n\n\"I tried to talk myself out of it and was unable to do so,\" Joyce said. \"It's plain as day that Ted Cruz is not a natural-born citizen of the United States.\"\n\nAt a CNN-hosted town hall meeting Wednesday night, Cruz defended his citizenship and right to run, stating that he was born in Canada to a U.S. citizen, making him an automatic U.S. citizen. His mother was born in Wilmington, Del., Cruz said.\n\n\"I never breathed a breath of air on this planet when I was not a U.S. citizen,\" he said. \"The act of being born made me a U.S. citizen.\"\n\nHe added: \"There will be some who try to work political mischief on it, but as a legal matter, this is clear and straightforward.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Rick Tyler had no comment about the lawsuit, and the Trump campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nA federal lawsuit was filed in Texas last month asking for a determination of Cruz's eligibility to run. Voters in New York, who raised similar concerns about Cruz's citizenship, on Thursday filed a challenge with the state Board of Election challenging the senator's eligibility to be on the ballot.\n\nSanford Levinson, constitutional law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Joyce would have to prove standing \u2013 or why Cruz's potential ineligibility affects him specifically \u2013 for the judge to proceed with the case.\n\nEven if the judge declares Cruz to be ineligible to run, the GOP candidate's campaign would undoubtedly file an appeal, potentially tying the case up for months, he said.\n\n\"I'd be very, very surprised if [the judge] were to say he's ineligible,\" Levinson said. \"At that point, all hell would break loose.\"",
    " Title: Libertarian Party Ticket Gains Momentum as General Election Approaches, Aiming for Debate Stage and Presidential Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race moves into full swing, the Libertarian Party ticket, led by nominee Gary Johnson and running mate William Weld, is experiencing a surge in support and interest. This surge could potentially place Johnson on the highly coveted debate stage this fall, as polls show him nearing the 15 percent threshold required to participate in the debates.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average, Johnson currently stands at 8.4 percent in a four-way race with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. This is a significant increase from the 4.5 percent he was polling at in June. The latest \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll, released Wednesday, places Johnson at 12 percent.\n\nThe Libertarian Party is capitalizing on the unpopularity of the major-party candidates, with Chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, Nicholas Sarwark, stating, \"It goes from week to week and day to day watching for what new thing [Clinton and Trump] are going to do to become more unpopular with the American people.\"\n\nSarwark emphasized Johnson's credentials as a two-term New Mexico governor, re-elected as a Republican in a Democratic state, to tout his qualifications and appeal. However, it remains uncertain whether the polling support will translate into votes at the ballot box. In 2012, Johnson won just 0.99 percent of all votes cast, making him the most successful White House candidate in Libertarian history, but not making much of a dent in the race as a whole.\n\nThis year, there are signs that more voters are seeking an alternative candidate. At the Democratic convention last week, many Bernie Sanders supporters were reportedly getting on board with the Green Party's Stein. However, Johnson is currently polling the best among third-party candidates.\n\nJohnson and Weld generated some buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad listing their accomplishments. Johnson believes that in addition to appealing to disenfranchised Republicans on issues like free trade, low taxes, and smaller government, the Libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could bring Sanders voters on board.\n\nThe party is banking on Johnson's ability to introduce himself to voters not familiar with his story, especially if he is able to get on the debate stage. So far, while Johnson's support is higher than in past years, an 8.4 percent average is still a distance from the 15 percent he'd need to make the debates. He has until the middle of September to hit 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nEven if Johnson reaches the debate stage, the record for third-party or independent candidates is not strong. In recent political history, the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman Ross Perot in 1992, who was an independent, not technically a third-party candidate. At one point, Perot was leading in some polls against then-President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. However, after dropping out of the race before re-entering, he lost support and eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote.\n\nRepublicans were arguably given a boost by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, when Nader picked up 2.7 percent of the vote against Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush. Johnson's potential impact is hard to gauge, but he could receive a boost in the coming weeks as some Republicans reportedly consider backing him. Most notably, 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are rumored to be mulling endorsements for Johnson. Marvin Bush, youngest brother of Jeb and George W., also endorsed Johnson last week.\n\n\"From what I've heard from the Bush and Romney camps, they're still considering it,\" Sarwark claimed. Asked if the party is looking just to make a strong showing or go all the way, Sarwark was bullish: \"There's a path to the presidency. The ground is there.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Inaction on Same-Sex Marriage: Awaiting a \"Trend-Line\" and the Evolution of Society\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court has declined to take up the issue of same-sex marriage, effectively allowing lower-level courts' pro-same-sex marriage rulings to stand in several states. This decision has placed Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin on notice to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to avoid direct involvement in the issue seems to indicate a strategy of waiting for a majority of states to be compelled by lower-level appeals courts to accept same-sex marriage. Once a \"trend-line\" is established, the Court may declare that society has \"evolved,\" and a new standard must be enshrined. This approach mirrors the logic of the landmark case, Lawrence v. Texas (2003), where the Court waited 17 years to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), which had previously criminalized anal sex.\n\nIn Lawrence v. Texas, the Court waited for societal acceptance to shift before declaring that the Constitution protects adult persons' private sexual lives. Critics, such as the late Justice Scalia, argued that the Court's statement was false, as states still regulate various sexual activities, including prostitution, adult incest, adultery, obscenity, and child pornography.\n\nThe Court's strategy allows lower courts to violate traditional marriage laws, which are then declared unconstitutional due to an \"emerging consensus\" on violating the Constitution. Last year, the Court ruled that state attorneys general could refuse to defend state laws in favor of traditional marriage, effectively allowing the executive branch to undermine laws it opposes.\n\nThe Court further set the predicate for future same-sex marriage rulings in United States v. Windsor, where it declared anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency.\n\nCritics argue that this approach allows the Court to avoid doing its judicial duty, relying on lower-level courts to violate the Constitution, and then declaring the Constitution magically changed due to an \"emerging\" consensus on violating the Constitution.\n\nBen Shapiro, Senior Editor-At-Large of \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of the book \"The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration,\" has expressed concerns about this approach, stating that it allows the people no recourse and that the process is largely top-down, dictated by the Court's interpretation of societal evolution.",
    " Title: New Details Emerge on Benghazi Terror Attack: FBI and NCTC Contradict CIA Director's Initial Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days after the deadly terror attack in Libya, representatives from the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) provided separate briefings to Capitol Hill, stating that the evidence supports an Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda-affiliated attack, according to sources familiar with the matter. This assessment contrasts with the briefing by CIA Director David Petraeus on Capitol Hill the following day, which described the attack as tied to a demonstration.\n\nThe Sept. 13 assessment by the FBI and NCTC was based on intercepts that included individuals believed to have participated in the attack, who were celebratory, as well as a claim of responsibility. The briefings also revealed a series of Al Qaeda training camps just outside of Benghazi, where the attack occurred and resulted in the deaths of four Americans. The area was described as a hotbed for the militant group Ansar al-Sharia as well as Al Qaeda in North Africa.\n\nSources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that there was no mention of a demonstration or any significant emphasis on the anti-Islam video that for days was cited by administration officials as a motivating factor. The Petraeus briefing on Sept. 14 conflicted with that of the FBI and NCTC.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Petraeus characterized the attack as more consistent with a flash mob, where the militants showed up spontaneously with RPGs. Petraeus downplayed to lawmakers the skill needed to fire mortars, which were also used in the attack and to some were seen as evidence of significant pre-planning. As \u2588\u2588\u2588 previously reported, four mortars were fired - two missed the annex, but the mortar team re-calibrated and the next two mortars were direct hits.\n\nSources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Petraeus seemed wedded to the narrative that the attack was linked to a demonstration and was spontaneous as opposed to pre-meditated. Petraeus was \"absolute\" in his description with few, if any, caveats. As lawmakers learned more about the attack, including through raw intelligence reports, they were \"angry, disappointed, and frustrated\" that the CIA director had not provided a more complete picture of the available intelligence.\n\nReached for comment, a spokesperson for the NCTC referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the Sept. 28 statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which said the assessment changed to indicate that it did not stem from a protest, but rather was deliberate and organized.\n\nA U.S. intelligence official disputed the characterization of Petraeus' briefing to lawmakers on Sept. 14, saying: \"The first briefing (to the Hill) carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information, with briefers noting that extremists - including those with possible links to AQIM and Ansar al-Sharia - were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous. The talking points (from that weekend) clearly reflect the early indications of extremist involvement in a direct assault.\"\n\nAs for the current assessment of the Benghazi attack, a U.S. intelligence official said no one is ruling out the idea militants may have aspired to attack the U.S., though the bulk of available information supports the early assessment that extremists - with ties to al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia - did not plan the attacks for days or weeks in advance.\n\nOne source who heard Petraeus brief also told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"I can confirm that he explicitly stated both to the House and the Senate oversight committees that members of AQIM and AAS participated in the attack in Benghazi. That assessment still stands.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have given a mixed picture of what happened that day, acknowledging that an investigation is underway. The office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper last month acknowledged the strike was a coordinated terror attack, but officials have subsequently said the strike could have been opportunistic - taking their cue from protests over the film in Egypt.\n\nHowever, some point to the use of mortars and several other strands of evidence to claim the attack involved some premeditation.",
    " Title: Violence Erupts in Cairo as Egyptian Security Forces Disperse Muslim Brotherhood Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Egyptian security forces have moved to disperse two protest camps in Cairo set up by supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. The operation, which took place on Wednesday, resulted in hundreds of casualties and at least 149 deaths, according to the Egyptian government.\n\nThe smaller camp, located at Nahda Square near Cairo University, was cleared within hours. However, the larger camp around the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in the northeastern suburb of Nasr City remained under siege by police forces into the morning.\n\nThe Egyptian interim government expressed sorrow over the bloodshed and blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for any violence. In a statement, the government urged protesters to refrain from using violence and warned against any attempts to attack state buildings and police stations.\n\nThe operation, long-anticipated, saw security forces using armored cars, bulldozers, tear gas, and automatic weapons. Protesters retaliated with Molotov cocktails and broken paving stones, while military snipers targeted them, according to reports.\n\nCasualty figures varied widely. Western reporters at several morgues and hospitals reported seeing dozens of dead protesters with gunshot wounds to the head and chest, suggesting that authorities were shooting to kill. The Muslim Brotherhood claimed hundreds had been killed by indiscriminate fire from soldiers and police, while the authorities reported about a dozen deaths, including two police officers.\n\nThe events of Wednesday are likely to widen the divide between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and secularists and religious minorities who largely supported the military's July 3 ouster of Morsi. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a human rights group, reported that the crackdown had already spurred attacks by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in southern Egypt.\n\nThis development marks a significant escalation in the political crisis that has gripped Egypt since the military's removal of Morsi. The aftermath of the operation is likely to have far-reaching implications for Egypt's political landscape and stability.",
    " Title: Stephen Moore: Trump's Victory Shifts Republican Party, Aims to Revive U.S. Manufacturing Jobs\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Donald Trump and former libertarian, discussed the transformation of the Republican Party under Trump's leadership. Moore, who worked for Ronald Reagan and is an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, the grass-roots organization that helped launch the Tea Party, stated that the Republican Party under Trump is no longer the party of Ronald Reagan.\n\nMoore explained that the voters have different concerns in 2016 compared to when Ronald Reagan was president, and Trump saw something in the voters that no one else did. He emphasized that the Republican Party under Trump is more populist and working-class-oriented, with some aspects that conservatives will like and some that they will find uncomfortable.\n\nRegarding Trump's plans to revive U.S. manufacturing jobs, Moore discussed the president-elect's focus on being tough with China on trade and his personal business holdings. Moore believes that Trump will be a tougher negotiator with China, but he is uncertain about the outcome. He also stated that China's economy is highly dependent on the United States market, and Trump has made this point.\n\nOn the issue of whether China will have leverage over Trump due to his business dealings, Moore expressed doubt. He believes that Trump will put his business dealings aside to act in the national interest and that Americans will demand it.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's promise to bring back jobs to industries such as steel and coal that peaked decades ago, Moore acknowledged that some jobs may never return. However, he believes that a better tax system and a better regulatory system can bring factories, jobs, and companies back to the United States.\n\nRegarding Trump's proposed 35 percent tariffs if he fails to renegotiate trade deals with China and Mexico, Moore expressed opposition to tariffs, stating that they are a terrible idea. He has tried to push Trump in the right direction on this issue and has encouraged Trump to emphasize that trade is good, but it must be fair and free. Moore also stated that he has come around to the idea that trade is good, but it must be fair and free.",
    " Title: Minnesota Sen. Al Franken Resigns Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations, Citing Irony of Trump's Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken announced his resignation from the U.S. Senate on Thursday, following a series of sexual misconduct allegations that have plagued his political career since late 2017.\n\nFranken, who has maintained that some of the accusations against him are untrue and that he remembers other incidents differently, took a parting shot at President Trump, citing the irony of a man who has been accused of sexual assault himself sitting in the Oval Office while a man who has been accused of preying on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.\n\nThe announcement was made in a speech before a gathering of 18 Democratic senators, staff, and family members. Some were visibly emotional during the 11-minute speech, while others remained stoic. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan was the only Republican senator present.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar were also in attendance, having been among the Democrats who called for Franken's resignation. Klobuchar, who spoke with Franken on Wednesday, said in a statement that his decision to resign was the right one.\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine also confirmed that he had a \"detailed conversation\" with Franken on Wednesday, stating that the senator had followed his advice and done the right thing.\n\nGovernor Mark Dayton of Minnesota will now appoint a successor to fill the remaining two years of Franken's term. Sources suggest that the likely candidate could be Democratic Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, a close ally of Franken.\n\nThe calls for Franken's resignation began in earnest after California radio broadcaster Leeann Tweeden posted a blog detailing Franken's inappropriate behavior towards her in 2006, including kissing and groping her without her consent. Since then, seven additional women have come forward with allegations against Franken.\n\nThe latest allegation involves a woman who claims Franken groped her at a Media Matters party during the first Obama inauguration. Previously, another woman accused Franken of forcibly trying to kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006.\n\nThe calls for Franken's resignation come in the wake of similar calls for the resignation of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who stepped down following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. In Alabama, several women have accused Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers.\n\nTrump, who faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment during his presidential campaign, has endorsed Moore. Franken's resignation follows a growing movement to hold those accused of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Assures \"Dreamers\" of Relative Safety, Urges Undocumented Residents to Report Crimes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly clarified the administration's stance on immigration, stating that while anyone in the country illegally is subject to deportation, the focus is on rooting out the \"worst\" of those residing in the U.S. unlawfully. He emphasized that the administration is not targeting individuals protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\nKelly stated that the President has tasked him with two key objectives on immigration: securing the Southwest border and removing the \"worst\" of the undocumented population. He clarified that this means they are not interested in pursuing individuals who are simply in the country illegally.\n\nThe Secretary's comments come as a response to mixed messages regarding who is at risk for deportation, as President Trump has implemented tougher policies on illegal immigration but has also suggested that Dreamers should not worry. The issue was highlighted recently with the deportation of 23-year-old Juan Manuel Montes, who was granted DACA amnesty and was deported to Mexico in February.\n\nKelly also emphasized that illegal immigrants should still report local offenses, stating they can usually do so anonymously. This follows concerns from law enforcement that a drop in reported crimes from certain communities could be a direct result of President Trump's immigration policies.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) suggested that if President Trump truly wants to protect people, he should stop targeting sanctuary cities that refuse to alert federal officials of illegal immigrants in their custody, allowing undocumented residents to come forward freely when crimes occur.\n\nSen. Durbin also warned against insisting on funding for the border wall with Mexico in a stopgap funding bill that must be passed by Friday, stating it could lead to a government shutdown.\n\nDespite Sen. Durbin's warning, Secretary Kelly gave no indication that President Trump plans to back off the demand for funding for the border wall. Kelly stated, \"I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall. So, I would suspect, he'll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding.\"",
    " Title: Alternative Candidates Johnson and Stein Offer an Alternative to Clinton and Trump in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are offering voters an alternative to the two major party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here's everything you need to know:\n\nThe Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, is a former Republican governor of New Mexico who served two terms. Johnson, 63, is a fitness enthusiast who has climbed Mount Everest and is the former CEO of a legal cannabis company. He has long supported marijuana legalization, though he has pledged not to use the drug in the White House if elected. His running mate is another former Republican governor, Bill Weld, of Massachusetts. Both men, while in office, pursued the libertarian principles of small government and less regulation, cutting taxes and vetoing spending programs.\n\nJohnson and Weld are campaigning on a traditional libertarian ticket of small government and individual freedom. As fiscal conservatives, they support a single consumption tax and want to scrap the Dodd-Frank law regulating Wall Street. They generally conform to the libertarian belief that government works best by staying out of people's lives, favoring legalizing marijuana and opposing gun restrictions. They initially opposed mandatory vaccinations (though Johnson has since changed his position), and support the right to abortion and gay marriage.\n\nThe Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, is a Harvard-trained physician turned liberal activist. She is selling herself as the progressive \"Plan B\" for disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters\u2014many of whom have pledged never to vote for \"establishment shill\" Hillary Clinton. Stein, 66, echoes many of Sanders' policies, supporting a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage, a \"wartime-scale mobilization\" to defeat climate change, a single-payer health-care system, and the abolition of all student debt. However, she goes much further to the left, calling for unilateral nuclear disarmament, a 50 percent cut to the military budget, the elimination of all fossil fuels by 2030, and paying reparations for slavery. Stein has expressed concerns about the safety of vaccinations and Wi-Fi, and her running mate, human rights activist Ajamu Baraka, once called President Obama an \"Uncle Tom\" who has betrayed African-Americans.\n\nThe chances of either Johnson or Stein winning the election are close to zero. However, the two main-party nominees, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, are the least liked candidates in the modern political era. Four out of 10 voters think neither would make a good president\u2014leaving the door wide open for Johnson and Stein to attract a significant protest vote. Johnson has climbed to over 10 percent in some polls, and in a four-way matchup against Trump and Clinton, he and Stein together collect up to 14 percent of registered voters. That's enough to affect whether Trump or Clinton wins in some critical swing states.\n\nTrump will lose support to Johnson among Republican \"NeverTrumpers\" who do not view the bombastic businessman as a true conservative, and who are attracted to Johnson's fiscal conservatism and pro\u2013gun rights record. Clinton, though, could get hit on two fronts. Many hard-core \"Bernie-or-Bust Democrats\" are pledging their allegiance to \"Jill, not Hill.\" But Hillary could also lose votes to Johnson, whose support for marijuana legalization and a rollback of government surveillance appeals to young voters. That has led many Democrats to warn that Johnson and Stein could jointly become the Ralph Nader of the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2000, Nader, the Green Party candidate, pulled thousands of votes in Florida away from Democrat Al Gore\u2014a state George W. Bush won by just 537 votes. That gave the election to Bush, even though he lost the overall popular vote to Gore. This year, if the election proves tighter than polls currently indicate, it's possible that Johnson and Stein could cost Clinton enough votes in a key battleground state or two to alter the outcome of the election. Johnson embraces the idea of being the \"spoiler\" candidate. \"I will lose no sleep if that's the label given to me,\" he says. \"This is a party that needs crashing.\" Stein also rejects the idea that voters must choose \"the lesser evil,\" arguing that Clinton is not a true progressive. \"The American people are clamoring for another choice,\" she says.\n\nBoth Johnson and Stein are desperate to make it into the first presidential debate, on Sept. 26. However, they face a steep climb. A candidate needs to hit 15 percent in five national polls to make it onto the stage, according to debate commission rules. Johnson is polling at an average of 8.8 percent, while Stein is at 3.4 percent. The two candidates face a classic catch-22: They won't be included until they prove they are competitive in the polls, but can't compete without the attention and name recognition a prime-time presidential debate would bring. Johnson and Stein are suing the commission for the right to participate. If they were part of the debates, the race might be very different. \"For people to choose Gary Johnson,\" says political operative Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Trump, \"they need to know that he's running.\" In 2012, Stone backed and provided advice to Johnson's first presidential run as a Libertarian, when he won just 1 percent of the vote in the race against President Obama and Mitt Romney. \"There was another choice,\" Stone says, \"it's just that nobody knew about it.\"",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Bill Faces Criticism Over Border Security and Enforcement Discretion\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently unveiled Senate immigration bill, which promises a multibillion-dollar investment in border security, has come under fire from critics who argue that it contains a significant loophole regarding the enforcement of immigration laws. The bill, co-authored by a bipartisan group of senators, has been criticized for giving the government discretion in enforcing immigration laws, a concern that has long been raised by the union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nIn a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the National ICE Council President Chris Crane expressed his disappointment that the bill does not address the concerns of ICE agents, who have long complained about the Obama administration's alleged undermining of their ability to detain and deport select illegal immigrants. Crane's letter was sent on Tuesday, just before the bill's formal release.\n\nCrane's letter highlights the bill's focus on border security measures, such as a security and fencing plan, but criticizes the lack of attention given to interior enforcement. The bill includes \"triggers\" that must be met before illegal immigrants currently in the country can apply for a green card, such as the Department of Homeland Security launching a new border security and fencing plan and achieving high levels of apprehension along high-risk areas on the Mexican border.\n\nHowever, Crane has called for the bill to be held until several major issues are addressed, including what he described as \"directives\" that release \"dangerous criminal aliens\" back into the community and the Obama administration's \"dangerous abuse\" of prosecutorial discretion. The administration has allowed \"prosecutorial discretion\" to focus on deporting high-risk illegal immigrants, but critics warn that legalizing the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country without establishing a strict system of interior enforcement will allow the problem to persist.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a vocal critic of the immigration bill, echoed Crane's concerns, stating that the bill \"neglects almost totally our interior enforcement needs.\" Sessions also criticized the bill for leaving intact the administration's alleged abuse of prosecutorial discretion, which he believes is a major obstacle to immigration reform.\n\nThe bill is set to undergo its first hearing on Friday, and Sen. Rubio, one of the bill's co-authors, has expressed a willingness to consider an immigration overhaul. \"Our immigration system is broken, and the status quo of having 11 million undocumented people living under de facto amnesty will only continue if we do nothing to solve this problem,\" Rubio said.\n\nWhile the path to citizenship and other provisions have drawn scrutiny from congressional Republicans, the nearly 900-page bill contains a number of other measures, including a new system of temporary visas for low-skill workers and expanded visas for high-skill workers. The bill, unlike the recently stalled gun control legislation, comes out of the gate with prominent bipartisan backing.",
    " Title: James O' Keefe's Alleged Deception Unveiled: Washington Post Exposes Project Veritas's Staged Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews over a two-week period, a woman shared a sensational story about an alleged sexual relationship with Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in 1992, which she claimed led to an abortion when she was 15. However, the woman, Jaime T. Phillips, was not a victim but an actor working for investigative journalist James O' Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas.\n\nThe Washington Post uncovered this deception, revealing that O' Keefe had hired a woman to fabricate a story about sexual assault in an attempt to discredit women who had legitimate claims against Moore. This latest incident has once again forced those who support Moore to reconsider their stance.\n\nO' Keefe, however, did not stop there. Caught in the act of creating a video lie, O' Keefe announced his intention to reveal \"the truth,\" including a video of a \"confrontation\" with a Washington Post reporter who supposedly forced his way into the offices at Project Veritas. However, in this instance, it was the Washington Post that was recording the events, including O' Keefe inviting the reporter to come to the office.\n\nA team from the Washington Post, including reporter Ben Terris, visited the Project Veritas offices in Mamaroneck, NY, to investigate Phillips' employment. They observed Phillips entering the office, and O' Keefe, who arrived later, declined to answer questions. O' Keefe invited Terris back for an interview shortly after noon.\n\nAs is typical for O' Keefe, the footage his followers received was a highly edited version of the encounter, designed to make it appear that O' Keefe had not been caught lying, but rather exposing a reporter who had forced his way into the office.\n\nVoters in Alabama can support the truth by donating to Doug Jones' campaign, allowing him to share the facts with every voter in the state.",
    " Title: President Obama Announces Restrictions on Military-Style Equipment for Police Departments, Emphasizes Community Policing\n\n Article:\n\nIn a bid to ease tensions between police and minority communities, President Barack Obama has announced new restrictions on the use of military-style equipment by local law enforcement. The announcement was made during a visit to Camden, New Jersey, one of the state's most crime-ridden cities.\n\nUnder the new recommendations, police forces will be prohibited from acquiring certain types of military-style equipment from federal agencies. The equipment includes tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, and high-caliber weapons and ammunition. The decision was made by a White House task force, whose recommendations were put into place through an executive order on Monday.\n\nThe task force weighed the utility of the equipment to local police against the \"potential negative impact on the community if the equipment was used arbitrarily or inappropriately.\" Local police departments can still purchase this equipment, but they can no longer acquire it from the federal government or use federal funds for the purchase.\n\nPresident Obama's visit to Camden is part of an effort to increase federal funding for community policing initiatives in response to a series of high-profile incidents that have strained relations between officers and residents in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, New York, and Baltimore. Camden, which has seen reforms over the past two years, has experienced falling crime statistics and an increased number of officers in the community.\n\nIn addition to the equipment ban, the White House has outlined several other initiatives that President Obama will highlight on Monday:\n\n1. Police Data Initiative: This initiative will help police departments across the country track use of force and police stops. Data scientists will assist some police departments in refining an early warning system, using data to identify potential problems.\n\n2. Data Release: Twenty-one jurisdictions will release big data sets, providing communities with visibility into key information on police/citizen encounters.\n\n3. Body-Cam Tool Kit: The White House will release a body-camera tool kit to help police plan and implement body-camera programs.\n\n4. Community Policing Grants: The Department of Justice will begin accepting applications for grants designed to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement agencies. The grants will support hiring, training, and technical assistance, as well as the development of innovative community policing strategies, applied research, guidebooks, and best practices that are national in scope.\n\nThese initiatives aim to promote transparency, accountability, and trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.",
    " Title: Former Senator Rick Santorum Announces Second Presidential Bid, Focuses on Immigration and Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally at Penn United Technologies, a manufacturing company near his boyhood home in Pennsylvania, former Senator Rick Santorum officially launched his second bid for the presidency on Wednesday. The 57-year-old Republican vowed to be a champion for working-class Americans, emphasizing his commitment to protecting American workers from the impact of unskilled foreign labor.\n\n\"Working families don't need another president tied to big government or big money. Today is the day we are going to begin to fight back!\" Mr. Santorum declared. \"I am proud to stand here among you, and for you, the American workers who have sacrificed so much, to announce that I am running for president of the United States.\"\n\nMr. Santorum finished as the runner-up to Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican nomination race. This time around, he pledged to offer a \"bold\" conservative vision, which includes abolishing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing the \"corrupt\" tax code with a \"simple, fair, flat tax.\"\n\nHe also promised to cut government spending, revoke every executive order and regulation that costs American jobs, and to fight for a stronger education system, military members, and pro-life legislation. In terms of foreign policy, Mr. Santorum vowed to adopt a muscular approach and protect American workers who have been hurt by the nation's immigration laws.\n\n\"Over the last 20 years, we have brought into this country\u2014legally and illegally\u201435 million mostly unskilled workers, and the result? Over that same period of time, workers' wages and family incomes have flat-lined,\" he said. \"Hillary Clinton and big business, they have called for a massive influx in unskilled labor. Business does it because they want to control costs. Hillary does it, well, she just wants votes.\"\n\n\"Their priorities are profits and power. My priority is you, the American worker,\" he added.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that Mr. Santorum's bid for the presidency will face challenges given the strength of the field and the presence of several fresh faces, including Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nReligious conservatives will also have a variety of other candidates to choose from, including Mr. Cruz, Mr. Carson, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008.\n\nIn 2012, voters turned to Mr. Santorum before the Iowa caucuses as their pick to be the anyone-but-Romney candidate after testing a number of his rivals. Mr. Santorum won the caucuses and a total of 11 nomination contests, benefiting from strong support from born-again or evangelical Christians, and the financial backing of Foster Friess, who helped bankroll the pro-Santorum \"Red, White and Blue Fund\" Super PAC.\n\nMr. Friess is supporting Mr. Santorum once again and attended his campaign launch. An immediate challenge facing Mr. Santorum could be qualifying for the first GOP-sanctioned debate on Aug. 6, which will be hosted by Fox News and is limiting the number of participants to the top 10 of an average of national polls. The latest Real Clear Politics Average of polls shows Mr. Santorum running tenth.\n\n\"It's going to be extremely critical for him that he makes that first debate stage,\" Mr. Budzisz said.\n\nMr. Santorum is scheduled to spend the rest of the week making campaign stops in Iowa and South Carolina as part of a \"Take America Back Tour.\"",
    " Title: CNBC Republican Debate Marks Potential End of Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe third Republican debate, hosted by CNBC, was marked by a series of contentious exchanges and a perceived bias towards the moderators, leading to a night of embarrassment for the network. The debate, which was primarily remembered for CNBC's poor moderation and the potential end of Jeb Bush's presidential campaign, saw several candidates directly criticizing the slanted nature of the coverage in real-time.\n\nJeb Bush, who has underperformed in the polls, seemed to struggle during the debate, with Marco Rubio delivering a strong counter-punch when Bush criticized his missed Senate votes. Rubio's response was met with applause from the audience, and the former Florida Governor's campaign may have suffered a significant blow.\n\nMarco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Carly Fiorina also delivered strong performances, with Rubio and Cruz taking aim at the moderators for their biased questions, and Fiorina showcasing her intelligence and preparedness. Donald Trump and Ben Carson also had their moments, but their denials on challenges brought by moderators that turned out to be untrue may have raised questions about their honesty.\n\nThe debate was a turning point for Jeb Bush's campaign, with many pundits suggesting that his campaign may have suffered a mortal blow. Despite Bush's resources and well-oiled campaign machine, his performance during the debate may have marked the end of his presidential aspirations.\n\nIn a defining moment, Rubio delivered a stirring take-down of Hillary Clinton and her abettors in the mainstream media, while Cruz channeled the frustration of conservatives at home and shamed the moderators to their faces. Fiorina, too, delivered a strong performance, casting herself as Clinton's \"worst nightmare\" and emphasizing the need for smaller government.\n\nThe debate was a night to forget for CNBC, with the network's poor production values, focus, and moderation drawing criticism from both candidates and viewers. It remains to be seen if the RNC will require a conservative media partner for future debates, following CNBC's performance.",
    " Title: Bloomberg's Unprecedented Campaign Strategy: Skipping Early States for Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. - The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had built up what it described as the largest California operation of any Democratic candidate, until billionaire Michael Bloomberg entered the race in November with seemingly unlimited resources.\n\nWithin two months, the former New York City mayor hired 200 employees in California, according to his campaign, dwarfing Sanders' 80-strong team in the state while spending more on television ads nationally than all 10 other Democratic candidates combined.\n\nBloomberg's unprecedented blitzkrieg - spending over a quarter-billion dollars nationwide on advertising alone since November - could upend the competition for California and the other 13 states that vote on March 3, otherwise known as Super Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, as his rivals barnstorm across Iowa ahead of the state's first-in-the-nation caucuses that evening, Bloomberg will be nearly 1,900 miles (3,060 km) away campaigning in California, the single biggest prize of the presidential primary with 10 times as many delegates available as in Iowa.\n\nThe contrast highlights both risks and opportunities of his unorthodox strategy: Bloomberg is skipping Iowa and three other states that vote in February and traditionally help anoint front-runners, instead employing his massive fortune to overwhelm opponents in much larger, delegate-rich states that will start voting from March.\n\nIt's a path that has been tried unsuccessfully by others in the past, notably another former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani. But none had anywhere close to Bloomberg's financial might.\n\nThere is evidence his spending onslaught is working. In the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll, Bloomberg had risen to third nationally among Democratic and independent voters, trailing former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders but moving ahead of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"He is opening up field offices in California like I have never seen in a primary,\" said Brian Brokaw, a Democratic strategist in Sacramento. \"All the ingredients are in place, but whether that can actually be baked into something real is unknown.\"\n\nIn a single day, Super Tuesday puts up for grabs nearly a third of the 3,979 state delegates that will help select a Democratic nominee. By contrast, the four early states - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina - award less than 4% of the delegates combined.\n\nWhile most of the 11 Democratic presidential contenders have swarmed Iowa and New Hampshire since November, Bloomberg has had the rest of America largely to himself, pouring resources into states that don't usually get such attention at this stage in the race.\n\nThis year's Super Tuesday could prove particularly crucial, especially if the first four states fail to produce a decisive front-runner.\n\nWhile national polls show moderate Biden and liberal firebrand Sanders jockeying for the lead, early state polls suggest a close four-way race that includes Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIf Biden prevails in Iowa and New Hampshire, he could consolidate support of the moderates and push Bloomberg aside before he even reaches a ballot, several Democratic strategists said.\n\nOn the other hand, a Sanders surge could open a door for Bloomberg, given uncertainty among moderate voters about the self-described Democratic socialist's ability to beat Republican President Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"His fate is not in his own power,\" said Bob Shrum, director of the USC Center for the Political Future in Los Angeles, referring to Bloomberg. \"He is running on a bet that Biden won't make it through and he becomes the big alternative to Sanders.\"\n\nIn all, Bloomberg's campaign has 800 staffers in place across 35 states, along with hundreds more at his campaign headquarters in New York. In Texas, the second-largest state to vote on Super Tuesday after California, Bloomberg has a staff of 150. Warren, who appears to have the next biggest presence, has more than two dozen paid staffers in the state.\n\nBloomberg's spending spree has also inflated the cost of television ads in Texas, potentially making it even harder for other candidates to keep up, an aide for a rival campaign said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe other candidates' Super Tuesday operations will soon get an influx of staffers, as organizers depart states like Iowa to bolster efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn a recent memo to supporters, Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, said the campaign has more than 1,000 staff members and more than 100 field offices in 31 states. That includes hundreds of organizers in states that vote after Super Tuesday, such as Pennsylvania and Washington.\n\n\"We expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,\" he wrote.\n\nSanders is also relying on enthusiastic volunteers. In Texas, volunteers have held more than 560 events for Sanders, while the candidate himself has visited four times this primary season.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 last month, Bloomberg said he was forced to skip the first four voting states because \"all the political operatives were taken up\" by the time he decided to enter the race. But he vowed to go everywhere else.\n\n\"You want to go where the voters are. And that means the big states... And I'd like to go to every one of the states,\" he told \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: Bloomberg News Addresses Conflict of Interest as Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg Enters 2020 Presidential Race\n\nIn a memo to staff obtained by CNN, Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait acknowledged the potential conflict of interest as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg enters the 2020 presidential race.\n\nMicklethwait wrote, \"There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves.\" He further stated, \"No previous presidential candidate has owned a journalistic organization of this size.\"\n\nTo address this issue, Micklethwait announced that David Shipley, Tim O'Brien, and some members of the Board responsible for Bloomberg Opinion's editorials will take a leave of absence to join Bloomberg's campaign. The Board responsible for these editorials will be suspended, and there will be no unsigned editorials during this period.\n\nHowever, columnists who produce the majority of Bloomberg Opinion's content will continue to speak for themselves, and the outlet will continue to take some op-ed articles from outsiders, albeit not op-eds on the election.\n\nBloomberg News will continue its normal campaign coverage, but will not investigate Bloomberg, his family, or his foundation, and will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries. Micklethwait also stated that if other news outlets run investigative pieces on Bloomberg or others, they won't \"hide\" them from readers.\n\nMicklethwait added that they have reporters continuing to investigate the Trump administration, as the government of the day. If Bloomberg is chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate and Donald Trump emerges as the Republican one, they will reassess how they do that.",
    " Title: White House Strategically Silences Gun Control Groups in Push for New Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to maintain a unified front as President Barack Obama pushes for new gun control laws, the White House has reportedly muted key gun control groups by offering them access and involvement in exchange for silence and support.\n\nAccording to conversations with several involved parties, the White House has set forth implied rules: no infighting, no second-guessing in the press, and support for whatever the president and Vice President Joe Biden propose. The most crucial rule, however, is to avoid making waves or getting ahead of the White House.\n\nIn return, these groups are granted a voice in the discussions, a role in any final agreement, and weekly meetings with Bruce Reed, Biden's chief of staff, under the condition that they do not disclose what transpires during these meetings.\n\nOne regular attendee of these meetings, who spoke anonymously, described the meetings as a forum where everyone is \"glad to be in the room\" due to the long-standing stagnation of the gun control issue and the newfound opportunity for progress.\n\nFor the White House, which declined to comment on Reed's meetings or the relationships with the gun control groups, this strategy is aimed at ensuring the president has a united front as he advocates for new laws, and to avoid taking the blame if and when the negotiations fail.\n\nThis strategy has forced a significant change on some of Washington's most vocal gun control advocates, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Third Way, Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly.\n\nIn past fights, gun control groups have sparred with each other and dictated the agenda to allies in Congress. Now, they are content with merely being included in the discussion and still holding out hope that something might happen.\n\nPaul Helmke, who served as the Brady Campaign president from 2006 to 2011, stated, \"We need the White House.\" This sentiment remains true even as the prospects for any legislation have diminished on even the most basic measures.",
    " Title: Clinton's Fiery Response to Benghazi Inquiry Stirs Debate, Ahead of Kerry's Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Wednesday's Capitol Hill hearing, the focus has shifted towards Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's robust response to Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's accusation that the Obama administration initially misrepresented the culprits behind the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Johnson described Clinton's performance as \"theatrics,\" while Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, known for his liberal leanings, countered with the assertion that \"The outgoing secretary of state served up a potent brew of righteous outrage.\" On CBS This Morning, Post columnist David Ignatius suggested that Johnson might have been one of the first in a series of Republicans to target Clinton, given her potential as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nDuring the hearing, when Johnson pressed Clinton on the administration's knowledge of the attack and its timeline, Clinton displayed visible anger as she stated:\n\n\"The fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again.\"\n\nC-SPAN's video library has made available two clips of Clinton's exchange with Johnson. The first, lasting 2 minutes and 25 seconds, provides a broad sense of the conversation that led to her animated comments. A shorter version, focusing on the sharpest part of the exchange, is also available.\n\nClinton is soon to step down. President Obama has nominated Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) to succeed her. Today, at 10 a.m. ET, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations\u2014the same committee that held Wednesday's hearing\u2014will hold its confirmation hearing for Kerry.\n\nKerry, the committee's chairman, will not preside over his own nomination hearing. Instead, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) will be in the chairman's seat. It is expected that Kerry will face little opposition in the Senate. He is to be \"introduced\" at today's hearing by Secretary Clinton.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Urges Media to Review Controversial Video, Playboy Correspondent Rebuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense exchange during Tuesday's White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed the media to watch a video from conservative journalist James O'Keefe, sparking a heated response from a Playboy correspondent.\n\nThe incident began when Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked a question by Charlie Spiering of Breitbart, a right-wing news outlet, regarding the recent CNN controversy. CNN had published and retracted a story alleging a meeting between a top Trump campaign staffer and a Russian investment fund official, which led to the resignation of three CNN employees, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eric Lichtblau, on Monday.\n\nSpiering asked, \"The president went on Twitter this morning and repeated that CNN was fake news. Why wasn't [CNN's] response good enough for the president?\"\n\nSanders used the question as an opportunity to express her discontent with the mainstream media. She also recommended watching a video from O'Keefe, which features a CNN producer criticizing the network's coverage of the Trump-Russia story. The producer, John Bonifield, works on CNN's health team and does not appear to be connected to the network's political coverage. It also seems that Bonifield was recorded without his knowledge, a significant breach of ethics.\n\n\"There's a video circulating now \u2014 whether it's accurate or not, I don't know \u2014 but I would encourage everybody in this room, and frankly everybody across this country, to take a look at it,\" Sanders said. \"I think if it is accurate, it is a disgrace to all of media, all of journalism.\"\n\nSanders' comments were met with a sharp rebuke from a Playboy correspondent, who expressed concern about the inflammatory nature of her words. \"Come on, you're inflaming everybody right here, right now, with those words,\" the correspondent said. \"This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heaven \u2014 any one of us are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us. You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There is no option other than that. We're here to ask you questions. You're here to provide the answers. And what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, 'See, once again, the president is right, and everybody else out here is fake media.'\"\n\nSanders responded calmly, stating, \"I think if anything has been inflamed, it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media.\"\n\nThe exchange underscores the ongoing tension between the White House and the media, with both parties accusing each other of dishonesty and bias. The video in question has sparked debate, with some arguing that it provides evidence of media bias, while others question its accuracy and the ethics of its production.",
    " Title: A Historical Analysis of Sore Losers in the Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an intriguing observation, it has been noted by historians that a common characteristic of modern-day Democratic presidential candidates, with the exception of former President Bill Clinton, is their tendency to exhibit poor sportsmanship, often referred to as being \"sore losers.\" This trait, however, is not reciprocated by their Republican counterparts.\n\nThe article highlights the cases of several Democratic candidates who have expressed dissatisfaction or contention following election losses. For instance, former President Barack Obama, who won the presidency twice, has been criticized for his behavior post-White House, particularly in his dealings with writers working on his books, speeches, and letters to the editor. The article suggests that Obama's writing skills may be less than stellar, and his mood may be influenced by economic data that shows President Donald Trump's economy outperforming Obama's.\n\nThe article then delves into the 1976 election, where Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. Carter, according to the article, was in a state of shock for years following the election and became the first American president to speak ill of a sitting president while abroad. Al Gore, the inventor of the Internet, is another example, having lost to a lesser-known Texas politician in a race decided by a narrow margin in the Electoral College. Gore reportedly held onto his grievances for years.\n\nIn 2004, Senator John Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, ran for president and faced the same Texas opponent who defeated Gore. Kerry's military service and subsequent anti-war activism were subjects of controversy, leading to the formation of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which contributed to his election loss. The article suggests that Kerry, like his predecessors, has continued to express dissatisfaction with the outcome of the election.\n\nThe article concludes by mentioning Hillary Clinton's ongoing discontent following her 2016 election loss. Despite the passage of more than two years since her defeat, Clinton and her supporters are still vocal in their criticism of President Trump, the Russians, and anyone aligned with the President. The article suggests a parallel between Clinton's current stance and her actions in 1968.\n\nThe article offers a historical perspective on the tendency of Democratic presidential candidates to exhibit poor sportsmanship following election losses. While the article does not pass judgment on the validity of their grievances, it does highlight a pattern of behavior that sets Democrats apart from their Republican counterparts in this regard.",
    " Title: US Consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, Closed Due to Specific Threat; US-Pakistan Relations Under Scrutiny\n\nA daily summary of global reports on security issues:\n\nThe United States has closed its consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, and moved all non-essential personnel to the embassy in Islamabad due to a specific threat to the consulate amid a spate of extremist attacks across the country. The move was announced today, with the consulate not expected to reopen for an undetermined period.\n\nThe decision to close the consulate was made following a threat to the facility, according to US Embassy spokeswoman Meghan Gregonis. As a precautionary measure, only essential personnel will remain in Lahore. The consulate was already closed yesterday through Sunday for Eid al-Fitr, a festive holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe closure of the US consulate in Lahore is unrelated to the closure of 19 US diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East and Africa in the last week. The US has also issued a travel alert for Pakistan, warning of threats to American citizens in the country.\n\nUS diplomatic posts in Pakistan have been targeted before, most notably the consulate in Peshawar in 2010, where a car bomb and grenade attack killed four Pakistanis. The Pakistani government is currently on high alert, with intelligence indicating plans for militant attacks on key locations such as the airport and parliament building.\n\nIn a significant development, a major suicide bombing in an Islamabad mosque was thwarted today when the bomber was gunned down before entering the mosque and detonating his vest of explosives. The violence has been widespread, with local groups linked to Al Qaeda and opposing the Pakistani government's alliance with the US. However, the majority of their victims are fellow Pakistanis, not Americans.\n\nThe latest wave of violence has caused concern and confusion within the Pakistani government, with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordering his interior minister to visit Quetta and present the national counterterrorism strategy soon. The lack of such a strategy has been a point of criticism, with opposition politicians urging the government to immediately convene a national conference of all political parties to come to a policy consensus.\n\nThe violence has taken a heavy toll on the Pakistani people, with attacks during the holy month of Ramadan resulting in numerous casualties. The latest attack occurred on Friday, when gunmen opened fire on worshipers leaving a mosque in the western city of Quetta, killing 10 people. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, stating it was revenge for a police raid on an allied group.\n\nThe ongoing violence and the lack of a clear counterterrorism strategy have left many Pakistanis despairing, as articulated in an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper the Nation titled \"A difficult Eid.\" The editorial laments the violence that has marred the holy month and the challenges faced by the Pakistani people.\n\nAs the situation in Pakistan continues to unfold, the US and international community will closely monitor developments and assess the impact of the ongoing violence on regional stability and US-Pakistan relations.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Call for Special Counsel to Review FBI and DOJ's Handling of 2016 Election Probes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter to Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Chairmen of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Trey Gowdy, and the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, have requested a special counsel to evaluate the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) handling of the investigations into Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 election.\n\nThe letter, released on Friday, questions the FBI's decision not to prosecute Clinton for her improper use of a private email server while Secretary of State. After a year-long joint congressional inquiry, the committees reviewed thousands of documents and interviewed key witnesses, concluding that former FBI Director James Comey acted improperly when he cleared Clinton of wrongdoing. Some witnesses, including FBI General Counsel James Baker, did not support the exoneration, according to the letter.\n\nThe chairmen had initially asked former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special counsel in March, but he declined and instead appointed U.S. Attorney John Huber to the task. The lawmakers state that Huber is still conducting the review.\n\nIf Whitaker chooses not to appoint a special counsel, the lawmakers suggest that Congress should continue the investigation. The letter also raises concerns about the FBI's handling of the probe into Trump's campaign and possible collusion with Russians, specifically citing the alleged bias of federal agents and their different treatment of the candidates during the election.\n\nThe Republicans, who are set to lose their majority in the House next year, had wanted one last opportunity to question Comey, whom they view as the center of botched decisions at the FBI not to investigate Clinton and instead to focus on Trump. The former FBI Director testified for two days on Capitol Hill earlier this month, and also questioned former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nLynch did not comment on her closed-door questioning, but Comey used the opportunity to criticize the president and question the integrity of the FBI. Comey stated, \"Republicans used to understand the actions of a president matter, the words of a president matter, the rule of law matters, and the truth matters. Where are those Republicans today?\"\n\nThe lawmakers also expressed a desire to speak with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been overseeing the probe into Russian interference and reportedly joked about wearing a wire to secretly record the president.",
    " Title: Buzzfeed Secures $50 Million Investment from Andreeson Horowitz for Expansion and Content Diversification\n\nArticle:\n\nInternet media company Buzzfeed has secured a $50 million investment from venture capital firm Andreeson Horowitz. The investment values Buzzfeed at $850 million, with plans to utilize the funds for content expansion, video production, and global office openings.\n\nChris Dixon, partner at Andreeson Horowitz, described Buzzfeed as a \"preeminent media company\" in a statement. The website, which initially started in 2006 as an aggregator of light-hearted lists, videos, and quizzes, has since evolved to cater to a younger demographic and office workers seeking entertainment.\n\nBuzzfeed's slick layout and colloquial tone made it a hit among users, who engaged with its content to discover their \"celebrity cat BFF\" or participate in other viral quizzes. In recent years, the company has shifted its focus towards current affairs, hiring a team of journalists and blending its irreverent style with hard news.\n\nAccording to the company, 75% of its hits come via social media referrals, primarily from Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. Buzzfeed attracts approximately four times more viewers per month than The New York Times and was valued more than three times higher than The Washington Post, which was purchased by Jeff Bezos for $250 million this year.\n\nIn a blog post, Chris Dixon explained that Andreeson Horowitz invested in Buzzfeed due to its \"disruptive\" nature, having changed the online media landscape. The company's success is attributed to its understanding of the internet and formatting its content for mobile devices, catering to users who browse while waiting in lines or commuting to work.\n\nOne of the primary uses for the new investment will be to allocate more resources towards Buzzfeed Motion Pictures, its video unit based in Los Angeles. The company plans to focus on producing videos ranging from six seconds to one-hour documentaries. Buzzfeed's videos are already popular, with many being picked up by mainstream media sites, such as the viral video \"What Men Are Really Saying When Catcalling Women.\"\n\nAs Buzzfeed continues to grow and evolve, it remains to be seen whether the company will venture into film production, potentially bringing stories like \"23 Ways To Have The Coolest Locker In School\" to the big screen.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Rising Political Polarization on Climate Change in the U.S., with WSJ Climate Coverage Accused of Denial and Misinformation\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by a team of sociologists at Oklahoma State University has found that political polarization on climate change is growing in the United States. Today's Republicans are less likely than they were a decade ago to accept that the effects of global warming have begun, that humans are responsible, and that there is a scientific consensus on these questions. Democrats and independents are slightly more likely to answer these questions correctly today than a decade ago.\n\nThe study, titled \"Inequality, Polarization, and the Dynamics of U.S. Public Opinion on Global Warming,\" was published in the journal Climatic Change. The research found that climate change is now more polarizing in the U.S. than abortion or gay marriage.\n\nThe study's authors note that what was once a modest tendency for Congressional Republicans to be less pro-environmental than their Democratic counterparts has become a chasm, with Republicans taking near-unanimous anti-environmental stances on relevant legislation in recent years, especially in 2015.\n\nPolicymakers work for their constituents, so if Republican voters are generally apathetic about the tremendous threats posed by climate change, party leaders have relatively little motivation to tackle the problem (aside from the obvious, like protecting future generations and the long-term viability of their political party).\n\nHowever, the public responds to cues from intellectual and cultural leaders. Were Republican leaders to start listening to climate science experts, many of their voters would likely follow suit. After all, most American conservatives already support climate policies; they just don't view the issue as a priority. Unfortunately, today's Republican Party is essentially controlled by the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe study notes that the conservative movement, fearful of the regulatory implications of climate change, and seeking to defend the current economic system built on fossil fuel use, has been the driving force behind organized climate change denial.\n\nPublic perception and priorities are also heavily influenced by the media. A 2013 study found that conservative media consumers are more likely to distrust scientific experts and reject climate science realities.\n\nRelatedly, a new report by Media Matters on climate coverage in major American newspaper opinion pages found pervasive misinformation in the Wall Street Journal. Out of 93 climate-related opinion pieces published in the Journal during the time period examined, 31 featured climate science denial or other scientifically inaccurate claims about climate change (33 percent).\n\nA study last year found that the WSJ's biased climate coverage extended beyond its opinion pages to its news coverage as well. And during the time of the scandalous #ExxonKnew revelations, Media Matters found that the WSJ was a constant apologist for the oil company.\n\nThe WSJ readership is heavily comprised of wealthy, powerful men, and it has become an increasingly conservative paper since Rupert Murdoch purchased it. Conservative media consumers are bombarded with climate misinformation and fossil fuel industry propaganda, usually without the authors' fossil fuel ties being disclosed.\n\nThe industry has created an echo chamber in which they control the climate messaging of conservative media and party leaders, which in turn trickles down to misinform Republican voters, growing the partisan gap on climate change. The authors of the Oklahoma State study see no easy way to break through what they call the \"denial countermovement\":\n\nconsisting of fossil fuel corporations and business allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, conservative think tanks and their funders, conservative media, and a large supporting cast of front groups, bloggers, and contrarian scientists.\n\nDoes any persuasive framing strategy hold special promise for penetrating Republicans' partisan/ideological identities? The evidence so far gives little basis for optimism.\n\nThere's plenty of blame to go around. Republican policymakers have failed to deliver much-needed leadership on climate change, American conservatives have relied too heavily on biased media sources, and conservative media outlets like Murdoch's WSJ have misinformed their readers.\n\nUntil the fossil fuel industry's control over conservative policymakers and media loosens, American climate action will be up to the Democratic Party. This weekend, President Obama and Chinese President Xi announced they will formally ratify the Paris climate change agreement. If she is elected president, Hillary Clinton likewise plans to rely on executive actions to tackle climate change.\n\nBut there's a limit to what the President of the United States can do on his or her own. US Congress still controls American climate policy, or the lack thereof. As long as the conservative media continues to misinform readers and breed a conservative culture of climate denial, American efforts to tackle the threat of climate change will be constrained, and the future of human society and of the Republican Party will be endangered.",
    " Title: A Call for a National Discourse Do-Over: Banning the \"Butt Defense\" in Political Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the New Year begins, the nation finds itself in a familiar position, yearning for a fresh start while grappling with the state of its national discourse. Instead of engaging in adult conversations that could potentially bring about change, Americans have opted for a more combative approach, launching verbal attacks from the safety of their digital screens.\n\nYesterday, I shared a social media post that aimed to encapsulate the need for a change in our discourse. The post featured a snarling image of an angry dog and the ageless wisdom of Proverbs 26:17, \"Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is he who rushes into a quarrel not his own.\" The hope was that this idea would go viral, but unfortunately, we seem too eager to stake a position in the day's trending battle, whatever it may be.\n\nIn an effort to promote a more civil and productive national discourse, I propose a do-over of the type of discourse that I designed years ago for my own offspring. Baby steps, America.\n\nWhen my kids were young, we had a standard rule for sibling conflicts. It was all about taking responsibility for one's actions and reactions. The \"Butt Defense,\" as I've named it in this article, is the fallback to every political discussion I watch or listen to, and it keeps us mired in the mess we're all convinced the other folks started.\n\nThe \"Butt Defense\" is the defense mechanism that justifies one's own actions by pointing to the actions of the other party. For example, \"Yes, I did hit/slap/pinch him, but he hit/slapped/pinched me first.\" In my role as a judge, I would overrule the \"Butt Defense\" swiftly, reminding the child I was addressing that I wasn't interested in what his or her sibling had said or done. I wanted the child to understand what the correct response should have been to the situation and what they could do differently in the future. Banning the \"Butt Defense\" helped us all move forward.\n\nIf only we could ban the \"Butt Defense\" in our national conversation. Sadly, it's the fallback to every political discussion I watch or listen to, and it keeps us mired in the mess we're all convinced the other folks started.\n\nFor those concerned about the dangerous lack of civility in our politics and sincerely asking what we can do about it in the coming year, the answer lies within our reach. We can start by refusing to defend what should be indefensible. We can call a hateful or atrocious action what it is without giving that person or voice any \"cover\" in our own circle by employing the \"Butt Defense.\"\n\nDoing so would be a start towards ostracizing the extreme elements on all sides and diminishing their impact. Anything less will keep coming back to bite us all in the backsides. Happy New Year!",
    " Title: Google Removes 200 Publishers from Ad Network in Response to Fake News Proliferation\n\nIn the final quarter of 2016, Google took action against 200 publishers, removing them from its AdSense network. The decision was made in response to the increasing prevalence of fake news or propaganda sites. The ban was an extension of an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content.\n\nGoogle has historically weeded out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but the impersonation of news sites became a significant concern following the rise of fake news. In the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. election, Google faced criticism for placing a false story from a fake news site that claimed Donald Trump had won the popular vote, a claim that was later proven false as Trump had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe publishers were banned in November and December, with sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains being a particular focus. These so-called fake news publishers often take advantage of \".co\" domains, which can resemble legitimate news sites that would normally end in \".com.\" Google did not release a list of the banned sites.\n\nIn addition to the ban on fake news sites, Google's 2016 \"bad ads\" report also included data on ads removed for violations of advertising policy. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015. Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads.\n\nGoogle also implemented a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, which are considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016. The company also suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016. These advertisers run what appear to be links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up.\n\nIt is important to note that not all 200 publishers were swept up in the effort to root out fake news sites. NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC, is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",
    " Title: National Parks and Museums Close Amidst Ongoing Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown, now in its third week, has led to the closure of several national parks and museums across the United States. The shutdown, which began on December 21, is a result of a standoff between President Donald Trump and Congress over funding for a border wall.\n\nWhile some federal agencies have been affected by the shutdown, others deemed \"essential\" are still functioning. However, national parks and federal museums, classified as \"non-essential,\" have been closed or are in the process of closing.\n\nThe National Park Service, which oversees many of the affected parks, had implemented a contingency plan earlier this year that allowed many parks to remain open despite the lack of park rangers, maintenance workers, and other staff furloughed by the shutdown. However, without these workers, trash has accumulated, and restrooms have become increasingly dirty. As a result, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Joshua Tree National Parks in California, as well as parts of Yosemite, have been closed.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art remained open using leftover funds that had been previously allocated. However, these funds have since run out, and the Smithsonian announced today that its museums and the National Zoo would be closing. The National Gallery notes at the top of its website that its status after today \"is yet to be determined.\"\n\nWhile the closures may seem like a significant issue, it is important to note that the federal services and employees authorized to use force are still functioning. The closures primarily affect leisure activities and do not pose a significant threat to public safety.\n\nFor tourists planning trips around these parks and museums, there are alternatives. In D.C., for example, there are privately run institutions such as the Phillips Collection, the National Building Museum, and the Newseum that are not affected by the government shutdown. California, which has more national parks than any other state, also has a sprawling state park system.\n\nThe supposed \"trashing\" of the parks is not cause for significant concern. The worry primarily stems from issues involving litter, dirty bathrooms, and people relieving themselves in the wrong places. These problems are not insurmountable and can be remedied once furloughed employees return to work. In the meantime, shutting the parks and not letting the trash pile up any further is the right thing to do.",
    " Title: Colorado Democratic Lawmakers Face Recall Efforts Over Tightened Gun Control Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Colorado's recent passage of some of the nation's strictest gun-control laws, Democratic lawmakers are now facing political backlash in the form of recall efforts. Two groups, Pueblo Freedom and Rights Group, have initiated petition drives targeting state Rep. Mike McLachlan and state Sens. Angela Giron, Evie Hudak, and John Morse.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled legislature passed bills that ban magazines holding more than 15 rounds and require background checks for all gun transfers. These bills were signed into law in March by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. Sen. John Morse, the Senate president, also pushed a more far-reaching proposal that called for holding owners, sellers, and makers of assault-type weapons liable for havoc inflicted by their guns. He withdrew the bill upon realizing he didn't have enough votes, but his efforts have still drawn the ire of the groups.\n\nThe petition drives require signatures from 25 percent of the vote in each lawmaker's district to trigger a special election. The signature deadline is May 21. Colorado's Secretary of State office has confirmed with FoxNew.com that it has approved the forms for the petition drives.\n\nIn addition, the legislature also passed a bill before adjourning Friday that prohibits domestic-violence offenders from owning guns. Hickenlooper is also expected to sign that legislation.\n\nSen. John Morse is receiving support from a group called \"A Whole Lot of People for John Morse,\" which is collecting money and petition signatures to fight the recall effort. The group has so far raised $23,050, according to The Daily Caller.\n\nConnecticut, Maryland, and New York have also passed tighter gun-control measures following the Dec. 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut school in which 20 first-graders and six adults were killed. However, there are no indications of organized recall efforts in those Democratic-leaning states.\n\nState Sen. Evie Hudak has also faced criticism, beyond her support for tighter firearms control, due to a comment made to a rape victim testifying against a bill that would have banned concealed weapons on college campuses. Hudak suggested the attacker might have used the gun on the woman had she been carrying a concealed weapon, saying \"statistics are not on your side even if you had a gun.\"\n\nThe recall efforts underscore the deep divide in opinions regarding gun control in Colorado and the potential political consequences for lawmakers who support stricter regulations.",
    " Title: North Korea's Recent Actions: A Domestic Political Strategy or Bluff?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has been engaged in a series of actions that some have labeled as \"provocations.\" However, a closer examination of these actions suggests that Pyongyang may be more focused on rhetoric than actual military actions.\n\nStephan Haggard, a renowned political scientist, posits that the escalating signals of resolve from North Korea could indicate nervousness as much as strength. Haggard suggests that Kim Jong Un may not have fully consolidated his authority, and some of the rhetoric could be driven by domestic politics.\n\nThe first round of saber-rattling came as the U.N. Security Council deliberated on a new sanctions resolution after North Korea's satellite launch in December and its third nuclear test in February. Despite North Korea's \"withdrawal\" from the armistice, it is unclear what this means, as the armistice is not a peace treaty but merely a ceasefire.\n\nNorth Korea's bluster had little effect on the U.N. debate. The resolution was passed unanimously, with China signing on, despite being portrayed as the result of a U.S.-South Korean cabal. The measure opens the door for tighter financial sanctions, and there is some preliminary evidence that Beijing may be cooperating in tightening economic exchanges with the country.\n\nThe next round of statements came as North Korea and the United States and South Korea entered an annual military training cycle. These periods are always fraught with tension, as Pyongyang denounces the routine exercises as provocative.\n\nWhile North Korea did possibly make one major misstep in arguing that it might undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike, the U.S. and South Korea's overt displays of force may have been an overreaction. The U.S. announced a major new ballistic missile defense initiative, training runs by B52 and B2 bombers, and an updated U.S.-ROK Combined Counter-Provocation Plan. In the last few days, the U.S. was again quite public about its deployment of jet fighters to the peninsula.\n\nHaggard suggests that the larger game at work is probably the difficult-to-read domestic politics of North Korea. It is by no means assured that Kim Jong Un has fully consolidated his authority. By ramping up rhetoric but exercising restraint with respect to actual military actions, the regime can count on the fact that the United States and South Korea are not going to take the first step either.\n\nThe result is that North Korea's exercises and threats of retaliation have been successful in deterring attack, even though none was coming. The regime can claim some sort of victory in staring down American threats in its two big political meetings this week, the timing of which suggests that some of the rhetoric has been driven by domestic politics.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear and missile programs constitute problems that the five parties in the region\u2014China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States\u2014need to address through concerted action. However, overheated rhetoric, however disconcerting, is not the same as an intention to attack. Coolly maintaining our deterrent and not over-reacting to hyperbole is the proper course of action. With luck, the leadership will pivot away from nuclear posturing toward economic reform, the main thing that the people of North Korea really need.",
    " Title: Terror Strikes Bardo Museum in Tunisia: Two Gunmen Killed, Possible Terror Group Link Unknown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Tunisia's capital, a tragic event unfolded on Wednesday as two gunmen stormed the Bardo Museum, a cultural landmark and birthplace of the Arab Spring democracy movement. The attack left 21 people dead, primarily foreign tourists, and several others injured.\n\nThe Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, with the gunmen identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, both Tunisian nationals. Prime Minister Habib Essid confirmed that Laabidi had been flagged by intelligence authorities, although not for any specific reasons.\n\nThe attackers opened fire in the museum, killing 17 tourists from cruise ships, with 12 of the deceased being passengers on the MSC Splendida and five from the Costa Fascinosa. The two gunmen were killed by police, and five other individuals were arrested, with four of them being directly tied to the two gunmen and the other being accused of having ties to the terrorist cell involved.\n\nCulture Minister Latifa Lakhdar spoke defiantly at the museum, stating, \"They are targeting knowledge. They are targeting science. They are targeting reason. They are targeting history. They are targeting memory, because all these things mean nothing in their eyes.\"\n\nThe IS released an online recording claiming responsibility for the shooting rampage, praising the \"knights of the Islamic State\" for the attack and referring to the museum as a \"den of infidels and vice.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, more than 3,000 Tunisians are estimated to have joined IS militants in Iraq and Syria, with training camps in neighboring Libya providing easy access for discontented Tunisian Muslims seeking to fight for the fledgling democracy in Tunis.\n\nJapanese tourist Noriko Yuki, 35, was among the victims, having sustained wounds to her back and hands. Her 68-year-old mother also suffered injuries and underwent surgery at a Tunisian hospital.\n\nU.S. First Lady Michelle Obama expressed condolences over the incident, stating, \"We want to express our condolences over the horrific event yesterday in Tunisia.\"\n\nTunisia, the northernmost African nation, has faced militant activity since the revolution that ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. Since then, there have been numerous assassinations of liberal, secular politicians and attacks on tourist attractions.",
    " Title: President Obama Apologizes for Health Insurance Cancellations as Millions Receive \"Cancellation\" Notices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC News at the White House, President Obama expressed his apologies to Americans who have lost their health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act, despite his repeated promises that they could keep their insurance plans.\n\n\"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,\" he told NBC News. \"We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.\"\n\nThe apology comes after the president added a grandfathering caveat to his healthcare pitch during a speech to Obama for America supporters in Washington D.C. last week. \"If you had or have one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law, and you really like that plan, what we said was, you could keep it... if it hasn't changed since the law's passed,\" he said.\n\nThe administration has been denying for nearly two weeks that President Obama lied or misled millions of people about keeping their health insurance plans. NBC News and other major news outlets reported last week that the White House knew for years that cancellation letters would be issued and told Americans they could keep their plans anyway.\n\nAccording to NBC News, millions of Americans are getting their health insurance canceled under the Affordable Care Act, and the Obama administration has known for about three years that this would happen. About 50% to 75% of the 14 million consumers who buy health insurance individually will receive a \"cancellation\" letter or its equivalent in the next year because their current policies do not meet the standards laid out by the new law, the news organization reports, citing four sources deeply involved in ACA.\n\nDemocratic Senators on Capitol Hill are scrambling to pass legislation that will allow millions of Americans who have received cancellation notices to get their healthcare plans back. It is unclear if President Obama is willing to support that effort.\n\nSixty-seven percent of Americans in the individual health insurance market are expected to lose their current health plans as insurance companies comply with Obamacare requirements under the law.",
    " Title: Billionaire Warren Buffett's Philanthropy Focuses on Abortion Funding, Remains Unreported\n\nArticle:\n\nMay 13, 2014, marks one year since Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of three babies who were delivered alive and then killed at his clinic. The case has brought attention to the abortion issue, with Gosnell becoming a symbol in the pro-life community. However, another figure, more recognizable, has been pushing for abortion in the U.S.: liberal billionaire Warren Buffett.\n\nAccording to a report by the Associated Press, Buffett has donated over $1.2 billion to abortion organizations from 2001 to 2012. This amount is equivalent to the cost of approximately 2.7 million first-trimester abortions, more than twice the number of abortions that occur in an entire year in the United States. Unlike Gosnell, Buffett's actions have been entirely legal.\n\nHowever, the extent of Buffett's support for the abortion industry is not immediately apparent. The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his first wife who was an abortion supporter, focuses on college scholarships and the \"Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award.\" The foundation's website does not disclose the darker direction of the massive charity.\n\nThe site is deliberately insular, with copyrights on the pages dating back to 2008, and the charity making it clear that they only respond to inquiries about college scholarships and the \"Alice Buffett Outstanding Teacher Award.\"\n\nSince 2001, there has only been one tangential mention of Buffett's support for abortion on the broadcast TV network morning and evening news shows. It wasn't even about Buffett, but rather an NBC \"Nightly News\" obituary for his wife, which included her support for Planned Parenthood.\n\nDespite Buffett's significant donations to Planned Parenthood, he was never mentioned as a top donor when Live Action embarrassed Planned Parenthood with two videos of staffers assisting a Live Action actor with a possible sex selection abortion. The abortion provider also faced embarrassment in early 2011 when Live Action's Lila Rose trained investigators to pose as a pimp and a prostitute running a sex ring composed of 14- and 15-year-olds. Planned Parenthood workers were quite willing to help provide underage abortions.\n\nInstead, the media portrays Buffett as a grandfatherly, tax-hiking, and investor figure. As a reliable liberal businessman, journalists turn to him as a source for almost any commentary. It's easy to understand why, as giving $1,000 to a ballot initiative to defend traditional marriage is controversial, while giving $1.25 billion to promote abortion goes unnoticed by the media, which is wildly pro-abortion.\n\nHowever, as more information about Buffett's philanthropy becomes available, it will be interesting to see how the supposedly \"neutral\" news media handles the story.",
    " Title: The Real Reasons Behind the Stalled Immigration Reform in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate on immigration reform in the United States Congress has been stalled until 2015, and it is not due to the Syrian crisis, as some claim. Ruben Navarrette, a nationally syndicated columnist, argues that the real reasons for the stalled reform are more complex and multifaceted.\n\nFirst, the comprehensive immigration reform bill is not just on the back burner but is off the stove for the rest of this year. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives might vote on a \"reform-lite\" bill that offers legal status but not citizenship to illegal immigrants or legal status only to farm workers and DREAMers. However, any hope of a large-scale reform that offers legal status to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States has faded.\n\nSecond, the claim that the Syrian crisis pushed the immigration issue off the agenda is not accurate. The real reasons for the stalled reform are as follows:\n\n1. The major legislative offering, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, collapsed under its own weight. The bill, which was 844 pages long, became cumbersome and pork-laden during the amendment process, pushing it past 1,000 pages.\n\n2. The debate was always about politics instead of policy. Many of the giveaways had nothing to do with immigration but were merely intended to get the support of senators from various states.\n\n3. The debate has been inherently dishonest, with neither side able to trust the other. The debate divides the constituencies of both parties, and neither party really wanted to have this debate.\n\nIn conclusion, the immigration reform debate in Congress is not just about Syria or the border. It is about politics, dishonesty, and a lack of trust between the parties. The real reasons for the stalled reform are complex and multifaceted, and it is essential to understand these reasons to find a solution to the immigration issue in the United States.",
    " Title: Warren Buffett Laments Lack of Acquisition Opportunities, Seeks \"Huge\" Deals for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, billionaire investor Warren Buffett expressed his difficulty in finding suitable companies to buy for Berkshire Hathaway Inc, citing a \"purchasing frenzy\" by deal-hungry CEOs as a major reason for the conglomerate's accumulation of $116 billion in low-yielding cash and government bonds.\n\nThe letter, which was shorter than in previous years, did not discuss major Berkshire stock holdings such as Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Buffett typically invests in stocks when he cannot find whole companies to buy.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate reported a record $44.94 billion annual profit, though $29.1 billion stemmed from the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate, which reduced Berkshire's deferred tax liabilities. Book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 23 percent in 2017.\n\nBuffett, who is 87, has given himself and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, more freedom to focus on investing and allocating capital. The duo has not signaled any intention of stepping down soon, though Berkshire last month named two additional vice chairmen who could eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.\n\nGregory Abel, who had run Berkshire Hathaway Energy, is now overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, all of which employ 330,000 people. Insurance specialist Ajit Jain oversees the Geico auto insurer and other insurance businesses, employing 47,000.\n\nBuffett revealed in his letter that Berkshire was sitting at year-end on a $7.25 billion paper profit on what has become a 3.3 percent stake in Apple, worth $28.2 billion. Some Berkshire stock investments are made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who Buffett said together manage about $25 billion, up from $21 billion a year ago.\n\nBuffett also warned long-term investors that even with U.S. stock prices near record highs, it would be a \"terrible mistake\" to assume bonds are safer. \"Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk,\" he wrote.\n\nFourth-quarter net income quintupled to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of performance, fell more than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, and slid 18 percent for the year to $14.46 billion.\n\nFull-year results suffered from Berkshire's first full-year insurance underwriting loss since 2002, hurt by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and wildfires in California. Even so, insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, and which give Buffett more money to invest, rose 25 percent last year, to $114.5 billion.",
    " Title: Former Colorado Governor and 2020 Democratic Candidate John Hickenlooper Warns Against Embracing Socialism\n\nFormer Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has urged his party to steer clear of socialist policies as the Democratic nominee is chosen to challenge President Trump in the upcoming election.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Hickenlooper expressed his reservations about major policy proposals such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. He stated, \"If we don't stand up and say that we Democrats do not stand for socialism, we're going to end up reelecting the worst president this country has ever had.\"\n\nHickenlooper participated in NPR's Opening Arguments conversations, a series exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. He expressed his skepticism towards certain aspects of the Green New Deal, stating, \"I don't think we're going to address climate change by guaranteeing every American a federal job.\" He also questioned the feasibility of Medicare for All, stating, \"I don't think we're going to address the spiraling inflation in health care by forcibly telling 150 million people that we're going to take away their private insurance.\"\n\nHickenlooper acknowledged the importance of addressing income inequality, women's rights, and civil rights, but emphasized the need to focus on \"kitchen table issues\" such as job creation and economic stability. He stated, \"We've got to recognize to win in Ohio and Michigan and North Carolina and Wisconsin, we're going to have to get more to those kitchen table issues that have to do with somebody's job, or how many jobs they're having to work just to balance a household budget.\"\n\nHickenlooper emphasized his belief in the Democratic Party as a \"big-tent party\" that embraces opportunity for all people. He cited his record of bringing people together and accomplishing goals during his tenure as governor, including near-universal health care and economic growth. He concluded, \"I think in some ways I'm the only person running who has actually accomplished what everyone else is talking about.\"\n\nVictoria Whitley-Berry contributed to this story and produced for air.",
    " Title: Analysis: The Length of Mueller Report and Barr's Summary: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe release of Attorney General William Barr's four-page letter to congressional leaders on the conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report has sparked discussions about the length of the report and the accuracy of Barr's summary.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the Mueller report \"exceeds 300 pages,\" citing unidentified American officials with knowledge of the matter. However, the report could mean more than 300 pages, as Fox's Andrew Napolitano has claimed it is 700 pages long. The Times also noted that Ken Starr's Clinton-Lewinsky report was 445 pages long, last year's inspector-general report on the Clinton emails investigation was 500 pages, and the 9/11 Commission report was 567 pages.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr has not revealed the number of pages in the report to House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who has only said it is \"very substantial.\" When asked whether that means fewer than a thousand pages, Nadler replied, \"I would think so.\"\n\nThe page count of the report has become a topic of debate, with some suggesting that the length of the report implies deception in Barr's summary. However, as Jim Geraghty points out in today's Morning Jolt, lengthy reports often come with an executive summary that is just a few pages long. The attorney general did not undertake to summarize Mueller's full report; the purpose of his letter was to succinctly state Mueller's principal conclusions.\n\nThe attorney general has pledged to release the report in as complete a form as is legally and practically possible, in reasonably rapid fashion. The president seems to support release as well. In writing his summary, Barr presumably was operating under the assumption that the report would be released, and that the public and the media would compare his summary with the final document.\n\nThe grand-jury hurdle to disclosure that Barr cited is real, but the matter is more complicated than initially thought. The courts are deemed to have inherent authority to disclose beyond the purposes listed in Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, but this is a hot issue in the D.C. Circuit. The House, by a 420\u20130 margin, has already approved a resolution calling for the report to be made public, and the president has indicated he is fine with disclosure.\n\nFor now, the report's release is a matter of time, and it is expected that the report will be substantially disclosed sooner rather than later. The debate about the length of the report and the accuracy of Barr's summary may subside once the report is made public, and the public can make an informed judgment about the conclusions of the Mueller report.",
    " Title: Former Senator Jim Webb Calls for Democratic Party to Focus on White, Working-Class Voters\n\n Article:\n\n In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election, emphasized the need for the Democratic Party to reconnect with white, working-class voters and return to its roots of ensuring a voice for those who lack representation in power.\n\n \"The Democratic party could do very well by returning to its Franklin Roosevelt/Harry Truman/Andrew Jackson roots, where the focus of the party was making sure that all people who lack a voice in the corridors of power could have one through their elected representatives,\" Mr. Webb told NPR.\n\n He pointed out that the Democratic party has struggled to win over white working-class voters in recent elections, with candidates receiving less than 40% of the white vote in areas where they had traditionally won. Mr. Webb noted that this trend has been ongoing, not just since President Obama's election.\n\n \"I think that it's true that when you look at 270 electoral votes and how to get there, there were different calculations that took place in terms of how to do that, and I believe that the Democratic party should reach out to all people, regardless of their backgrounds,\" he said.\n\n Mr. Webb, a Vietnam veteran and former secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, served a single term in the U.S. Senate before stepping down. He has formed an exploratory committee as he weighs a 2016 run and has spoken and written throughout his career on the influence of his Scots-Irish ancestors on Appalachia.\n\n If he runs for president, NPR's Steve Inskeep said, there will be a point during the primary season where he would have to address why he should be the Democratic nominee instead of the current frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n \"I really don't have an answer for you on that,\" he replied. \"She has not announced that she's running; I have not announced that I'm running. If I were to run, it would not be sort of as a counter-point to her. I have issues that I care about, I want to put [them] on the table, and we'll see.\"\n\n Mr. Webb also touched on economic issues, stating that the recovery has not been equitable for all Americans, with the stock market tripling since April 2009, while wages have remained flat or even decreased for typical wage-earners. He also noted that loans to small businesses have been down.\n\n \"Those are the issues that I think need to be addressed\u2014we have to find ways to protect working people,\" he said.",
    " Title: Obamacare Premium Hikes in Key Senate Races: A Potential Factor in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming midterm elections, the impact of rising Obamacare premiums could play a significant role in the Senate races in Louisiana and Iowa. The Republican candidates in these states have seized upon the double-digit rate hikes for individual health insurance plans, using the increases as a political weapon against their Democratic opponents.\n\nIn Louisiana, Representative Bill Cassidy has criticized the double-digit increases for some insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, stating that these increases are \"another hurdle for families and businesses already struggling under the demands of Obamacare.\" In Iowa, Senate candidate Joni Ernst has used the sharp rate increases for two insurers to attack Democratic candidate Rep. Bruce Braley, accusing him of supporting a law that is causing premiums to rise.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Obamacare premiums are not rising everywhere. In most states, premiums for coverage in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges for 2015 are increasing at about the normal rate for health insurance throughout the country. In some places, they're even decreasing.\n\nThere are, however, a few states that are facing more extreme premium increases from some insurers, and Louisiana, Iowa, and Alaska are among them. Even in these states, not all insurers are raising rates significantly. For instance, in Louisiana, only rates for the insurers that are raising rates by 10 percent or more are being announced, creating an incomplete picture of the situation.\n\nIn an election year, a few states\u2014and a few insurers\u2014are all that's needed, particularly when they may serve to rekindle passions about a law that was already an Election Day concern for Democrats. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, who has studied the premium trends around the country, stated, \"In general, the premium increases have been pretty modest. But there are exceptions, and the exceptions happen to be in states with competitive races.\"\n\nRepublican strategists have been anticipating the big premium increases as an Obamacare \"October surprise.\" They've been informed for months through their GOP policy expert contacts that the rate hikes were a possibility, and that because of the timing of the next enrollment season\u2014it starts on Nov. 15\u2014the increases would become final around now.\n\nDemocrats are not overly concerned, as the issue is not dominating the airwaves. With the Louisiana and Iowa Republican Senate candidates, it's been press statements and Twitter for now\u2014although a conservative group did run a TV ad in Alaska that hit Sen. Mark Begich over the increases there.\n\nObama administration officials point out that even in the states with the biggest hikes, most customers won't see them. In Iowa, for example, premiums for the second-lowest-cost \"silver\" health insurance plans will go down by an average of 7 percent in Des Moines. They also note that the typical premiums for people who get Obamacare subsidies are pretty low to begin with. In Louisiana, for example, the average monthly premium was $68 this year for a \"silver\" plan.\n\nThe reason for the biggest rate hikes in competitive Senate races is not due to a conspiracy, but rather a result of the electoral math. The states with the biggest increases are usually the ones where political leaders have resisted the Affordable Care Act and haven't done well at enrollment. And some of those states just happen to have the most competitive Senate races. A study by PwC's Health Research Institute, which researched premium data in 38 states and the District of Columbia, found that the average increase across states was just 6 percent. Only eight states had double-digit increases\u2014but those states included Louisiana and Iowa, as well as Kansas, where Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is trying to head off a serious challenge from independent Greg Orman.",
    " Title: Obama Clarifies Scope of Executive Action on Immigration, Addresses Opposition and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a lively rally to celebrate his recent executive action on immigration, President Barack Obama emphasized on Friday that his actions do not apply to new undocumented immigrants. He stated, \"Borders mean something,\" clarifying that the action does not extend to individuals who have recently entered the country illegally.\n\nSpeaking at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, the President reiterated his call for Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration bill, which he believes would render his executive actions null and void. He dismissed the argument by the Republican party that his executive actions have made it more difficult to pass such a bill, stating, \"I didn't dissolve Parliament. That's not how our system works. I don't have a vote in Congress. Pass a bill. You don't need me to pass a bill.\"\n\nThe President signed two documents on Friday, directing federal agencies to carry out his executive actions, which include shielding more immigrants from potential deportation and focusing deportations more on individuals with criminal records.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, who vehemently oppose Mr. Obama's action, argue that it will encourage more illegal immigrants to come to the U.S. A surge of illegal child immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this year was, in part, due to the belief that they would not be returned to their homes in Central America.\n\nOutside the high school, protesters of the President's actions held signs that read \"Impeach Obama\" and \"No Amnesty.\" Some chanted, \"Worst president ever, Obama!\"\n\nThe President was interrupted at the rally several times with joyous chants of \"Si Se Puede\" (Yes We Can), a throwback to his presidential campaigns. He was also heckled at one point by a young man who apparently was complaining that the President's action did not include enough illegal immigrants, such as parents of children who have already received protection from deportation by Mr. Obama.\n\nAstrid Silva, a woman who qualified for Mr. Obama's deferred action plan because she came to the U.S. illegally as a child, introduced the President to the crowd. She criticized the inaction by the GOP on immigration, saying \"House Republicans have refused to help me keep my dreams alive.\"\n\nThe President acknowledged that his action is not only benefiting Hispanic immigrants but also other ethnicities. \"Not everybody who comes here is Latino,\" Mr. Obama said. \"I'm from Chicago. We've got some Irish immigrants whose papers are not in order. We've got some Polish immigrants whose papers are not in order. This is not just a Latino issue. This is an American issue.\"\n\nThe President also acknowledged that his legal advisers told him that his authority was limited on immigration. \"Not everything that we want to do, we can do,\" he said. \"We should be creating new programs for farm workers. We should be adding visas for the high-tech sector. We should be creating a pathway to citizenship. But only Congress can do that.\"\n\nThe President stated that he received many letters from Americans urging him not to take these actions. \"There are folks who are good, decent people who are worried about immigration,\" he said. \"They're worried that it changes the fabric of our country. They're worried about whether immigrants take jobs from hard-working Americans. And they're worried because they're feeling a lot of economic stress and they feel as if maybe they're the ones paying taxes and nobody else is taking responsibility.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Obama also said he received messages from people \"reminding me why we had to act.\" \"From American family members of hard-working immigrants who fear their families could be torn apart,\" he said. \"From dreamers, who had proudly stepped out of the shadows and were willing to live without fear, even though it was a big risk for them.

The data, provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by the progressive campaign group the Committee to Protect Medicare, raises the possibility that the protests could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to areas that have, so far, experienced relatively few infections.\n\nThe data, captured from opt-in cellphone apps, was analyzed by data scientists at the firm VoteMap. They created visualizations that tracked the movements of devices present at protests in late April and early May in five states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado, and Florida.\n\nIn Lansing, Michigan, after a 30 April protest in which armed protesters stormed the capitol building and state police were forced to physically block access to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, devices which had been present at the protest site can be seen returning to all parts of the state, from Detroit to remote towns in the state's north. One device visible in the data traveled to and from Afton, which is over 180 miles from the capital. Others reached, and some crossed, the Indiana border.\n\nIn the 48 hours following a 19 April \"Operation Gridlock\" protest in Denver, devices reached the borders of neighboring states including Wyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah. In Florida on 18 April, devices returned to all parts of the peninsula and up to the Georgia border. In Wisconsin on 24 April, devices returned to smaller towns like Green Bay and Wausau, and the borders of Minnesota and Illinois.\n\nFollowing the initial wave of anti-lockdown protests in April, epidemiologists warned that they could lead to a new surge in cases. In North Carolina in late April, one of the leaders of the state's anti-lockdown protests tested positive for Covid-19 but said she would attend future rallies.\n\nDr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, said that although \"it's hard to draw a straight line between devices, individuals at these protests, and cases,\" the data suggests that the protests may be epidemiologically significant events.\n\n\"The behavior we're seeing at protests carries a high risk of infection. We can see protesters are going from a highly concentrated event and then dispersing widely,\" he added.\n\nDavidson, who has run for Congress as a Democrat, said that neither he nor his advocacy group were currently affiliated with the Democratic party. The group is made up of more than 300 \"doctors who are concerned that the healthcare for their patients has become unaffordable.\"\n\nIn a series of widely shared videos and threads on Twitter, Davidson has criticized President Trump, and attempted to dispel what he calls the \"distrust in public health\" which \"Donald Trump has fomented in his movement.\"",
    " Title: Trump and Self-Pardoning: Legal Scholars, Giuliani, and the Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The question of whether the President of the United States has the power to pardon himself has been a topic of debate, with President Donald Trump recently stating on Twitter that he does have the absolute right to pardon himself. However, Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested that while constitutionally he could pardon himself, it is unlikely due to the potential political ramifications.\n\nIn a tweet on June 4, 2018, Trump stated, \"I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?\" This statement came amidst the ongoing Russia probe, which has been a dominant headline in recent months.\n\nGiuliani's comments are in response to a 20-page letter to special counsel Robert Mueller from Trump's former lawyer, John Dowd. The memo, which was recently leaked, states that it's impossible for a president to obstruct justice and furthermore, the president has the power to pardon.\n\nRepublican leaders, such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), suggest the issue is a distraction and it's time to wrap up this investigation. McCarthy stated, \"I don't know why we're walking through hypotheticals here in this process. The president has never said he would pardon himself.\"\n\nThe president's frustration with the nearly 13-month investigation boiled over on Twitter this weekend, with Trump tweeting, \"When will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, Trump and his team are preparing for the G7 summit where he faces tensions with Canada over recently implemented tariffs. Beyond that, there's the high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12.",
    " Title: Trump's Bipartisan Achievements: A Look at the President's Cross-Aisle Victories\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Donald Trump has successfully spearheaded the bipartisan push for federal prison reform, a victory that has earned him praise from both sides of the aisle. The FIRST STEP Act, now law, aims to reduce sentences for drug felonies and other non-violent crimes, limit the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, and allow prisoners to earn \"good time credits\" by participating in educational or training programs.\n\nThe President hailed the new law as a measure that will \"keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it.\" He also emphasized the potential cost savings, stating that billions of dollars will be saved.\n\nWhile the FIRST STEP Act has garnered the most attention, it is not the only bipartisan victory for President Trump this year. In July, he signed legislation to renew a federal workforce development program, allowing states to provide technical education and training for students to develop skills for good-paying jobs.\n\nIn September, President Trump brought Democrats and Republicans together to draft the Protecting Patients From Surprise Medical Bills Act. This law guards patients from unexpected out-of-network bills and prohibits providers from charging patients for the difference if their insurance does not pay the full price of a given service or procedure.\n\nIn October, the President signed sweeping legislation to confront the opioid crisis after the SUPPORT For Patients and Communities Act passed in the Senate 98-1. This law provides funding for treatment and recovery, increased security to keep dangerous drugs out of the country, monitoring of opioid prescriptions, and development of non-opioid painkillers, among other key provisions.\n\nThe Water Infrastructure Act, signed in the same month, ensures safe and secure drinking water systems across the nation and prevents a recurrence of the Flint, Michigan catastrophe. The bill received a nearly unanimous vote of 99-1 in the Senate.\n\nFar from being divisive, the Trump administration has produced a steady increase in bipartisan legislation\u2014a stark contrast to the sharp decrease in bipartisanship during the Obama era. According to a May report by Quorum, 70 percent of the bills signed into law from this Congress have had at least one Democrat and one Republican sponsor, the highest level of bipartisanship in 20 years.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, founder of the global investment firm SkyBridge Capital and a former White House communications director, commends the President's ability to work across party lines. He encourages Democrats to set aside their obstructionist ways for constructive purposes, stating that Americans benefit greatly when they do so. As they prepare to share power and responsibility for the agenda of Congress in the new year, they should keep this in mind.",
    " Title: US Intelligence Warns Bernie Sanders of Russian Interference in His Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a continuation of the ongoing Russian interference in US elections, US officials have reportedly warned Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, that Russia is attempting to help his campaign. The Washington Post first reported the news on Friday, with both Sanders and President Trump receiving the briefing.\n\nThe news follows reports that intelligence officials recently briefed Congress about Russian interference aimed at helping reelect Donald Trump. In response, Sanders stated, \"I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The details provided by The Washington Post are limited, stating only that both Sanders and President Trump were briefed on Russia's efforts.\n\nThis latest development is part of Russia's broader effort to cast democracies as feckless, ineffective, and corrupt, according to Jessica Brandt, head of policy and research for the Alliance for Securing Democracy.\n\nIn 2016, Russian misinformation agents and hackers worked to boost Trump's electoral chances while also supporting Sanders during the Democratic primary. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's definitive look at Russian interference concluded that the IRA's left-leaning accounts focused their efforts on denigrating Hillary Clinton and supporting either Sanders or Green Party candidate Jill Stein, at the expense of Clinton.\n\nThe 2020 playbook remains the same, with Russia's goal being to elevate Trump, play up that Sanders has been treated unfairly, and tear down the leading institutional Democrat \u2013 currently Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg. In 2016, the focus was on Jill Stein; in 2020, it is Tulsi Gabbard, who has not left the race and whom Russian media regularly praises.\n\nClint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studies Russian interference efforts, states, \"The Kremlin's strategy for a year has been very straightforward. They would like to see Trump reelected.\"\n\nRussia has already gone after Biden aggressively, likely hacking into Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company whose connection to Hunter Biden has been the focus of conspiratorial narratives by Trump and his allies. Moscow's disinformation efforts in support of Sanders once again focused on Iowa, whose caucus earlier this month was beset by technical difficulties (which, to be clear, have not been connected to foreign hacking).\n\nJessica Brandt of the Alliance for Securing Democracy notes, \"We saw Russia amplifying conspiracy theories suggesting that delays in reporting returns were part of an effort to deny Senator Sanders a clear win. We also saw them highlighting theories purporting murky ties between other candidates and the company that created the caucus app.\"\n\nWhile the activity tracked by the Alliance for Securing Democracy may not have led directly to the intel briefings being reported this week, it does speak to what experts say is Russia's ultimate goal, which is less about Sanders and more about promoting chaos. The point has always been to find democracy's loose seams and pull.",
    " Title: U.S. and North Korea Leaders Convene in Hanoi for Second Summit, Seeking Progress on Denuclearization\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have commenced their second summit in less than a year in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, with the U.S. aiming for tangible steps towards dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The two leaders will hold a one-on-one conversation followed by dinner on Wednesday evening, with aides and interpreters in attendance.\n\nPresident Trump arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday night, while Kim traveled by train from Pyongyang, crossing the border from China and completing the final leg of his 3,000-km journey by car. The leaders will be accompanied by two aides and interpreters during dinner, with further discussions scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe summit follows their historic meeting in Singapore last June, which marked the first encounter between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. This time, there is pressure to move beyond the vague commitment made by Kim to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nCritics of Trump at home have urged caution against striking a deal that would not significantly curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, demanding specific, verifiable actions from North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons. In return, Kim is expected to seek significant U.S. concessions, such as relief from sanctions and a formal end to the Korean War.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday and met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh for talks. The summit is taking place amid increased pressure on Trump domestically, and he is eager to demonstrate progress on a foreign policy issue that has stumped previous administrations.\n\nSome analysts fear that this pressure may lead Trump to make concessions that could compromise U.S. security. The leaders' discussions in Hanoi will be closely watched, as the international community awaits a clearer understanding of what denuclearization entails for both parties.\n\nThe summit is also taking place against the backdrop of domestic issues in the U.S., with Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testifying before U.S. congressional committees, and the anticipated release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.",
    " Title: Rise of Second Amendment Purists within the National Rifle Association Challenges Established Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn May, approximately 100 protesters, many adorned with T-shirts bearing the slogan \"NRA = Not Real Activists,\" marched through the National Rifle Association's (NRA) annual meeting in Dallas. The demonstrators criticized the gun lobby for being too lenient on gun rights and rallied for Adam Kraut, a gun rights lawyer who fell short of the 71,000 votes needed for election but garnered 5,000 more votes than the previous year. This surge in support for Kraut is indicative of the growing influence of Second Amendment purists, often referred to as \"gundamentalists,\" within the NRA.\n\nThe NRA's internal pressure from this little-known force is demanding that the leadership refrain from conceding any ground to gun-control advocates, a move that could potentially jeopardize the association's ability to retain moderate supporters and make compromises to ward off stricter gun control measures.\n\nRichard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist, described the gundamentalists as having a disproportionately significant impact within the gun-rights movement. The NRA, which boasts five million members and is closely aligned with the Republican Party, has faced internal strife before, with the 1977 meeting in Cincinnati marking a turning point that transformed the once polite, sport-shooting organization into a political lobby.\n\nThe NRA leadership has reportedly obstructed Kraut's election through bylaws that make it difficult for non-nominating committee candidates to secure a seat on the board, as well as by enlisting a senior member to campaign against him. Marion Hammer, a past NRA president and one of the group's most successful lobbyists, criticized unsanctioned candidates in a column on Ammoland, though she did not name Kraut, who was one of only two non-approved candidates to run.\n\nThe Dallas protesters, primarily white men, included bearded outdoorsmen and libertarians. Adam Kraut, a 31-year-old gun rights proponent who practices firearms law in suburban Philadelphia and hosts a video blog, has campaigned for the NRA to advocate for more expansive gun-rights laws and to renew its leadership through changes to bylaws, such as imposing term limits for board members and mandatory meeting attendance.\n\nKraut's supporters, such as Tim Harmsen, who led the pro-Kraut march through the convention center, have criticized the NRA for being weak on gun laws. Harmsen stated, \"We're going to continue to apply pressure (on the NRA) every way that we can through social media and we'll be there again next year.\"\n\nThe gun-rights purists are adamant in their belief that the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment grants them the right to keep and bear arms. They oppose any form of gun control, arguing that criminals will find ways around gun laws, leaving law-abiding citizens without the means for self-defense and protection against state tyranny.\n\nThe gundamentalists are outraged by any concessions the NRA makes in response to mass shootings, even if these concessions are intended to avoid stricter gun control laws. Opinion polls, such as a regular Gallup survey, show growing support for gun control in recent years. However, support for gun control typically spikes immediately after mass shootings and then falls closer to pre-massacre levels within a few months.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting that claimed 58 lives in 2017, the NRA supported federal regulation of bump stocks, accessories used by the gunman to fire his semiautomatic rifles more rapidly. The Justice Department then ordered an effective ban that is close to being finalized. In response to the Florida high school shooting that left 17 dead in February, the NRA endorsed strengthening background checks for gun purchasers and emergency protection orders that allow law-enforcement officials to temporarily take guns away from people deemed dangerous.\n\nFor the gundamentalists, some of the actions taken by the NRA headquarters are considered \"outrageous and abhorrent.\" Jeff Knox, a Kraut supporter whose father, Neal Knox, led the \"Revolt at Cincinnati\" in 1977, expressed his disapproval, stating, \"It's: Holy cow, what are these guys thinking?\" The NRA and Marion Hammer did not respond to requests for comment regarding the influence of the gundamentalists and the criticism directed at the lobby.",
    " Title: Analysis: Political Divide Over Durham Investigation and Trump-Russia Probe, Iran-US Tensions, and National Security Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the appointment of U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe has sparked a contentious debate, with the left viewing it as politically motivated, while the right maintains the initial investigation was unwarranted. The right argues that the investigation, which uncovered numerous contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians, was necessary due to the potential for Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Trump administration's contacts with Russians included his son, son-in-law, campaign chairman, personal lawyer, future national security adviser, and future attorney general, among others. While the definition of 'collusion' may be debated, counterintelligence investigators saw signs of potential Russian influence. The investigators maintained secrecy until after the election to avoid affecting its outcome, a fact that contradicts the Republican theory of a biased investigation aimed at destroying Donald Trump.\n\nTrump supporters point to the Steele Dossier, a largely unconfirmed report on early Russian efforts to influence Trump, as evidence of partisan bias. However, the FISA application disclosed that the Steele Dossier had received funding from those seeking to discredit the Trump campaign, and the surveillance on Carter Page was renewed multiple times, including by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. Moreover, Russian spies had previously attempted to recruit Page.\n\nThe most charitable interpretation of Attorney General William Barr's behavior in defense of Trump is a belief in a 'unitary executive,' where the president can order any investigation he wants. However, in his quest to protect the presidency, Barr is damaging our national security. His complicity in Trump's efforts to disparage the FBI will make it more difficult for agents to do their jobs and could discourage investigations of those in power.\n\nMeanwhile, the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military leader, has raised strategic questions about the potential for a U.S.-Iran war. Soleimani was not a terror kingpin, and his death does not decapitate anything. The main question is not moral or legal\u2014it's strategic. The only reason to kill Soleimani is to enter a new war that the United States can win, but no one seems to have thought past the action itself.\n\nThe U.S. has declared airstrikes as its response to any attacks on American targets or assets, but Iran relies on a network of proxy actors. It remains unclear if these proxy forces will respect Trump's red line, making violent conflict more likely. Influential Republican senators like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and Mitch McConnell are urged to remind Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and prevent further escalation with Iran.",
    " Title: Graham Threatens to Delay Obama's Defense and CIA Nominees Over Benghazi Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) \u2013 Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominees for secretary of defense and CIA director, John Brennan and Chuck Hagel, unless the White House provides more information about its response to the September attack on an American diplomatic post in Libya.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS on Sunday, Graham used the phrase \"no confirmation without information\" to vow to put a hold on the nominations, stating, \"I do not think we should allow Brennan to go forward with the CIA directorship, Hagel to be confirmed for secretary of defense, until the White House gives us an accounting.\"\n\nGraham's previous threat involved putting a hold on Hagel's nomination unless outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified before Congress on the Benghazi attacks. Panetta testified last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, stating that without direct warning or advance intelligence of the September 11, 2012, attack, there was no way for the military to respond in time.\n\nGraham, along with other Republicans, has also criticized the Obama administration's immediate response to the attack, particularly the appearance of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice less than a week later on Sunday talk shows, where she blamed the attack on anger generated by an anti-Muslim video.\n\nRice has explained her remarks as derived from administration talking points, which Graham said Sunday had not yet been sufficiently explained. \"I want to know who changed the talking points. Who took the references to al Qaeda out of the talking points given to Susan Rice?\" said Graham, who specified that he would not filibuster the nominees but rather hold them up until more information is disclosed.\n\nSen. John McCain, a close Republican ally of Graham's in the Senate, said Monday he would not support a filibuster of Hagel, which would be unprecedented for a president's Cabinet nominee.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Sunday in response to Graham's comments that the White House believes \"the Senate should act swiftly to confirm John Brennan and Sen. Hagel. These are critical national security positions, and individual members should not play politics with their nominations.\"",
    " Title: Vacant Diplomatic Posts Pose Challenges for Trump Administration Amidst International Crises\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of escalating international crises, the absence of ambassadors in key countries such as South Korea, China, and Japan is causing concern. As Evelyn Cheng points out at CNBC, the United States currently lacks ambassadors in these countries, as well as in India and Australia. The State Department is facing more than 100 senior position vacancies.\n\nThe Trump administration's inability to fill these positions is causing delays in the confirmation process, with nominees for the Tokyo embassy only being selected in March and still not confirmed, and no nominee for South Korea as of Friday. The nomination for the Beijing embassy foundered in the Senate due to the Trump administration's inability to complete necessary paperwork.\n\nThe lack of ambassadors in these crucial regions is raising questions about the Trump administration's ability to handle international crises effectively. The desire to \"run the government like a business\" is a tradition in American political life, but the government is not a business, and it makes little sense to try to run it as such.\n\nDonald Trump, as a businessman with a populist streak, has been criticized for his lack of experience in running large organizations. His few attempts to run large businesses, such as the Trump Taj Mahal and the Plaza Hotel, ended in bankruptcy. Trump's career has primarily consisted of licensing deals and media deals, rather than running a large corporation like Microsoft or Ford.\n\nThe skills of a business executive are not necessarily transferable to the public sector, and especially not to the presidency. The president proposes a policy agenda and works to forge a political consensus to support it, working with Congress to implement it through legislation. Trump is not doing that. Instead, he is putting on public spectacles and tweeting.\n\nThe Trump administration's inability to fill key diplomatic positions is causing delays in the implementation of policy and is raising questions about the administration's ability to handle international crises effectively. The lack of personnel in key positions is hindering the administration's ability to implement its policy agenda and is causing delays in the confirmation process for nominees. The proverb \"personnel is policy\" rings true in this case, as the Trump administration's policy is, for the moment, not to have a policy.",
    " Title: \"Five Instances of Disagreement Between President Trump and His Family Members in the White House\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between President Donald Trump and his family members, particularly his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been a subject of media attention due to their reported disagreements with the President on various issues.\n\nRecently, it was reported by The New York Times that Kushner and Ms. Trump had urged the President to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, more forcefully. This comes after President Trump's response to the events, which was criticized by many.\n\nThis is not the first time the power couple has reportedly expressed displeasure with the President's actions. Here are five other instances:\n\n1. In October, a tape of President Trump making crude comments about women in 2005 was leaked to The Washington Post. According to The New York Times, Ivanka Trump made an emphatic case for a full-throated apology from her father, with her eyes reportedly welling with tears and her face reddening as she hurried out in frustration.\n\n2. When President Trump announced that the U.S. would pull back from the Paris climate agreement, it was reported that Ivanka and Jared were not pleased. Politico reported that the pair were taking it in their stride, but their view of their roles in the White House is that they're playing the long game, helping the President to be successful.\n\n3. In January, Vanity Fair reported that Kushner was \"furious\" that his efforts were being \"undermined\" by the President. The outlet pointed to a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which Kushner was trying to arrange. When Trump tweeted that it would be better to cancel the meeting if Mexico was unwilling to pay for the wall, the meeting was canceled.\n\n4. In February, news reached Politico that the pair helped kill off an order that would have overturned a 2014 Obama-era executive order preventing LGBT discrimination in the workplace. The White House downplayed the move, saying it was one of hundreds of draft orders being considered.\n\n5. When President Trump tweeted that he would not allow trans-identifying people to serve in the military, a number of people within the White House were reportedly shocked. Again, it didn't take long for news to hit mainstream media outlets that Kushner and Ms. Trump were shocked also. According to Politico, Kushner and Ms. Trump were \"blindsided\" by the tweet, with Ivanka reportedly learning of the decision \"when she saw her father's tweet on her phone.\"\n\nAdam Shaw, a politics reporter based in New York, reported on these instances for The \u2588\u2588\u2588.

    " Title: The State of American Political Parties: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current state of the American political landscape is a subject of much debate and concern. Two major parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, are in the spotlight, each grappling with their own set of challenges.\n\nFor the Republican Party, the control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives has brought increased scrutiny. The party's internal issues, however, have been likened to a dry Slip 'N Slide made from sandpaper, with ideological, political, and structural problems compounded by the unpredictable nature of the current president.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic Party appears to be in a state of disarray, with its focus largely on opposition to the current administration. The party's internal issues have been highlighted in a forthcoming book by Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the party before the 2016 election. Brazile alleges that the party was in significant debt and that Hillary Clinton effectively took control, with the Clinton campaign raising funds ostensibly for the party but sluicing them back into the campaign's coffers.\n\nThe Democratic Party's unifying principle seems to be opposition to Donald Trump, but when it comes to ideas about governing, the party appears divided between the ideology of Bernie Sanders and the identity politics popular on college campuses and certain left-wing websites.\n\nThe state of the parties is a reflection of the broader political climate, with many Americans seeking change and disruption, as seen in the rise of companies like Uber and Amazon. Whether the political parties will crumble under this wave of creative destruction, as other institutions have, remains to be seen. However, the current state of the parties has led some to question whether they have it coming, given their internal strife and lack of clear, unifying ideas.",
    " Title: \"The Role of Evaluation Apprehension in Political Opinion Polling: A Look at the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the world of politics, perceptions and realities often diverge, much like the fictional world of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Pirates of Penzance.\" This disconnect is not only present in our daily interactions but also in opinion polling, particularly when it comes to political preference.\n\nRecently, there has been a growing debate about the accuracy of election polls, with many suggesting that they were tainted by a degree of disingenuousness. In a previous article published in this journal, I argued that this false self-report was influenced by a psychological phenomenon known as \"evaluation apprehension\" (EA).\n\nEA, a term coined by the author, refers to an anxiety-induced concern about being positively or negatively judged. This state can influence the responses given in opinion surveys, particularly when the subject is political. The near-unanimous rejection and derogation of Donald Trump by the media during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign could have triggered EA, especially among those who favored or leaned toward Trump but were reluctant to voice their preference.\n\nAnother factor that compounded the problem was the release of the infamous Access Hollywood video on October 7, 2016, which showed Trump making controversial comments about his sexual behavior. The subsequent dip in Trump's poll numbers was expected, but his rebound after a few days indicated a connection with a significant segment of the voting public that the pollsters and commentators are only now beginning to understand or acknowledge.\n\nImproving the understanding of public opinion polling among political journalists could help mitigate such errors. If journalists had a more nuanced understanding of polling, they would not be so quick to make sweeping statements or call for harsh actions, such as Chris Matthews' suggestion to \"tar and feather all of the pollsters.\"\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the error limits calculated statistically in polls reflect sampling errors, discarded respondents, quota excesses, or poor interviewer performance. These errors are typically random rather than one-sided. However, the activation of EA can cause a one-sided tilt in the data, a bias that is not easily accounted for in quick cell phone conversations with respondents.\n\nAs a social psychologist, I write these words to shed light on a methodological issue. However, the underlying question remains: why did half of the electorate, a demographic that was more male, less coastal, less college-educated, and less wealthy, enable a candidate like Donald Trump to come so close to the windmills of power? This question, beyond the realm of methodology, is one that future historians and present journalists will grapple with, as they seek to understand the complexities of human behavior and the political landscape.",
    " Title: Trump to Outline 'Renewal of American Spirit' in Joint Address, Focusing on Economic Opportunity and National Security\n\nIn a bid to reset his first month in office, President Donald Trump is set to deliver a joint address to Congress on Tuesday, outlining his plans for a \"renewal of the American spirit\" through economic goals and priorities. The speech is expected to strike an optimistic tone, with the President aiming to address real issues and provide solutions for the American people.\n\nAccording to senior administration officials, the President will use the theme of renewal to present his vision for the nation and explain how his administration intends to tackle pressing problems. He is expected to assert that Americans have been waiting for political leadership for too long, but help is now on the way.\n\nThe speech comes amid a tumultuous first month in office for President Trump, marked by backlash over his immigration and travel ban, struggles to formulate a replacement health care plan if Obamacare is repealed, turnover with his national security adviser, and allegations of ties between his administration and Russia.\n\nAs of Monday evening, the President was still working with speechwriters to finalize the speech. The speech, unlike his inaugural address that painted a dark picture of American carnage, is the product of listening sessions and meetings with health care professionals, law enforcement, union representatives, coal miners, and others.\n\nThe speech will focus on two key areas: growing economic opportunity and protecting the American people. In an interview on Fox News, President Trump attributed messaging problems for his rocky first month in office, stating, \"I think I get an A in terms of what I've actually done, but in terms of messaging, I'd give myself a C or a C+.\"\n\nThe President also expressed confidence that a revved-up economy would fund the $54 billion dollar increase he's proposing in defense spending. \"I mean you look at the kind of numbers we're doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1 percent and if I can get that up to 3 or maybe more, we have a whole different ball game. It's a whole different ball game,\" he said. The Commerce Department puts the GDP at 1.6% for 2016.\n\nSenior administration officials described Tuesday's speech as an optimistic look forward to what Trump hopes to accomplish in office. The President will also review the promises he made to the American people and argue for what he has kept so far, pointing to his executive orders and memos.\n\nNational security and foreign policy will also be a significant part of the speech. Following the halt of his travel ban by a federal court, President Trump is expected to issue another executive order this week with more detail and direction, avoiding the impact on green card holders.",

Rand Paul Questions U.S. Accountability for Election Interference, Emphasizes Need for Electoral Security\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) expressed his view that it is a mistake to seek accountability from Russia for its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, suggesting that such actions are common among nations with the means to meddle in foreign elections.\n\n\"They're another country. They're going to spy on us. They do spy on us. They're going to interfere in our elections. We also do the same,\" Sen. Paul stated. He further emphasized the importance of ensuring the integrity of U.S. elections, stating, \"What we need to do is make sure our electoral process is protected.\"\n\nSen. Paul also suggested that from Russia's perspective, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, was responsible for some meddling during the Obama administration. However, he clarified that he was not equating the two in terms of moral equivalence.\n\nAhead of President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, Sen. Paul expressed doubt that the Russians would admit their actions, comparing it to the U.S.'s reluctance to admit its influence in campaigns in other countries' elections.\n\nSen. Paul commended the recent indictment of 12 Russian military officers for allegedly stealing Democratic emails and interfering in the 2016 election, but expressed the belief that the Department of Justice could have investigated the matter without a special counsel. He stated, \"If we have proof that they did it, which it sounds we did, we should now spend our time protecting ourselves instead of sort of having this witch hunt on the president.\"\n\nSen. Paul also stated that there is \"no evidence\" so far that President Trump has been personally involved in the election interference. He concluded by expressing the need to move past the investigation and focus on protecting U.S. elections from foreign interference.",
    " Title: Texas State Troopers Implement New Policy to Gather Accurate Ethnicity Data from Motorists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to rectify a long-standing issue of misidentification during traffic stops, Texas state troopers have begun asking motorists their race and ethnicity. This change was implemented after it was discovered that drivers, particularly those of Hispanic descent, were often misidentified due to flaws in an automated system designed to prevent racial profiling.\n\nAccording to a statement by Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw, the new policy took effect on Wednesday, with the aim of collecting data more accurately. McCraw expressed, \"What we can do better, and what we should have been doing better, is collect the data accurately as it relates to Hispanics. Plain and simple... I would rather a trooper not have to ask, but if the data doesn't work... there is a problem.\"\n\nKXAN-TV in Austin conducted a review of DPS records spanning from 2010 and found that troopers across the state inaccurately reported the race of Hispanic drivers. The television station's investigation of DPS traffic citation records also showed that the number of drivers stopped by troopers and recorded as Hispanic has increased annually since 2010, while the number of drivers recorded as white has decreased.\n\nThe review of DPS records also revealed that among the most common surnames of drivers listed by troopers as white are Garcia, Martinez, Hernandez, Gonzalez, and Rodriguez. However, more than 1.9 million drivers with traditionally Hispanic names were listed as white, while approximately 1.6 million were reported as Hispanic.\n\nTo prevent racial profiling, state law requires authorities to document the race of drivers who are arrested, issued warnings, or citations. However, McCraw testified that the coding on driver's licenses only allowed for identification as Hispanic since 2010. Prior to that time, Hispanic motorists were often identified as white.\n\nMcCraw could not provide an estimate of the cost to fix the automated system, leaving no other remedy but to direct troopers to specifically ask for the information. A DPS memo outlining the new policy states, \"Officers will advise the individual that the officer is required by law to inquire as to the individual\u2019s race or ethnicity. Officers will record the race or ethnicity as stated by the motorist.\"\n\nDespite the current lack of data, McCraw maintained that the agency does not tolerate racial profiling. \"Bottom line, it's against the law,\" he said. \"There is no racial profiling within the DPS.\"",
    " Title: Facebook Apologizes for Flagging Declaration of Independence as Hate Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Facebook has issued an apology to the Liberty County Vindicator after flagging a post containing text from the United States Declaration of Independence as \"hate speech.\" The Texas-based newspaper had been sharing the Declaration of Independence in parts on their Facebook page, only for the tenth part to be removed by the social media giant.\n\nThe offending text, as identified by Facebook, was a passage that described the actions of the British monarch during the American Revolution:\n\n\"He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\"\n\nCasey Stinnett, managing editor of the Liberty County Vindicator, suspects that the term \"Indian Savages\" may have triggered Facebook's filtering program. He described the censorship as an \"automated action.\"\n\nStinnett wrote, \"This is frustrating, but your editor is a historian, and to enjoy the study of history a person must love irony. It is a very great irony that the words of Thomas Jefferson should now be censored in America.\"\n\nFacebook's mistake has sparked a conversation about the nuances of language and the potential for automated systems to misinterpret historical context. The social media giant has yet to comment further on the matter.",
    " Title: Ronan Farrow and Matt Lauer Clash Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Upcoming Book \"Catch and Kill\"\n\nArticle:\n\nRonan Farrow, the investigative journalist, made his first television appearance since the release of excerpts from his upcoming book, \"Catch and Kill,\" which contains new details about Matt Lauer's 2017 firing from NBC. In an interview on \"Good Morning America,\" Farrow stood by his book, which is set to be released next week, despite Lauer's claims that the reporting in \"Catch and Kill\" is false and defamatory.\n\nDuring the interview, Farrow alleged that there were previous accusations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer at NBC, prior to the 2017 complaint that led to his dismissal. Farrow, however, declined to reveal specific details about his sources or whether he had spoken with Lauer. He did state that Lauer's \"way of thinking\" is represented in the book, and everything printed in the book has been \"extensively fact-checked.\"\n\nNBC released a statement regarding the rape allegation in Farrow's book, stating that Lauer was fired within 24 hours of NBC learning about the complaint in 2017, and that any suggestions of NBC trying to cover up for Lauer are \"false and offensive.\"\n\nFarrow claimed that he spent years reporting and fact-checking the claims made in his book, and what he found contradicts NBC's statement. He said, over a six to seven-year period, there were seven non-disclosure agreements at the network, multiple of which involved Lauer. Farrow also added that he spoke with NBC senior executives who were made aware of those earlier settlements.\n\nIn response to Farrow's \"Good Morning America\" interview, NBC issued a statement reiterating NBC News Chairman Andy Lack's memo, which stated that the first NBC heard about allegations of sexual misconduct against Lauer was on the night of November 27, 2017, and he was fired 24 hours after. The statement added that NBC Universal's legal team has conducted interviews and an exhaustive search of available records and found no claims or settlements that suggest inappropriate conduct by Lauer prior to his 2017 firing.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was reported that Farrow's book includes new details about the allegation that caused Lauer's firing. Brooke Nevils, the previously unnamed accuser at the center of Lauer's fall from grace, is identified in the book, and \"Catch and Kill\" delves into details of Nevils' allegation that Lauer raped her during the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nIn a letter provided by his lawyer to Variety, Lauer denied the allegation and painted the picture of an accusation full of contradictions. He said he has remained silent until now to protect his children but has now decided to speak out against the \"false and salacious allegations\" against him.\n\n\"I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period,\" Lauer wrote. \"My silence has been a mistake. Old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous.\"\n\nNevils stepped forward with a tweet Wednesday. \"I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support,\" she wrote. \"It takes courage, and I am truly grateful.\"\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, she said she asked NBC to thoroughly investigate her allegations and to give Lauer \"the opportunity to defend himself.\" She also said she provided \"dates, times, evidence of communications and corroborating accounts\" to back up her accusations and \"both NBC and Farrow found me credible.\"\n\nNevils continued, \"There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence. His open letter was a case study in victim blaming... I am not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Call for Disciplinary Action Following Inspector General's Report on Operation Fast and Furious\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a damning report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, Republican lawmakers are demanding accountability and disciplinary action for multiple officials involved in the botched Operation Fast and Furious. The report, which faulted several agencies for their handling of the anti-gunrunning operation, has led to the resignation of one Justice Department official and the retirement of another. Fourteen additional officials have been forwarded for potential disciplinary action.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified that all 14 officials should leave the department, a call echoed by other lawmakers. The scrutiny has particularly focused on criminal division chief Lanny Breuer, with some lawmakers suggesting he should face discipline.\n\nThe report accused officials of a \"disregard\" for public safety and marked the most comprehensive account yet of the deadly operation that allowed weapons to \"walk\" across the U.S.-Mexico border, resulting in hundreds of firearms turning up at crime scenes in both countries.\n\nThe report stated that Attorney General Eric Holder was not made aware of potential flaws in the program until February of last year. However, lawmakers pointed to a section of the findings that suggested wiretap applications should have raised \"red flags\" for those who reviewed them, contradicting Holder's earlier testimony this year.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said, \"Sadly, the Department of Justice was not vindicated.\" He further stated, \"I just... can't imagine a headline that reads... 'passengers charged with speeding, driver exonerated.'\"\n\nThe report criticized a range of agencies and officials, including Lanny Breuer for not notifying Holder about Operation Wide Receiver, the prior Bush-era gunwalking investigation, when he first learned about it in 2010.\n\nThe IG report also criticized flaws in Operation Wide Receiver, the Bush administration-era predecessor to Fast and Furious. The report concluded that the affidavits in both cases included information that would have caused a prosecutor who was focused on the question of investigative tactics to have questions about ATF's conduct of the investigations.\n\nAttorney General Holder stated that those found responsible for roles in the operation \"have been referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions.\" The department, however, could not reveal more details at this time.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers and the inspector general joined in assailing the entire operation as misguided and poorly supervised. The report has sparked a call for more documents and further disciplinary action in the wake of the Fast and Furious scandal.",
    " Title: US to Rejoin WHO as Biden Promises Reversal of Trump's Decision; WHO Acknowledges Airborne Transmission of Covid-19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the US is officially out of the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 for now. The Trump administration has notified the UN of its withdrawal from the global health body, citing its perceived closeness to China and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden has pledged to reverse this decision should he win in November, aiming to \"restore our leadership on the world stage.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the administration's top infectious disease expert, stated this week that the country is \"still knee-deep in the first wave\" of the pandemic, with over 131,000 deaths and infection numbers rising at a rate of around 50,000 per day. In a stark contrast to Donald Trump's migration rhetoric, some border towns in northern Mexico are now trying to stop people crossing from the US, out of fear they could spread the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has insisted he's \"doing fine\" after testing positive for Covid-19. Like Trump, Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for his response to the disease, which has claimed more lives in Brazil than in any other country besides the US.\n\nThe WHO has acknowledged fresh evidence of airborne transmission of the virus, stating that Covid-19 may spread more widely in the air than previously suggested. Additionally, Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms could suffer serious brain disorders, according to neurologists who have studied 40 UK patients with complications ranging from brain inflammation to strokes.\n\nIn other news, the US government is attempting to reclaim the $80 million it loaned to Planned Parenthood under the coronavirus aid program, following criticism from conservative lawmakers. However, Christian anti-abortion groups have also received millions in taxpayer-backed loans, a move that one expert on the US religious right describes as \"a lightyear leap into direct government financing of major Christian right political entities on a scale we've never seen before.\"\n\nSome 5,600 fossil fuel companies have collectively accepted $3 billion in federal coronavirus aid amid the crisis, according to an analysis by Documented and \u2588\u2588\u2588. Kanye West's company Yeezy LLC received between $2 million and $5 million in coronavirus aid loans, raising questions about conflict of interest, given the rapper and designer's ties to the Trump administration.\n\nIn a forthcoming book, Donald Trump's niece, Mary Trump, describes the Trump family as \"malignantly dysfunctional\" and claims that the president's character traits, such as narcissism, bullying, and grandiosity, are shaped by the emotional abuses of his father, Fred, who was a \"high-functioning sociopath.\"\n\nThe FBI has claimed that China is pursuing hundreds of Chinese nationals living in the US, trying to force dissidents and critics of the Beijing government to return home. In Hong Kong, the unofficial pro-democracy anthem Glory to Hong Kong has been banned in schools amid sweeping new national security laws imposed from Beijing.\n\nMore than 3.5 million people have been advised to evacuate in Japan, after torrential rains and flooding that have already claimed at least 58 lives. Facebook boycott organizers are \"disappointed\" after a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, in which the social network's CEO and other executives failed to commit to concrete solutions for addressing hate speech and misinformation on the platform.\n\nChechens across Europe are fearful following the killings of several dissidents and critics of the Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov. The latest victim is 43-year-old Mamikhan Umarov, who was shot dead in Vienna on Saturday.\n\nNine in ten Americans say racism and police brutality are problems in the country, according to a poll conducted by Opinium for \u2588\u2588\u2588, suggesting Trump is increasingly out of step with public opinion.\n\nFinally, Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite arrested last week on sex trafficking charges over her association with the late Jeffrey Epstein, has been photographed with a number of high-profile individuals, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Princess Diana, and others. These photographs are chronicled by a popular new Instagram account.",
    " Title: House Approves Nonbinding War Powers Resolution to Limit Trump's Military Actions Against Iran\n\nThe House of Representatives has passed a nonbinding war powers resolution that requires President Trump to seek Congressional approval before engaging in new military actions against Iran. The vote, which was mostly along party lines, comes a week after the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general and escalated tensions with Tehran.\n\nThe resolution, sponsored by Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), was approved by a vote of 224-194. Only three Republicans and one independent joined Democrats to pass the measure, while eight Democrats opposed it. The Senate could consider a similar measure, with the force of law, as early as next week, but its success in the chamber is uncertain.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains that the president already has the authority to take action against Iran under a 2002 war authorization passed by Congress in response to the September 11 attacks. In response to the vote, the White House stated that the president \"has the right and duty to protect this nation and our citizens from terrorism.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressed her support for the resolution, stating, \"What this does is very important for the security of this country.\" The measure was written as a concurrent resolution, which is traditionally considered nonbinding and does not require the president's signature.\n\nThe concerns over war powers touch on a years-long discussion over the outdated nature of the president's war powers. Under the Trump administration, Democrats and some Republicans have renewed calls for new legislation addressing the president's authorization for use of military force.\n\nCongress has debated crafting a new AUMF specifically focused on Iran, but has failed to reach consensus on language that would satisfy the broad ideological spectrum that wants the legislative branch to reassert its power to declare war.\n\nSome Senate Republicans have expressed interest in supporting a similar measure in their chamber. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who is sponsoring the war powers resolution, could bring up his measure for a vote as early as Tuesday. However, it may have to be coordinated with a potential trial if articles of impeachment are sent to the chamber.",
    " Title: Trump and Bloomberg's Presidential Race: A Battle of Words and Ad Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump took aim at former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, claiming that if Bloomberg does not win the Democratic presidential nomination, the billionaire businessman will spend \"very little of his money\" to help the eventual nominee defeat Trump. This prediction appears to contradict plans by an allied Bloomberg group to spend millions attacking Trump over the airwaves, regardless of whether Bloomberg wins the nomination.\n\nTrump's tweets accused Bloomberg of playing poker with his Democratic rivals, suggesting that he would remain silent if he loses the primaries and not hit Trump hard during his campaign. In response, Bloomberg tweeted, \"Obsessed much? It shouldn't be this easy to distract the President of the United States.\"\n\nBloomberg has repeatedly stated that he would back the eventual nominee, regardless of whether he captures the nomination. In a statement to NBC News, Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, said, \"Mike Bloomberg is either going to be the nominee or the most important person supporting the Democratic nominee for president. He is dedicated to getting Trump out of the White House.\"\n\nBloomberg, through a super PAC, went up in November with a massive $100 million ad buy to run digital spots attacking the president in the crucial general election battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. The ads, which will run through the end of the primary season, do not feature Bloomberg beyond the legally required disclaimers.\n\nIn his tweet, Bloomberg also linked to a Mediaite story on a new TV commercial by Bloomberg that refers to an alleged incident in which Trump verbally attacked military leaders in a Pentagon briefing. The narrator in the ad calls Trump \"an erratic and out of control president.\"\n\nBloomberg flirted with a White House run early last year but decided against launching a campaign in March, feeling he and former Vice President Joe Biden would split the center-left Democratic vote. However, in late November, with Biden battling other top-tier contenders Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as then-South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Bloomberg jumped into the race, citing concerns that none of the current candidates could defeat Trump in next year's election. He has already spent a quarter-billion dollars to run ads on behalf of his White House bid.",
    " Title: President Obama Vows to Push Forward with Immigration Executive Order Despite Republican Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a defiant move, President Barack Obama has vowed to implement an executive order aimed at easing immigration laws before the end of the year, disregarding stern warnings from Republican leaders that such a move could strain his relationship with the incoming Republican-led Congress.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" the President stated his intention to grant legal status to most of the estimated 11 million undocumented residents living in the U.S. He acknowledged his preference for Congress to address the issue, but expressed frustration over the delay in addressing the country's immigration problems.\n\nRepublican leaders, including House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have cautioned the President against unilateral action on immigration. Senator John Barrasso compared the President's executive action on immigration to throwing a \"hand grenade\" into his negotiations with the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nThe immigration reform debate adds to the challenges Congress will face when they return this week following a wave of Republican victories in the midterm elections. Lawmakers will also grapple with budget issues, tax measures, and the confirmation of New York federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch as the next Attorney General.\n\nPresident Obama accepted responsibility for the Democrats' widespread losses in the elections, which he described as a referendum on his job performance. He acknowledged the slow but steady economic recovery, but noted that many Americans are still struggling and are frustrated by partisan gridlock in Washington.\n\nIn the lame-duck session, lawmakers will also consider the President's request of $5.6 billion to combat the Islamic State terrorist army, including $1.6 billion for a U.S. military buildup to train and equip Iraqi forces. The President emphasized that U.S. troops would not be engaging in combat operations, but would be training and supporting Iraqi and Sunni tribal forces.\n\nAs he risks a confrontation with Republican leaders over immigration, the President argued that offering legal status and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was necessary due to the country's lack of capacity to deport 11 million people. He also insisted that his executive order does not preclude Congress from passing legislation that could replace his executive action.\n\nThe President's decision to use an executive order was defended on the grounds of securing the border, a key focus of the immigration debate for Republican lawmakers. However, the President's executive orders will serve as a benchmark against any legislation passed by Congress when deciding whether to sign a bill or exercise his veto power.",
    " Title: Strategist Rick Wilson Advises GOP Silence on Clinton Email Scandal, Urges Strategic Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing Clinton email controversy, national Republican message and media strategist Rick Wilson has offered some advice to his colleagues in Congress, the conservative movement, and right-leaning opinion media: remain silent until a clear plan of action is in place. Wilson suggests that it is better to stay quiet rather than play into the Clinton's traditional tactics, which he describes as manipulating the press and relying on the opposition to mishandle their response.\n\nWilson argues that the media is eager to move past the story, as it brings to light the Clinton's 30-year history of \"slimy, predatory\" behavior and the \"venal, sleazy, one-step-ahead-of-the-law hillbilly hustle\" that has tainted their political career. He believes that the Clintons are stumbling towards political peril, with the story of Hillary Clinton's potentially illegal use of private email servers consuming the Washington and New York press corps.\n\nWilson warns that the media is waiting for Republicans to make a mistake, and that an intemperate remark from a GOP representative would be the perfect opportunity for them to shift the focus away from the Clinton email scandal. He advises his colleagues to maintain message discipline, hold focus, and keep a broader objective in mind, rather than getting caught up in daily press releases, social media hits, or email fundraising drops.\n\nWilson emphasizes the importance of having a plan, executing it with discipline, and proceeding against Clinton with a measured pace and tone. He suggests focusing on the national security risks posed by Clinton's email server, as well as the broader implications of the Clinton culture. Wilson encourages Republicans to use a bipartisan tone, reducing expectations rather than raising them, and to vary their approach to avoid being a single target for the Clintons' demonization tactics.\n\nIn conclusion, Wilson's advice to the GOP is to take a strategic approach to the Clinton email scandal, focusing on the national security risks and the broader implications of the Clinton culture, rather than getting caught up in the daily drama of the story. He encourages Republicans to be persistent, serious, and smart in their approach to the Clinton email controversy.",

However, outside the big cities, LGBTQ individuals still face widespread discrimination and violence.\n\nAnjali Siroya, a 21-year-old transgender woman from Mumbai, shared her experiences of living with her parents and brother. \"They don't beat me anymore after I tried to run away once... but being with them 24/7 is still very traumatic,\" she told AFP.\n\nAs the pressure at home has grown, Siroya has turned to Instagram to celebrate her gender identity and fight for equality. \"I miss dressing up, putting on lipstick and earrings, and posing for selfies,\" she said. \"I know this might sound silly to some people, but it was a way for me to express myself.\"\n\nLGBTQ individuals have increasingly turned to social media and online communities for support during the lockdown. Seema, a bisexual sociology student in Delhi, told AFP that life under lockdown felt \"lonely and claustrophobic.\" \"Everything I say about girls needs to be said in code,\" she said, describing how she hides her phone from her mother and grandparents to avoid being accidentally outed.\n\nIndia's LGBTQ activists have largely advised members of the community to wait until life returns to normal before coming out to their families. \"As an out and proud trans person, I would never tell another person not to live their truth,\" said Jo, digital editor for online forum Gaysi, who goes by one name. \"But right now, it is simply too dangerous to come out of the closet.\"\n\nEven those who have come out and found some acceptance have faced complications. Tina, a 25-year-old bisexual artist, told AFP that her father, who initially reacted well to her coming out, is \"not entirely comfortable\" as the lockdown wears on. \"Earlier, I didn't spend much time thinking about how my parents would respond; now every possibility has become more real,\" she said. \"I don't know how my mum will react if she knows. I don't think she will ask me to leave home, but I am not 100 percent sure.\"\n\nThe lockdown has brought misery to millions, destroying migrant workers' livelihoods and driving many deeper into poverty. For India's LGBTQ community, the restrictions have left them vulnerable to further abuse, often at the hands of their own families.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Democrats of Fault in Migrant Child Deaths at Border, as Investigation Ensues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, President Donald Trump placed the blame for the recent deaths of two migrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border on congressional Democrats, asserting that their immigration policies have encouraged foreign families to embark on the perilous journey.\n\n\"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"They can't. If we had a Wall, they wouldn't even try!\"\n\nThis week, House Democrats ordered Homeland Security officials to preserve all evidence related to the deaths of an 8-year-old boy, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, and a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, both of whom died this month after crossing the border illegally with their parents.\n\nFelipe Gomez Alonzo died on Christmas Eve, six days after he was taken into Border Patrol custody. He had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, but was readmitted hours later and died soon thereafter. His mother in Guatemala stated that the boy's father brought the child on the trip to the U.S. in the belief that gaining illegal entry would be easier with a child.\n\nEarlier this month, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died after being arrested for crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents managed to revive her twice after she fell ill, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital.\n\nPresident Trump contended that the two children \"were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol.\" He also tweeted, \"The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn't given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!\"\n\nThe investigation into the circumstances surrounding the children's deaths is set to begin next month.",
    " Title: Unlikely Friendship: Christie and Clinton Share the Spotlight at Clinton Global Initiative Event\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, is headlining the closing ceremonies of Bill Clinton's annual international forum in Chicago. The event, titled \"Cooperation and Collaboration: A Conversation on Leadership,\" is a product of an unlikely friendship that has developed between the former president and the governor over the past four years.\n\nSources close to both Clinton and Christie revealed that this friendship has its roots in the 2009 election, when Clinton campaigned against Christie, who was then the incumbent governor. Despite Clinton's efforts to end Christie's political career, the two have since developed a bond, with Clinton admiring Christie's political acumen and straightforward style.\n\nThe unpredictable Christie was a key fundraiser and campaigner for Mitt Romney, Obama's GOP challenger in the 2012 election. In return, Christie got to deliver the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. However, their relationship took a new turn after Superstorm Sandy devastated the Jersey Shore. In the aftermath, Christie sought federal aid and established a bipartisan working relationship with Obama, which angered some GOP stalwarts.\n\nNow, as Christie faces re-election and is touted as a possible contender for Clinton's old office on Pennsylvania Avenue, Christie is sharing the spotlight with him, a man who was once a thorn in Christie's political side.\n\nRepresentatives of both men declined to comment for this story, saying Clinton and Christie will say what needs to be said when they take the stage at today's Clinton Global Initiative event. Insiders say the real story behind today's event is the private friendship that has developed between the ex-president and the governor who aspires to be president.\n\nThe two have met, traded war stories, and talked on the phone, all within the past four years. People familiar with the private conversations between the governor and the former president said this is the second time Clinton invited Christie to play a starring role at the Clinton Global Initiative in Chicago. Christie had been tentatively scheduled to attend last year but was scrubbed from the final agenda.\n\nIn other words, this \"bromance,\" they said, has been going on longer than Christie's new, high-profile attachment to the latest inhabitant of the White House, Obama. Insiders say the unlikely pairing of Clinton and Christie started with Clinton taking note of Christie's political acumen even as the ex-president was working against Christie.\n\nAt the time, Clinton was campaigning hard for then-Gov. Jon Corzine, the incumbent Christie beat in 2009. As he worked crowds across the Garden State, Clinton painted Christie as hostile toward women, the middle class, and working people while openly questioning \"why are we having an election?\"\n\nClinton, 66, insisted that the poor economy was making people think ill of Corzine, and that he needed to travel New Jersey because \"It matters what the governors do, it matters what the states do,\" so voters needed to send Corzine back to Trenton.\n\nDespite the speeches, Clinton had started noticing Christie's tough talk and skill at sparring with reporters, sources said. Soon afterward, Christie again impressed the always-a-politician Clinton as the rookie governor battled New Jersey's powerful teachers unions.\n\nSo, later in 2010, when the two wound up a few rows apart at the Big East basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden, Clinton had his people arrange for a quick chat with Christie. That led to a summit of sorts at Clinton's post-presidential office in Harlem, where Clinton and Christie talked politics and public policy.\n\n\"It was very good, long Clintonesque conversation,\" one Clinton person said.\n\nWhat was clear during that meeting and the subsequent opportunities for the two pols to talk is how much alike Clinton and Christie are.\n\n\"Christie is like Clinton,\" the insider said. \"You couldn't be in a room with Chris Christie and not come away thinking, 'Christie is a neat guy to be around. He's normal. He grabs a room. Like Clinton.' \"\n\nNever a darling of the Republican right-wing, Christie and his aides are well aware that a trip to the Clinton conference is more than just a pleasant diversion to Chicago. It can, in fact, provide potential opponents with more ammunition to demonstrate how disloyal Christie is to the conservative electorate that turns out in presidential primaries.\n\nFor a governor who constantly reminds people he can work with leaders of all stripes, the appearance today and the friendship with Clinton are worth the political risks.\n\n\"This is a stature thing,\" a Christie source said. \"It burnishes his [Christie's] bipartisan credentials and it shows the governor is a serious guy.

    " Title: Supreme Court's Religious Freedom Cases: A Shift in Trend or Temporary Setback?\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court's defense of religious freedom may be experiencing a shift in trend, as indicated by a series of cases over the past year that prioritize preventing discrimination over protecting religion. This change was highlighted by Justice Samuel Alito in an obscure order issued on the last day of the recent term, where the court refused to consider a family-owned pharmacy's objection to a Washington state regulation forcing it to stock and sell emergency contraceptives.\n\nIn his dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, Alito warned that the court's decision could send an \"ominous sign\" for religious liberty. \"If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern,\" Alito said.\n\nThis perceived left turn by the court, which has historically carved out protections for religious groups and individuals, could potentially impact an upcoming case involving a Missouri church's effort to qualify for state playground funds and another challenge to the pharmacy rule.\n\nUnder the leadership of Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts, the court has previously ruled in favor of religious groups and individuals in cases such as a Missouri church's exemption from employment discrimination laws, private corporations' avoidance of federal health regulations regarding contraceptives, and a New York town's opening of meetings with Christian prayers.\n\nLast year, the court ruled in favor of a Muslim prisoner who sought to wear a beard, a Muslim woman denied a job because she wore a headscarf, and a tiny Arizona church that protested municipal restrictions on street signs. However, the court did not side with religious non-profits or the government in similar cases this year, instead sending them back for further appellate review.\n\nThe case in question, brought by the Stormans family, who operate Ralph's Thriftway in Olympia, Washington, was considered a strong case by conservatives against a unique state regulation that pharmacies must fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including morning-after pills that prevent a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus.\n\nKristen Waggoner, who represented the pharmacy through a federal district court victory and an appeals court defeat, is cautious about assuming the court has shifted on religious freedom cases. However, she expresses concern about the court's decision not to hear the Stormans case. \"We're seeing the red flags,\" Waggoner says. \"The risk is Americans will no longer have the right to live consistent with their faith without punishment from the government.\"\n\nSome defenders of religious freedom do not share Alito's fear for the future. Eric Rassbach, deputy general counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, states, \"The court has been responsive to religious liberty claims in most of the cases in recent years. I don't see a reason to think that the court is going to become deaf to religious claims.\"\n\nDouglas Laycock, a religious liberty expert at the University of Virginia School of Law, agrees that the risk arises when core issues important to liberals are at stake, such as women's access to all methods of birth control. \"The liberal justices are willing to protect religious liberty when their more favored issues are not at stake, or perhaps when the case is clear enough,\" Laycock says.\n\nHowever, when other interests such as preventing discrimination against women, gays and lesbians, or minorities are involved, the court's recent responses please liberal groups. \"Religious liberty doesn't give you a right to impose your views on others,\" says Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union. She sees the court's recent actions as \"part of a broader move to advance equality.\"\n\nMany conservatives are wary that the court, stripped of the influence and vote of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and often controlled by the more mercurial Justice Anthony Kennedy, may increasingly favor government regulators over religious believers. \"What we're seeing is a sort of shift around social norms concerning sexuality,\" says Jay Richards, assistant research professor at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. \"Kennedy is the best Geiger counter. He's a very good instrument for measuring that.\"\n\nThe next test will come in the fall, when the justices consider a Missouri church's challenge to being denied state funds for playground resurfacing. A second case involving the pharmacy regulations also could be headed their way in the future, along with lawsuits from merchants who refuse to participate in same-sex weddings. \"There's more and more of these cases coming up,\" Waggoner says. \"This is not over.\"",
    " Title: Russia Imposes Import Ban on Food Products from Western Countries in Response to Sanctions\n\nArticle:\n\nRussia has announced a ban on the import of meat, fish, milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway. The ban, which lasts for one year, was announced by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday, in response to sanctions imposed by the West over the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to impose the import ban was made on orders from President Vladimir Putin, demonstrating Putin's unwillingness to bow to Western pressure over Ukraine and his intention to retaliate against the West. The ban is part of a series of measures taken by the Kremlin in response to the sanctions, which have targeted entire sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nMedvedev also announced that Russia is considering banning Western carriers from flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia, a move that would significantly increase costs and flight time. He said the decision on this matter has not been made yet.\n\nIn addition to the food import ban, Russia may also introduce restrictions regarding imports of planes, navy vessels, and cars, Medvedev said. However, he added that the government will realistically assess its own production potential before making any decisions.\n\nThe move follows the latest round of sanctions against Russia imposed by the EU last week, which targeted entire sectors of the Russian economy for the first time. The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency, and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies.\n\nMedvedev argued that the ban would give Russian farmers, who have struggled to compete with Western products, a good chance to increase their market share. However, experts have said that local producers will find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector has continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds.\n\nWhile the government claimed it will move quickly to replace Western imports by importing more food from Latin America, Turkey, and ex-Soviet nations to avoid empty shelves and price hikes, analysts predicted that it will further speed up inflation. Russia depends heavily on imported foodstuffs, particularly in the largest and most prosperous cities such as Moscow, where imported food fills an estimated 60-70 percent of the market. Food and agricultural imports from the U.S. amounted to $1.3 billion last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and in 2013 the EU's agricultural exports to Russia totaled 11.8 billion euros ($15.8 billion).\n\nMedvedev made it clear that Russia hopes that the sanctions will make the West revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions. \"Until the last moment we hoped that our partners would understand that sanctions only lead to a deadlock, and no one needs them,\" he said. \"We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us.\"",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Address to Congress: A Critique of Conservative Policies and a Call for the Common Good\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis' address to the U.S. Congress on Thursday was a clear critique of conservative policies, particularly those of the Republican Party. The pontiff's speech, which was not expected to be political or partisan, leaned towards the liberal side, causing discomfort among conservative Republicans.\n\nFive key moments in Francis' speech that made conservatives squirm included:\n\n1. The shout-out to Dorothy Day: Francis commended four Americans in particular, whom he held up as examples of pursuing the common good. Among them was Dorothy Day, a radical social activist who founded the Catholic Worker Movement during the Great Depression. Day was a socialist, outspoken in her support of pacifism and labor rights.\n\n2. The abortion switcheroo: In defiance of the specific guidance not to score political points, congressional conservatives leapt to their feet when Francis mentioned the Vatican's standard coded language about abortion. However, they were taken aback when he immediately followed that with a call for the global abolition of the death penalty.\n\n3. Catholic social teaching on the death penalty: Francis' call for the abolition of the death penalty is in line with the Catholic Church's long-standing position that opposes the death penalty and nuclear war, most famously with Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bernardin's \"seamless garment\" doctrine.\n\n4. Calling arms deals \"money drenched in blood\": Francis questioned who is selling weapons to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society, and called out the shameful and culpable silence of those involved in the arms trade.\n\n5. Reminding the GOP we're all foreigners: Francis, as the son of immigrants, reminded those who are making intolerance toward immigrants their political stock-in-trade that they, like him, are likely the descendants of immigrant families.\n\nIn addition, Francis' call for politicians to work for the common good was an implicit rebuke to the do-nothing, obstructionist GOP agenda that he sees as being in service to their corporatist, Chamber of Commerce overlords.\n\nIn one of the most moving passages of his speech, Francis said, \"Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves.\"\n\nFrancis also confronted conservative critics of his climate change encyclical \"Laudato si,\" rebuking those who claim that he is anti-commerce and wants to stifle development or reduce the world to subsistence-level farming to stop climate change. Instead, he emphasized the importance of the right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise in an economy that seeks to be modern, inclusive, and sustainable.\n\nOverall, Francis' address to Congress was a call for a more compassionate, inclusive, and sustainable future, and a clear critique of the conservative policies that run counter to Catholic social teaching.",
    " Title: El Chapo's Escape: A Mile-Long Tunnel and a Calculated Escape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a daring escape reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Mexico's most notorious drug kingpin, slipped through a hidden tunnel from his prison cell, evading surveillance cameras and electronic monitoring devices. The dramatic escape was revealed in a closed-circuit video that shows Guzman calmly and easily executing his plan.\n\nAccording to Mexican Interior Minister Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, Guzman's cell was under 24-hour surveillance, but the system had two blind spots for privacy - the toilet and the shower. It was in the shower that Guzman, nicknamed \"Shorty\" for his height, managed to escape.\n\nGuzman not only evaded the cameras but also sidestepped another security measure with surprising ease. He had a bracelet that monitored his every move, but he left it behind before he crawled into the tunnel.\n\nAuthorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border are now searching for signs of the fugitive drug lord. The manhunt is a challenging task, according to a top Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official. \"The cartel headed by Chapo is probably the most well-financed, vicious, criminal entity we have ever seen, with unlimited resources both to bribe, corrupt and to transport,\" said DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley.\n\nBoth the United States and Mexico are exchanging intelligence, including details from informants, in the manhunt, and the United States is providing technical support. Reports claiming authorities from the two countries are not working together are not true, Riley said.\n\nMexican authorities have released a recent photograph of Guzman, showing him with a shaved head and face, but without his trademark mustache. The photograph was taken during his escape, officials believe.\n\nThe tunnel Guzman used during his escape was a sophisticated one, complete with lighting, ventilation, and a modified motorcycle on tracks. The tunnel began with a 50-by-50-centimeter (20-by-20-inch) opening inside the shower of Guzman's cell and ended inside a half-built house.\n\nIt is believed that the Sinaloa cartel had spent years infiltrating the country's prison system. Whoever helped in the plot likely had the architectural plans for the prison that pointed them toward the shower area.\n\nGuzman's escape is not the first time he has pulled off an elaborate escape. In 2001, he managed to break free while reportedly hiding in a laundry cart. It took authorities 13 years to catch him - closing in as he was sleeping at a Mexican beach resort.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel, led by Guzman, moves drugs by land, air, and sea, including cargo aircraft, private aircraft, buses, fishing vessels, and even submarines. The cartel has become so powerful that Forbes magazine listed Guzman in its 2009 list of \"self-made\" billionaires. Guzman's estimated fortune at the time was $1 billion.\n\nGuzman has been a nightmare for both sides of the border. He reigns over a multibillion-dollar global drug empire that supplied much of the marijuana, cocaine, and heroin sold on the streets of the United States. Chicago has labeled him the city's \"Public Enemy No. 1.\"\n\nDEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley, who spent years fighting Guzman's cartel, expressed his personal anger over the escape. \"I spent nearly five years fighting what he was doing to the city, what he was doing to the communities by bringing heroin in and working a business relationship with street gangs,\" he said. \"For me, personally, it was a milestone to see him in jail. And when I got the call at 2:30 in the morning last Saturday, I about passed out.\"\n\nBut no matter what it takes, investigators will find a way to capture him, Riley said. \"I am sure his security is probably second to none in the country. But that's not going to deter us. It did not deter us the first time,\" he said. \"This guy is going to be back in jail.\"",
    " Title: Senator Ted Cruz Introduces Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the ISIS attacks in Paris, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has introduced a bill aimed at preventing potential terrorist infiltration through refugee admissions. The bill, titled the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act of 2015, seeks to temporarily bar refugees from countries with significant terrorist presence, particularly those controlled in substantial part by ISIS, al Qaeda, or other designated foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nThe bill, which Cruz introduced as a presidential candidate, names Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen as countries from which refugees would be barred. It empowers the State Department to identify and designate additional countries as potential sources of terror. The bill is intended to be a temporary measure, sunsetting after three years, allowing for reevaluation and adjustments or expiration.\n\nCruz, an unapologetic proponent of legal immigration, emphasizes that the bill would not prevent the United States from providing humanitarian aid consistent with national security. The bill allows for a narrow exception in cases of genocide victims, such as the Yazidis and certain Christian sects, but only in the severest cases of persecution and with a high bar of proof.\n\nCruz argues that the bill is a necessary step to protect the American people from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat he believes the Obama Administration has been reluctant to acknowledge. He contends that the bill is a small, first step toward protecting America, and he will not apologize for defending the nation.\n\nThe bill comes amidst growing concerns about the potential for ISIS to infiltrate the flood of refugees entering Europe and the United States. The Obama Administration has faced criticism for its open-borders policies, particularly in light of FBI Director James Comey's testimony to Congress that the government lacks the tools to properly screen these refugees.\n\nThe bill's introduction follows the Paris attacks, in which ISIS claimed responsibility for the coordinated assault on multiple locations, resulting in over 130 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The attacks have sparked a global outpouring of sympathy and calls for increased security measures.",
    " Title: Kentucky Protestors Hang Effigy of Governor Beshear, Sparking Bipartisan Condemnation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented turn of events, protestors in Kentucky hung an effigy of Democratic Governor Andy Beshear outside the state capitol during a demonstration on Sunday. The protest, organized by Take Back Kentucky, was initially intended as a celebration of freedom and a fight against what they perceive as unconstitutional shutdown measures due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe rally, which attracted around 100 people, began with a focus on the Second Amendment but soon shifted to a call against coronavirus restrictions. The protestors marched to the governor's house, shouting \"Come out Andy,\" according to videos posted on Twitter. They later returned to the state capitol, where several people participated in hanging the effigy from a tree, as reported by the Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd.\n\nThe effigy bore a picture of Beshear's face and a message that read \"sic temper tyrannis,\" a Latin phrase that translates to \"thus always to tyrants.\" The effigy was promptly removed, according to the Courier Journal.\n\nThe protestors' actions have sparked swift backlash from members of both parties. Senate Majority Leader and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell condemned the effigy in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday evening. McConnell, a strong defender of the First Amendment, stated that while he supports peaceful protest, the actions demonstrated at the protest went too far.\n\nSenator McConnell tweeted, \"@SenateMajLdr: \"As a strong defender of the First Amendment, I believe Americans have the right to peacefully protest. However, today\u2019s action toward Governor Beshear is unacceptable. There is no place for hate in Kentucky.\"\n\nRepublican Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Michael G. Adams, also condemned the effigy hanging, tweeting, \"This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly. The words of John Wilkes Booth have no place in the Party of Lincoln.\"\n\nMany others, including Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Kentucky House Democrats, have also condemned the effigy hanging. In a tweet, Mayor Fischer stated, \"On Memorial Day weekend, as we honor those who gave their lives for our country, & think of the small sacrifices we make to protect our community from a pandemic, we must condemn this vile act. When we share science, keep each other healthy & safe, freedom will follow.\"\n\nKentucky House Democrats issued a lengthy statement against the effigy, calling it \"beyond reprehensible.\" The statement also expressed concern about the potential for such actions to incite violence and undermine the democratic process.",
    " Title: Joe Biden Campaign Avoids Unscripted Interviews Amid Controversial Remarks and Media Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, media reporter Joe Concha of The Hill has criticized the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, for being shielded from challenging questions by the media, particularly in the context of race relations. Concha, appearing on \"Fox & Friends,\" stated that Biden's interview with urban hip-hop host Charlamagne Tha God on \"The Breakfast Club\" did not go well, and his campaign staff is now attempting to prevent such occurrences.\n\nThe controversy arose from Biden's comments during the \"The Breakfast Club\" interview last month, where he stated, \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\" Biden later walked back the remarks, saying, \"I shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\"\n\nConcha noted that Biden has not held a press conference in 77 days, and his campaign is reportedly aiming to present a \"scripted or homogenized Biden\" to the American public. Concha argued that the campaign wants to avoid the \"extemporaneous Joe Biden\" because he tends to make controversial statements in unscripted situations.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest Fox News Poll shows Biden leading President Donald Trump in the race for the White House. The poll indicates that majorities view racism, unemployment, and coronavirus as major threats to the country's stability.\n\nInterestingly, Biden supporters are more likely to cite fear of a Trump victory as their motivation for voting (63%) compared to enthusiasm for Biden (31%). Conversely, Trump supporters are more likely to express enthusiasm for the incumbent (62%) than fear of a Biden presidency (33%).\n\nThis development underscores the ongoing tension between the Biden campaign's desire for a controlled narrative and the media's role in holding candidates accountable for their words and actions. The controversy also highlights the importance of race relations in the upcoming presidential election.",
    " Title: Facebook Takes Steps to Combat Deepfakes Ahead of Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the presidential election, Facebook has announced new measures to combat deepfakes, manipulated videos created using artificial intelligence to deceive users. The social media giant will ban videos that are \"edited or synthesized\" to mislead users but will allow parody and satire.\n\nThe move comes as concerns grow that deepfakes could be used to mislead voters, similar to the way fabricated news stories influenced public opinion in 2016. Deepfakes are videos doctored using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to distort reality.\n\nFacebook and other tech companies are sponsoring a \"Deepfake Detection Challenge\" to encourage AI researchers to develop new ways to automatically detect doctored videos. However, critics argue that Facebook's new policy is too narrow, as it does not prohibit videos using lower-tech methods of spreading disinformation, such as last year's video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that was edited to make it seem as though she was slurring her speech.\n\nDigitally manipulated video is dangerous because we tend to have faith in what we see. \"It's a real problem, and it's something that is advancing really quickly,\" says Hao Li, associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. \"Regulators and lawmakers are not catching up with this kind of technology.\"\n\nRachel Thomas, director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco, expects \"cheap fakes\" and more sophisticated deepfakes to proliferate ahead of the presidential election as part of shadowy campaigns to sway public opinion.\n\nWhen used to target elected officials or political candidates, doctored video can erode trust. Nearly two-thirds of Americans recently surveyed by Pew Research said altered images and videos caused a great deal of confusion in understanding the basic facts of current events.\n\nTo detect deepfakes, experts recommend psychological preparedness, being constantly on the alert for videos, images, and audio that have been altered. Examine the video carefully before sharing it on social media. Look for signs such as low-resolution or grainy videos, single people talking, strange or inconsistent lighting, and sound not synced with the images.\n\nHowever, as deepfake technology improves, relying on the human eye to detect manipulated content may not be enough. \"There is not a 100% foolproof way of identifying deepfakes, not even for AI researchers,\" says Thomas. \"Detection is always going to be an arms race. As people develop more accurate detection algorithms, fakers will develop even more sophisticated frauds.\"\n\nWhen in doubt, turn to nonpartisan fact-checkers who've spent hours, sometimes days, tracking down accurate information. \"You never want to jump to a conclusion one way or another,\" says computer science professor Hany Farid. \"The best you can really hope to do is to say: You know what? I should be careful here because I'm not sure, and then research it.\"\n\nLi says his company, Pinscreen, will demonstrate for attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos how to livestream fake video. He says it's part of an effort to raise awareness of the need for technologies that root out deepfakes. \"In real-time, you can reenact yourself as Will Smith or some celebrity or a politician,\" he says. \"The results are very convincing.\"",
    " Title: Disillusionment Among Trump's Nationalist Base as President Announces Afghanistan Troop Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's \"America First\" base expressed disappointment following Trump's speech on Afghanistan Monday night, as the President announced an increase in troops in the 16-year-long war. The speech, which marked a departure from the President's campaign promises to limit American intervention abroad and focus on nation-building at home, was seen by many as a return to the status quo that Americans had voted against in November.\n\nConservative commentator Ann Coulter, a former enthusiastic supporter of Trump, summed up the weariness of the nationalist right with her tweet: \"It doesn't matter who you vote for. The military-industrial complex wins. The only difference: GOP presidents pronounce 'Pakistan' correctly.\"\n\nEven Trump himself admitted to a flip-flop in his foreign policy, stating in the address that his original instinct was to pull out of the country, but that he had been convinced otherwise.\n\nOn Fox News, which has traditionally been supportive of military interventions, the reaction was mixed. While on-air, the reception was broadly positive, other commentators weren't convinced. Fox News Radio's Todd Starnes accused the President of changing his campaign promise from \"America First\" to \"Afghanistan First.\"\n\nOther right-wingers also reacted negatively to the speech, noting the stark contrast between Trump's new plan and his rhetoric on the campaign trail. Kyle Feldscher, a conservative commentator, tweeted: \"This sounds like every speech by an American president on Afghanistan since 2001.\"\n\nRadio host Stefan Molyneux contrasted Trump's speech with statements he had made on Twitter on Afghanistan before. Filmmaker and author Mike Cernovich sarcastically offered his congratulations to \"President McMaster\" and \"General Jared,\" referring to Trump's national security adviser and senior adviser respectively.\n\nEven moderate conservatives struggled to drum up enthusiasm for Trump's policy, with right-leaning Washington Post reporter Robert Costa giving a lukewarm reception to the plan. Costa noted the contrast between some of the rhetoric from Trump, and the plan itself, tweeting: \"Trump is echoing many of the points Bannon made behind the scenes.

    " Title: Trump's Immigration Stance Remains Unclear as Campaign Muddies Position Ahead of Arizona Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the general election approaches, the position of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on immigration remains unclear, with contradictory statements from the candidate and his campaign team. The lack of clarity has left policy experts and the public questioning the candidate's stance, with some suggesting that Trump is deliberately sowing confusion to allow voters to pick and choose which statements to believe.\n\nA year ago, Trump's stated position on immigration was to deport all undocumented immigrants and their family members, including those who were U.S. citizens by birth. This hardline stance helped Trump gain support in the Republican primary, but with the general election just two months away, the candidate has softened his rhetoric, suggesting a \"touch back\" policy and expressing openness to \"softening\" on immigration while still being \"aggressive\" in the application of deportation laws.\n\nHowever, Trump's campaign manager has ruled out the \"touch back\" policy, and the candidate has since reversed himself, suggesting that he is \"hardening\" his stance. This inconsistency has left policy experts unconvinced that Trump is moderating, with some calling for clarity on the candidate's immigration policies.\n\n\"We haven't really seen much change at all,\" said Jacinta Ma of the National Immigration Forum Action Fund. \"We would really like [Trump] to be more clear about the immigration policies that he's talking about.\"\n\nWith Trump's big immigration speech in Arizona set for later this week, Ma said, \"The expectation should be that, as president, he should be able to articulate the policies in a clear manner so that we understand what... he wants to do in terms of the direction of the country as it relates to immigration policy.\"\n\nOther experts are skeptical that such clarity is even possible at this point, given how deeply Trump has dug himself into the anti-immigrant hole. \"A lot of what [Trump] is saying is either completely wrong or completely contradictory,\" said Ben Johnson of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"I don't see a way out for him on this issue unless he makes a really significant, clear change in [his] policy position because so much of the language he's been using so far has just been unworkable and broadly opposed by the majority of the American people.\"\n\nTrump's supporters, however, may be more forgiving of the candidate's inconsistencies, with many focusing on the issue of building a wall along the southern border. While some may sympathize with undocumented immigrants who are already in the country and leading productive lives, the wall remains a key issue for many Trump supporters.\n\nHowever, even if Trump moderates his views on immigration, it may be too late to make a difference, as he has been running as an anti-immigrant, \"law and order\" candidate for 14 months. With his big immigration speech in Arizona set for later this week, the expectation is that Trump will provide some clarity on his position, but it remains to be seen whether he will be able to do so in a way that satisfies both his supporters and the general electorate.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Threatens to Ignore Senate Bills in Response to Filibuster Rule Change Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of the ongoing partisan dispute between Democrats and Republicans, House Speaker John Boehner has joined Senate Republicans in their efforts to prevent Democrats from limiting filibusters. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has threatened to disregard bills sent by the Senate if Democrats are found to have abused the rights of GOP senators to delay legislation.\n\nThis move by Boehner marks an unusual escalation of a bitter partisan fight that has been brewing in the Senate for weeks. The threat underscores a Republican strategy to retain as much power as possible in the upcoming year, when Democrats will control the White House and Senate, while Republicans will lead only the House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has indicated that on the first day of the new Congress in January, he may use a simple majority vote to alter filibuster rules. This step, which usually requires a two-thirds vote to change Senate rules, would allow Democrats to amend the filibuster rules without GOP support, a move that has infuriated Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, and other Republicans. Democrats will control the new Senate 55-45, including one Democratic-leaning independent.\n\nBoehner described Reid's threat as \"clearly designed to marginalize Senate Republicans and their constituents while greasing the skids for controversial, partisan measures.\" He added, \"Any bill that reaches a Republican-led House based on Senate Democrats' heavy-handed power play would be dead on arrival.\"\n\nThe proposed rules change would not take effect until next year, but Boehner suggested that it could poison the atmosphere even sooner, \"at a time when cooperation on Capitol Hill is critical.\"\n\nCurrently, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders of both parties are engaged in negotiations over deficit-cutting measures aimed at avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff of big tax increases and deep spending cuts scheduled to begin in January unless lawmakers find a way to avert them.\n\nMinority parties in the Senate use filibusters\u2014parliamentary delays\u2014to slow or kill legislation. They can only be ended by 60 votes, a margin neither party can achieve without some cooperation from the other side. Democrats argue that Republicans are abusing filibusters by resorting to them too frequently, and statistics show that minority Republicans have increasingly used the tactic in recent years. Reid's plan would forbid the use of filibusters when a bill is initially being brought to the Senate floor for debate and require filibustering senators to actually be on the Senate floor, a long-abandoned practice.\n\nIn response to Boehner's threat, Reid's spokesman, Adam Jentleson, stated, \"It is a shame to see Speaker Boehner join Sen. McConnell's desperate attempt to double down in the status quo of Republican-led gridlock in Washington.\"\n\nRepublicans argue that they have used filibusters more because Democrats block them from presenting amendments. In turn, Democrats claim that Republicans use too much time pushing amendments that make political statements or are designed to derail bills.\n\nThe battle has prompted numerous sharp exchanges on the Senate floor in recent days between Reid and McConnell. Neither side has ruled out negotiating a solution to the dispute.",
    " Title: Trump's Mandate for Obamacare Repeal: A Look at the Post-Election Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, many, including this author, were taken aback by Donald Trump's victory, having underestimated his electoral prospects. However, the unexpected outcome has spared the nation four years of Clintonian corruption and scandal while providing a genuine mandate for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nAccording to the first major post-election voter survey, \"Seventy-four percent of Republicans say they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act when Donald Trump takes the White House.\" This desire to repeal Obamacare is not limited to the Republican party. Recent public opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans want to be rid of it. In late October, Gallup reported, \"When asked about repealing 'Obamacare,' 51% said they favor repealing it.\" A week before the election, Rasmussen reported, \"Voters overwhelmingly favor changes in Obamacare, with more voters than ever calling for its outright repeal.\"\n\nPredictably, the legacy media have embarked upon a propaganda campaign designed to convince the public that the law is essentially impervious to repeal. The Washington Post portentously warns, \"Donald Trump is about to face a rude awakening over Obamacare.\" One Los Angeles Times headline declares, \"Despite Republican pledges,'repealing Obamacare' will be almost impossible.\" My favorite is this howler from Politico, \"Obamacare defenders vow 'total war.'\" The editors of these and many other establishment publications are like those Japanese soldiers who periodically emerge from Pacific island caves, refusing to believe that World War II is over and that their side lost.\n\nYou know the media is shell-shocked when the most sensible piece about the party charged with defending Obamacare was produced by Matthew Yglesias at Vox under the headline, \"The whole Democratic Party is now a smoking pile of rubble.\" Most of Obamacare's dead-enders in the media and elsewhere assume that it can't be repealed because the GOP doesn't have a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes in the Senate. But, in 2018, at least 6 of the 48 Democrat Senators who will retain their seats after January must face reelection in red states where the voters will not reward them for obstructing repeal. These vulnerable Democrats may well be willing to cooperate with the Republicans in breaking a filibuster.\n\nEven if these red state Democrats remain intransigent, the worst elements of Obamacare can be repealed by sidestepping a filibuster. The GOP leadership can utilize the same budget maneuver, reconciliation, which permitted them to slap H.R.3762 on the President's desk last January. That bill wouldn't have repealed every line of the law, but it would have eliminated the individual and employer mandates, many of its taxes, and phased out its subsidies. Obama vetoed the bill, of course. However, as Paul Ryan said at the time, \"We have shown now that there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate. So, next year, if we're sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law.\"\n\nWell, next January, we will have a Republican President, and he has signaled that he will sign a bill like H.R.3762 that leaves some parts of Obamacare in place. Perversely, the very media outlets that denounced Trump for pledging to repeal Obamacare now accuse him of \"waffling.\" Misrepresenting an interview with the Wall Street Journal, outlets like NBC have produced headlines like, \"Repeal Obamacare? Maybe Not, Says Trump.\" Hilariously, this fictitious change of heart is being attributed to last week's meeting with the President: \"After meeting with President Obama, Trump hinted that he is willing to keep the pre-existing conditions portion.\" As it happens, Trump has always supported that provision of the law.\n\nConspicuously absent from all of this nonsense is any discussion of which provisions of the President's \"signature domestic achievement\" are supported by the 60.3 million voters who cast their ballots for Trump, the majority of people living in all those red states that cover most of the electoral map. The answer to that question, oddly enough, appears to be of little interest to the media, the anti-Trump rioters, or the thumb-suckers of the Snowflake Rebellion. Nonetheless, last Tuesday's exit polls have a story to tell about Obamacare for anyone willing to listen: \"Voters feeling that the law went too far are breaking decisively for Trump, 80 percent to 13 percent.\" In flyover country, we call this a mandate.",
    " Title: White House and GOP Diverge on Minimum Wage and Healthcare Reform Agendas Ahead of Election Year\n\nArticle:\n\nSaturday marked a clear distinction in the approaches of President Obama and the Republican Party as they gear up for the crucial election year. While the White House is focusing on economic and income-equality issues, the GOP remains centered on the Affordable Care Act and its impact across the nation.\n\nIn his weekly address, President Obama reiterated his call for a minimum wage increase from the current $7.25 to $10.10 for all Americans. He highlighted his recent executive action to implement this pay raise for federal contractors. However, in this week's GOP address, Representative Tom Rooney of Florida did not mention the president's minimum wage push or related issues. Instead, he focused solely on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe minimum wage increase for all Americans is a significant part of what Mr. Obama has termed the \"opportunity agenda.\" Unlike other aspects of this agenda, the minimum wage increase requires congressional approval.\n\n\"Raising the minimum wage wouldn't just raise their wages; its effect would lift wages for about 28 million Americans,\" the president said. \"It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty and help millions more work their way out of poverty without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending.\"\n\nPresident Obama, along with fellow Democrats, aims to make the minimum wage and the broader issue of income inequality a top issue leading into the fall. On the other hand, Republicans are counting on the continued emergence of Affordable Care Act-related issues, which they believe will help increase their majority in the House and potentially capture the Senate.\n\nRepresentative Rooney shared several stories of constituents facing difficulties due to the Affordable Care Act, including difficulties in seeing primary care physicians and specialists. He accused the Affordable Care Act of breaking promises made to working families and seniors.\n\n\"We must work together to repeal this law,\" Mr. Rooney said, acknowledging the numerous past failures to repeal the law. The Republican Party has attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 40 times in the past.",
    " Title: Obama's Nominees Face Obstruction from Republicans, Testing the Senate's Constitutional Obligations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of political standoffs, President Barack Obama's nominees for key positions, including the Secretary of Labor, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, and the National Labor Relations Board, are facing obstruction from the Republican party. This ongoing resistance, as reported by the author, is not just about filling these positions, but rather, it is a test of the United States Senate's constitutional duty to provide advice and consent.\n\nThe Senate's decision on these nominations could potentially be made in July. If the Republicans continue to block \"yes\" or \"no\" votes on Obama's executive and judicial nominees, the majority may be forced to revisit Senate rules to put an end to the Republican efforts to subvert the Senate's constitutional obligation.\n\nThe resistance is particularly evident in the case of Richard Cordray, Obama's nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB was established as part of the Wall Street reform law to protect consumers of financial products. In a clear attempt to protect special interests that contributed to the economic collapse, Republicans have so far refused to confirm Cordray. In fact, they have stated they will not confirm anyone to run the CFPB, aiming to render the agency ineffective as intended by law.\n\nThe Republican obstinacy is equally apparent in the president's nominees for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the independent agency responsible for protecting workers' rights. A hearing on these nominees this month showed no signs of a thaw in the Republican resistance. As a result, Cordray and some current NLRB members had to be appointed through recess appointments.\n\nA recent decision by three Republican-appointed judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has further complicated matters. This decision, which goes against decades of precedent, argues that the president does not have the power to make recess appointments. This decision is part of a pattern in which the D.C. Circuit has blocked Wall Street reforms, undermined labor rights, and rolled back environmental protections.\n\nUntil recently, there were four vacancies on the 11-member court. Though Republicans allowed one of these vacancies to be filled last month, they are trying to prevent the president from filling the remaining three and restoring balance to the D.C. Circuit. Republicans are aware that when senior judges, who handle a reduced caseload, are counted, this court still is dominated by Republican appointees. In a desperate attempt to maintain this imbalance, the latest tactic from Republican senators involves a 'pre-emptive filibuster'\u2014an effort to eliminate the three remaining vacant judgeships on the court to prevent Obama from exercising his constitutional obligation.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accelerates Appointment Process, Deploys \"Landing Parties\" to Federal Agencies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has stepped up its efforts this week, deploying \"landing parties\" to federal agencies responsible for national security and reportedly offering the first major appointment of the new administration. This acceleration in activity marks a significant shift in the transition process, which has been criticized for its slow pace in the first week following the election.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, citing an anonymous senior Trump official, Trump has offered the post of White House national security adviser to retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency chief. It remains unclear whether Gen. Flynn, an early supporter of Trump and a speaker at the Republican National Convention, has accepted the offer.\n\nTrump held numerous interviews at Trump Tower in New York with potential Cabinet members and advisers, and met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill.\n\nFollowing a \"very candid\" meeting with Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister expressed his confidence in Trump, stating, \"I will be able to establish a relationship of trust.\" Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump face-to-face since his election victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, the landing-party members huddled in conference rooms at the agencies, receiving thick binders and detailed presentations that included organization charts, budget forecasts, and parking space assignments, according to veterans of previous transitions.\n\nDouglas Brook, who worked on outgoing transition teams for Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, noted that both sides typically are professionals who \"speak the same language\" in their fields of expertise, regardless of policy differences. However, he emphasized that a concerted effort is required to achieve a smooth handover, as accomplished by the Bush-Obama teams.\n\nThe transition team's timetable has been emphasized due to repeated news reports about slow progress and turmoil, which Trump transition officials dispute. Trump's pace in filling his Cabinet is not significantly behind that of most recent presidents. When Barack Obama was putting together his first administration in 2008, he did not make his first Cabinet appointment until three weeks after the election.\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser David Axelrod tweeted, \"Lots of reasons to be concerned about @realDonaldTrump transition but the pace of the announcements isn't one of them. That's not a fair shot.\"\n\nTrump's landing parties will tackle federal agencies in three waves: national security, economic, and domestic. The next wave will focus on the Treasury, Commerce Department, U.S. Trade Representative's office, Small Business Administration, and Social Security Administration. The final team will address domestic agencies, including the departments of Interior, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Energy, Labor, Transportation, Education, and Health and Human Services, as well as independent agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget, Federal Trade Commission, and NASA.\n\nTrump's meeting schedule in New York on Thursday included diplomatic legend Henry Kissinger, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, and Family Research Council leader Ken Blackwell. The most unexpected meeting was reportedly set for this weekend with Mitt Romney, the 2012 presidential nominee who was the party's most outspoken critic of Trump during the race.\n\nTrump plans to move the transition meetings to the private Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, starting Friday. The Trump-Romney meeting is expected to take place there, as Trump plans to stay in Bedminster until Sunday night.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a transition team member who is a potential pick for U.S. attorney general, commented, \"There are a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with, and I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things.\"\n\nRomney is reportedly under consideration for secretary of state, although this could not be confirmed. Other possible candidates to lead the State Department include Nikki Haley, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John R. Bolton.",
    " Title: White House Welcomes John Boehner's Lawsuit as a Public Relations Boost\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the White House has welcomed the lawsuit filed by former Speaker of the House, John Boehner, aiming to curb President Barack Obama's use of unilateral executive authority. The lawsuit, initially met with mockery by the President, is now being used by the White House as a public relations tool to highlight Obama's executive actions and address a long-standing political challenge.\n\nSince the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, Obama's primary political challenge has been the public's limited understanding of the U.S. constitutional order. The President's inability to pass legislation through Congress has often led to public discontent, with voters questioning the President's leadership and failure to deliver on promises.\n\nTo address this issue, Obama has not only relied on unilateral executive action to advance policy aims but has also made a concerted effort to highlight these actions. The \"We Can't Wait\" initiatives, while small-bore in nature, have struggled to attract substantial public attention.\n\nThe lawsuit, however, has provided an opportunity for the White House to shift the narrative. The specter of a U.S. Congress engaging in a high-profile political fight over the President's use of executive authority has allowed the White House to emphasize Obama's leadership and the obstacles he faces in implementing his agenda.\n\nIn a statement to reporters, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest criticized Republican leaders for focusing on the lawsuit rather than collaborating with the President. The implication is that, were it not for the lawsuit, Republicans would be engaging in constructive compromises with the White House.\n\nWhile this implication may be debatable, the lawsuit has undeniably provided the White House with a platform to underscore the challenges Obama faces in implementing his policy agenda. The lawsuit serves as a reminder to the public that the President is taking action, despite Republican opposition.\n\nThe current partisan debate is often described as a stalemate, but it can also be seen as a situation of Zugzwang, a chess term referring to a situation where the optimal move would be to do nothing, but passing is against the rules of the game. For House Republicans, the best strategy might be to do nothing this summer and fall, given the President's low approval ratings, the GOP's expected midterm gains, and the need to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nHowever, conservative activists are unlikely to tolerate such a passive strategy. They are eager for more overt expressions of opposition to Obama, and the lawsuit, while a milder move than impeachment, may be a shrewd response to this pressure. Regardless, the lawsuit has provided the White House with a valuable opportunity to emphasize the challenges Obama faces in implementing his policy agenda.",
    " Title: President Trump Cancels Peace Talks with Taliban Following Deadly Kabul Bombing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, President Donald Trump announced on Monday that peace negotiations with the Taliban are off, following the terrorist group's claim of responsibility for a bombing in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of an American service member.\n\nThe announcement came after a planned meeting between Taliban leaders and representatives of the Afghan government, which was scheduled to take place at Camp David on Sunday, was called off. The bombing, which occurred in Kabul on August 15, resulted in the deaths of twelve individuals, including a U.S. soldier.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, N.J., President Trump stated, \"It was my idea [to cancel the meeting]. I didn't discuss it with anybody else. When I heard... that they killed one of our soldiers and 12 other innocent people, there's no way I'm meeting.\"\n\nThe President also refuted reports that he had overruled advisers, including National Security Advisor John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, to schedule the meeting in the first place. In a tweet on September 9, 2019, Trump stated, \"I always think it is good to meet and talk, but in this case, I decided not to.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed the President's sentiments, stating on Sunday, \"We're going to walk away from a deal if others try to use violence to achieve better ends in the negotiations. It's not right. It's not appropriate. It killed an American. And it made no sense for the Taliban to be rewarded for that kind of bad behavior.\"\n\nPresident Trump also criticized the prolonged U.S. presence in Afghanistan, reiterating his promise to bring home the approximately 14,000 American troops currently stationed in the war-torn country. In a tweet on September 9, 2019, he stated, \"We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!\"",
    " Title: Media, Politics, and Violence: A Shifting Landscape of Discourse and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent years, the political discourse in the United States has been marked by an escalation of violence and heated rhetoric, with both the left and right wings of the political spectrum engaging in increasingly contentious exchanges.\n\nFifteen years ago, the emergence of the \"angry left\" drew significant media attention, signaling a tacit approval from the media, albeit subtle. This was followed by the Occupy movement, and once again, these groups received media attention, though the media's stance remained ambiguous. The attempted assassination of Congressman Steve Scalise and his colleagues serves as a notable example of the right's violent practitioners.\n\nThe far-right, including the alt-right, neo-Nazis, and the Klan, have also been involved in acts of violence, with the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, being a high-water mark. Although the media does not approve of their criminality, they continue to report on their malevolent behavior, often with inflated figures.\n\nThe left-wing practitioners of violence are generally marginal, but they have more catchy slogans. The theater of operations has shifted to cable television, where the violence is replaced by rhetoric, with insults, vituperations, and occasional syllogisms exchanged. The left poses as mainstream hosts, while the self-proclaimed conservatives remain gentle and refrain from labeling the left as socialists, cranks, or mentally unbalanced, unless necessary.\n\nRecently, the left has escalated its tactics, threatening the right's advertisers. In response, some advertisers have temporarily withdrawn their support, but many, like Mike Lindell of MyPillow, have remained steadfast. The left's threats against Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham are a more recent development, but they have the support of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, a champion of the First Amendment and the owner of Fox News.\n\nTwenty years ago, as Fox News gained influence, the battle lines began to form. The left, which had previously turned on newspapers for running conservative columnists, threatened advertisers, leading to a decline in readership and the eventual demise of many newspapers.\n\nIn response to this growing acrimony, media watchdog Reed Irvine was advised to encourage his army of monitors to write letters-to-the-editor praising the editors for publishing both sides. However, Irvine did not heed this advice, and the media became increasingly angry. Now, audiences are hoping for other media entrepreneurs to follow in Rupert Murdoch's footsteps and break the left's media monopoly.\n\nIn conclusion, the political discourse in the United States has become increasingly contentious, with both the left and right engaging in acts of violence and heated rhetoric. The media plays a significant role in this discourse, with their reporting and coverage influencing public opinion and shaping the narrative. The future of political discourse in the United States remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the need for balanced, unbiased reporting has never been more important.",
    " Title: Tillerson Urges International Community to Implement and Strengthen UN Sanctions Against North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the escalating nuclear threat from North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on the United Nations Security Council to take decisive action, including financial sanctions and diplomatic measures, to prevent North Korea from further developing its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nSpeaking at a U.N. meeting on Friday, Tillerson emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating, \"With each successive detonation and missile test, North Korea pushes northeast Asia and the world closer to instability and broader conflict.\" He warned of the real threat of a North Korean attack on Seoul or Tokyo.\n\nTillerson urged member countries to fully implement U.N. sanctions and to suspend or downgrade diplomatic ties with North Korea. He emphasized, \"Business as usual is not an option.\" The U.S. is hoping to pressure North Korea into dismantling its missile and nuclear programs by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with allies and regional partners.\n\nTillerson also warned that it was \"only a matter of time\" before Pyongyang takes aim at the United States. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who also attended the meeting, condemned North Korea's violations of U.N. resolutions on nuclear and missile testing and development.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who also spoke at the meeting, pledged that Beijing would fully implement all U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Wang stated, \"Due to the recent efforts by [North Korea] to accelerate missile and nuclear development, China agrees to the international community to step up efforts of non-proliferation.\"\n\nTillerson's call for sanctions came as President Trump indicated direct conflict with the rogue regime is possible. In a wide-ranging interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump stated, \"There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely.\" The same day, Pyongyang released a propaganda video simulating an attack on the White House.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Faces Decision on Staying Utah Same-Sex Marriage Ruling as Appeals Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Judge Robert J. Shelby of the Federal District Court in Salt Lake City has refused to stay his decision that overturned Utah's ban on same-sex marriage. This decision was upheld by a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, though they called for \"expedited consideration\" of the appeal.\n\nThe immediate question for the Supreme Court is whether to block Judge Shelby's ruling while appeals are ongoing. The state's request will initially be directed to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who oversees the Tenth Circuit, but it will likely be referred to the full court. The court is expected to act within several days.\n\nUnlike the review of decisions from federal courts in California striking down Proposition 8, the state's ban on same-sex marriage, the Tenth Circuit did not stay both the trial judge's ruling and its own as appeals progressed.\n\nProfessor Dorf, a legal scholar, suggests that there may not be five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby's ruling. \"On the strictly legal argument,\" he said, \"it's hard to justify granting a stay.\"\n\nHowever, Professor Dorf added that the lower courts should have granted a stay, partly due to the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is unpredictable.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,\" Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it's impossible to say with certainty what they'll do.\"\n\nWhatever the Supreme Court decides regarding a stay, it is unlikely that they can hear the larger issue in the case during this term. However, a decision in the court's next term, culminating in a decision in June 2015, is entirely possible.",
    " Title: John Kasich Suspends Presidential Campaign, Leaves Trump as Sole Remaining GOP Contender\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that leaves Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, John Kasich, known for his conciliatory approach in a year marked by voter anger and the rise of outsider candidates, suspended his political campaign on Wednesday.\n\nTrump, in response, sounded conciliatory, stating that Governor Kasich might be helpful in the Buckeye State for the general election and expressing interest in vetting Kasich as a possible vice presidential running mate.\n\n\"I think John\u2019s doing the right thing,\" Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\n\nHowever, Kasich's decision was met with mixed reactions. Supporters lamented the loss of what they felt was the last source of civility in the race, as the Ohio governor stood out in a campaign marked by personal insults, innuendo, and shouting.\n\n\"If this is his last campaign, he went out admirably,\" tweeted Yahoo News National Political Correspondent Matt Bai on Wednesday.\n\nOthers argued that Kasich, who had finally reached a one-on-one match-up with Trump, only to withdraw, missed an opportunity to rally anti-Trump forces. Despite his limited success in the primaries, Kasich won only his home state of Ohio and was at less than 20 percent in the national polls in a three-man race.\n\nRepublican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus referred to Trump as the \"presumptive nominee\" last night, and Trump is almost certain to amass a winning majority of 1,237 delegates by the end of the primary season.\n\nTrump's vice presidential running mate choice remains uncertain, with Trump expressing a preference for a politician and Kasich providing balance in terms of experience and message. Whether Trump would actually ask Kasich to be his running mate, and if Kasich would accept, remains to be seen.\n\nFor Kasich, a vice presidential slot might validate his quixotic effort and provide a cap to his long and varied political career. However, joining Trump's campaign would mean aligning with a candidate who has shown little eagerness to embrace hope and light, characteristics Kasich often described himself as embodying.",
    " Title: US President Criticizes School Resource Officer Over Parkland Shooting, Calls for Law Enforcement in Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, US President Donald Trump has criticized the school resource officer who did not enter the building during the attack. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday, President Trump described the officer's inaction as a \"case where somebody was outside, they're trained, they did not react properly under pressure or they were a coward.\"\n\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel revealed on Thursday that the 54-year-old school resource officer, Scot Peterson, stood outside while the alleged gunman shot students at the high school. Sheriff Israel said video footage showed Mr. Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said.\n\n\"I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,\" Sheriff Israel said. Asked what Mr. Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: \"Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer.\"\n\nMr. Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. It is unclear if he will face charges.\n\nThe suspect used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being captured later. School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education.\n\nThere are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr. Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper said he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (\u00a354,137).\n\nConcerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about the former student charged with the massacre were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. Calls were also reportedly made to the authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about the suspect, including one saying he was planning to attack the school.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott called for \"active shooter training\" for all students and staff at public schools in the state. He also pledged to make it \"virtually impossible for anyone who has mental health issues to use guns.\" Florida's governor also called for law enforcement officers to be placed in every public school in the state.\n\nPresident Trump, during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, again proposed arming teachers as a solution to school safety, a method long championed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. However, Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed that arming teachers was a suitable solution. \"Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, does not care,\" she said.",
    " Title: Former South Korean General Warns of Religious Zeal Among North Korean Troops in Potential Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling warning, a decorated former South Korean general has stated that North Korean soldiers would fight foreign invaders with near religious zeal, if under attack. Lt. Gen. In-Bum Chun, who spent nearly 40 years in the South Korean military, including a stint leading the country's special forces, made these remarks at a London think tank this week.\n\nChun, who retired only about 18 months ago, described the indoctrination of North Korean soldiers as \"close to ridiculous.\" He explained that North Korean pilots would likely use their planes in kamikaze-style attacks, and that North Koreans receive 100 hours of weapon training annually, starting at the age of 14.\n\nThe general's comments come amid ongoing diplomatic negotiations between North and South Korea, the first in over two years. On January 4, North Korea reopened a military crisis hotline with its southern neighbor after nearly two years of silence, a move that could lower the chances of an accidental war. On Tuesday, Pyongyang agreed to send its athletes to the Olympics in South Korea next month.\n\nHowever, Chun's remarks serve as a stark reminder of the potential bloodshed that could ensue in the event of a war. The general used religious language to describe the North Korean soldiers' fervor, attributing it to the reverence they hold for the Kim family, who have led the country for decades.\n\nKim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un, is still known as the \"Great Leader\" and the \"Eternal President\" in North Korea. Monuments glorifying his reign are everywhere in the country. When Kim Il Sung died in 1994, the Korean Central News Agency, the country's state-run news organization, published a glowing seven-page announcement, describing him as the \"sun of the nation.\"\n\nNorth Korean propaganda emphasizes the racial purity of the country and recalls the hardships endured under foreign occupation. Songs and colorful posters glorifying these themes can be found even in rural areas hundreds of miles away from the capital.\n\nSince Kim Il Sung's death in 1994, his son and grandson, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, have carried on his legacy. The current Kim has made some economic reforms and put more emphasis on improving the nuclear and missile programs. Yet, they deliberately demonstrate a commitment to Kim Il Sung's style of governance.\n\nKim Jong Un even goes out of his way to resemble his grandfather in an attempt to inspire the same admiration his grandfather did. Over 400,000 North Korean soldiers died or went missing fighting for Kim Il Sung in the Korean War. The frightening reality is that many, many more might be willing to fight to the death if war were to break out on the peninsula once again.",
    " Title: Florida Governor Rick Scott Accuses Sen. Bill Nelson of Fraud Amidst Senate Race Recount\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated turn of events, Florida Governor Rick Scott, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, claimed that he has won the closely contested Senate race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and accused his opponent of attempting to \"commit fraud\" to win the election.\n\nThe Florida Senate race is one of three statewide contests that will undergo an automatic recount following the unofficial deadline for counties to report results. As Democrat-rich counties like Broward County continued to report additional numbers, Scott's lead over Nelson has narrowed since election night. Before the recount was ordered, he remained in front by just over 12,000 votes.\n\nGovernor Scott's allegations, made without evidence, suggest that the increase in votes for Nelson is a result of fraudulent activities. Both Scott and President Donald Trump have accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\nThe governor's comments center around two issues that surfaced after Election Day. In one case, Nelson's team of lawyers objected to Palm Beach County's election canvassing board from canceling a ballot cast by a non-citizen, who is barred from voting. In another case, Nelson's lawyers are asking a judge to allow all absentee ballots to count, including those where the signature on the mail-in envelope doesn't match the signature of the voter in file.\n\nGovernor Scott also stated that he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate potential fraud. However, both the department and the secretary of state, agencies that Scott oversees as governor, have previously stated that there is no evidence of fraud.\n\nSenator Nelson and his legal team have maintained that the increase in votes for the incumbent is due to the counting of previously uncounted votes.\n\nAs the recount begins, Governor Scott declared that he has \"already won the race two times\" and intends to be sworn in as Florida's junior senator.\n\nIn response to a request to appear on the show, Sen. Nelson declined.\n\nWith the Senate standing at 51 Republicans to 46 Democrats, races in Arizona (where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema leads Republican Martha McSally) and Mississippi (which is headed to a runoff later this month) are also still to be resolved.",
    " Title: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Expresses Doubts Over Repeal of the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed doubts about the possibility of repealing the health care law. The Kentucky Republican stated on Monday that it is challenging to unravel a law of such magnitude, referring to the 2,700-page health care law.\n\nMcConnell made these comments during a visit to Hardin Memorial Hospital in Elizabetown, where he was discussing the future of health care policy following the Supreme Court's ruling last week. The court upheld the law's crucial individual mandate, which requires individuals to purchase health insurance or face a penalty.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court's decision technically represents a political victory for President Barack Obama, Chief Justice John Roberts' ruling has invigorated Republicans who are eager to portray the law as a new tax. The ruling, which provided the pivotal vote in the decision, classified the penalty as legal under the government's taxing authority.\n\nMany argue that once the federal government passes a massive new entitlement program, such as Obamacare, it becomes nearly impossible to repeal it. However, this perspective is not shared by all. Some believe that the surest way to repeal Obamacare, a law that has been consistently unpopular since its inception, is by electing new members of Congress and a new president.\n\nIf Republicans win the presidential election and retake the Senate, McConnell has stated that he would support using budget reconciliation rules to repeal the health care law. This approach would prohibit Senate filibusters and require only 51 votes to succeed. In 2010, Republicans criticized Democrats for relying on these rules to pass the health care bill, labeling their tactics as unusual and hyperpartisan.\n\nIt is worth noting that Chief Justice John Roberts' controversial decision to uphold the law on the thinnest of grounds may actually make it easier for lawmakers to repeal it. While the constitutionality of the mandate has been resolved, millions of Americans will still be unable to afford health insurance and will choose to forgo purchasing it. In some ways, the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to uphold the law has left the health care system largely unchanged, with millions of Americans remaining uninsured, health care costs remaining high, and all Americans, including those who refuse to buy health insurance, still being taxed.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of the Affordable Care Act remains uncertain, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell expressing doubts about the possibility of repealing the law. The outcome of the upcoming presidential election and the composition of the Senate will play a significant role in determining the fate of Obamacare.",
    " Title: Justice Department Expands Investigation into George Zimmerman, Seeks Public Tips for Potential Civil Rights Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that appears to mark an expansion of the ongoing investigation into George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has set up a public email address soliciting any tips or information regarding the case. This development comes amidst pressure from the NAACP and several Democratic lawmakers to pursue Zimmerman, following his acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin over a year ago.\n\nThe DOJ's move follows Attorney General Eric Holder's Tuesday address to the NAACP, in which he stated that his department would \"consider all available information\" before deciding whether to move forward with a potential civil rights case against Zimmerman. The department also held a conference call with civil rights leaders on Monday, including DOJ officials, FBI agents, and federal prosecutors.\n\nThe conference call, convened by Tom Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, included civil rights leaders from Sanford, Florida, as well as representatives from around the country. This, along with the email address soliciting tips and information, is reportedly a standard procedure for high-profile investigations, as seen in the department's probe of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, police department last year.\n\nWhile some attorneys and analysts have expressed doubts about the DOJ's ability to bring a civil rights case against Zimmerman, given the current state of the investigation, others, such as Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), have already expressed the belief that Martin's civil rights were violated.\n\nIn addition to the investigation, Holder has also criticized \"stand-your-ground\" laws, which allow individuals to use lethal force when they believe their lives are in danger, even if they have the option to retreat. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has criticized Holder for these comments, stating that self-defense is a \"fundamental human right.\"\n\nFurthermore, in his address to the NAACP, Holder recounted his own past experiences with racial profiling. The DOJ's actions and statements indicate a continued focus on the investigation and a commitment to addressing issues of racial bias and civil rights.",
    " Title: U.S. Troop Withdrawal from Syria: A Recipe for Chaos and ISIS Resurgence?\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has sparked criticism from both sides, with concerns that it could lead to a resurgence of ISIS and damage America's credibility as a reliable ally. The decision, announced on Sunday evening, has left the Kurdish-led forces, who have been instrumental in the fight against ISIS, on their own to face a potential invasion by Turkey.\n\nThe withdrawal has been met with dismay, as the Kurds have been key partners in the fight against ISIS, with thousands of lives lost in the process. The Kurds, who have historically been betrayed by Washington, are now left to confront a powerful NATO-allied adversary, Turkey.\n\nThe decision has been criticized for jeopardizing the costly victory over ISIS and potentially leading to the release of tens of thousands of former militants and family members held in SDF-controlled camps. U.S. allies around the world may question their cooperation with a government that so casually abandons military partners.\n\nTurkey, which has been accused of supporting radical and extremist groups in Syria, is now poised to contain the Islamic State. However, putting Erdo\u011fan in charge of this mission raises concerns, as Turkey's history of using radical Islamism as a tool has often led to blowback. The Kurds, who have historically served as a bulwark against ISIS and other unfriendly regimes, are now left without a safe haven.\n\nThe decision also raises questions about the U.S.'s strategic alignment, as Turkey, under Erdo\u011fan, has been more of an adversary than an ally, strategically aligning with both Russia and Iran. The U.S. partnership with the Syrian Kurds occurred only after three years of failed attempts to get Turkey to stop supporting radical and extremist groups in Syria.\n\nThe withdrawal could potentially lead to renewed conflict in one of the only peaceful parts of Syria, and foreshadow terrorism and civil war inside Turkey. The Kurds, who have been a crucial ally in the fight against ISIS, are left with nowhere to go.\n\nThe decision has put Trump in conflict with the Pentagon and his own Republican allies, and may lead to a collision course with Turkey. The U.S.'s credibility as a stalwart partner and a determined adversary is now in question.",
    " Title: Former Presidents Clinton and Dole's Bipartisan Legacy: A Shared Focus on American People\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan-themed address at the University of Kansas on Monday, former U.S. President Bill Clinton highlighted the decades-long relationship he shared with fellow Republican Senator Bob Dole, emphasizing their shared commitment to the American people despite their political differences.\n\nClinton, the 42nd president of the United States, was in Lawrence to accept the 2015 Dole Leadership prize, an annual honor bestowed by the university's Dole Institute of Politics, named after the former U.S. Senator from Kansas. Dole, 92, did not attend the event.\n\nClinton spoke of this era as the most \"interdependent\" in human history, a time when positive and negative forces collide. He underscored the importance of bipartisanship in navigating this complex world, urging a focus on shared goals rather than differences.\n\nAddressing a capacity crowd at the 2,210-seat Lied Center auditorium on the KU campus, Clinton acknowledged the polarization of American politics, not just in Washington but in American life. He highlighted the progress made in overcoming bigotries in the U.S., stating, \"We are less racist than we used to be. We are less sexist than we used to be. We are less religiously bigoted than we used to be. We are less homophobic than we used to be. We have one remaining bigotry: We don't want to be around anyone who disagrees with us.\"\n\nClinton attributed Dole's ability to identify with others to an experience Dole had while lying in the hospital, recovering from wounds sustained in World War II. He described this as a test that we all face today.\n\nThroughout his speech, Clinton referenced shared projects and causes, such as the Families of Freedom Fund, initiated after Clinton left the White House to provide education to the survivors of those killed in 9/11, regardless of citizenship. So far, the fund has awarded $118 million.\n\nThe Dole Institute's mission is to foster civil dialogue about political and economic issues in a balanced and bipartisan environment. Clinton was selected for the prize this year \"for his work balancing the budget and practicing bipartisanship while in office.\" Other recipients of the prize have included former Sen. George McGovern, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former President George H.W. Bush, and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nAfter leaving office in 2001, Clinton established the Clinton Foundation, which funds health care, human rights, and economic development programs both domestically and internationally. Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, is considered the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 race for president.\n\nThe Dole Leadership prize comes with a $25,000 award, which Clinton has chosen to donate back to the Dole Institute. Dole Institute director Bill Lacy stated that the money will seed the Dole Institute's new Women and Leadership Lecture Series, expected to launch in the next couple of years.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Strategy: Establishment Candidates to Receive Unlimited Funding from Super PACs to Counter Tea Party Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is undergoing a significant strategic shift as GOP super PACs aim to support establishment candidates in their bid to fend off challenges from the tea party. Consultants and attorneys, including the co-founder of the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC, are establishing numerous super PACs to support individual candidates running in the 2014 and 2016 elections.\n\nThis strategy represents the most significant reassessment of the Republican Party's outside money strategy since the inception of the super PAC era. The move brings traditional big-dollar donors into primary races that have, in the past, been influenced by tea party-aligned groups.\n\nCharlie Spies, the co-founder of Restore Our Future, which spent over $140 million to support Mitt Romney, explained, \"The prime targets for this sort of a strategy are incumbents that expect a primary election challenge.\" He further stated that established groups like American Crossroads, American Action Network, or Congressional Leadership Fund are more likely to focus on general election races rather than primary contests.\n\nIn recent election cycles, well-established conservative groups such as Karl Rove's Crossroads network and the Koch-linked Americans for Prosperity have largely stayed out of primary fights. However, these organizations have helped unseat more moderate Republicans backed by tea party-associated groups.\n\nSuper PACs, unlike congressional campaigns, are permitted to raise and spend unlimited funds. The downside, however, is that the campaign and the PAC are forbidden from coordinating. The Federal Election Commission requires a strict firewall between a campaign and a super PAC, meaning that a trusted aide usually needs to helm the outside effort.\n\nThis strategic shift mirrors the growing internal conflict within the Republican Party, with tea party and social conservative factions battling more moderate and establishment Republicans. The Senate Conservatives Fund, for instance, has vowed to attack GOP candidates deemed insufficiently conservative.\n\nEstablishment Republicans argue that previous efforts to oust moderates have resulted in the nomination of unelectable candidates, such as Delaware's Christine O'Donnell or Missouri's Todd Akin, who lost winnable general elections for the GOP.\n\nSpies has already set up more than a dozen super PACs in this vein, but declined to discuss the specifics of his efforts. Other top-tier Republican consultants with Senate or House super PACs in the works also declined to comment. However, the names of many of the mysterious groups that have filed with the FEC this year reference key congressional battleground states like Georgia, Arkansas, Idaho, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Alaska, and North Carolina.\n\nOther established super PACs, such as Kentuckians for Strong Leadership supporting Sen. Mitch McConnell or the Fund For Louisiana's Future supporting Sen. David Vitter, are already active. Single-candidate super PACs also indicate that party leaders believe donors are unhappy with the results of big money groups in recent years and are willing to take their checkbooks elsewhere.\n\nThe perceived stumbles of Crossroads in 2012, which budgeted over $300 million on a plan to defeat President Barack Obama and flip the Senate to the GOP, led to immediate recriminations within the conservative movement about Rove's dominance of the outside money apparatus. This means donors are now more focused on metrics and outcomes, according to John Murray, who founded the Young Gun Action Fund super PAC.\n\n\"The donors are refocusing their attention from relationships to accountability,\" said Republican political consultant Brian Wise of Wise Public Affairs. \"No longer can you call a donor and say I need you to write a check for $500,000. You are finding donors are asking for detailed strategic plans. Even if they have an ongoing relationship with whoever is behind the super PAC.\"\n\nIn the special Massachusetts Senate election to replace John Kerry in 2013, a single donor bankrolled the deceptively-named Americans for Progressive Action on behalf of GOP senate candidate Gabriel Gomez. California winery owner John Jordan put $1.7 million behind Gomez, even as major GOP groups like Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity took a pass on the race.",
    " Title: Polling Data Suggests Tightening Race Between Clinton and Trump as Election Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the highly anticipated 2016 U.S. Presidential Election draws near, the once seemingly stable race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has shown signs of tightening in recent weeks. Despite months of polling data indicating a consistent lead for Clinton, the unexpected involvement of F.B.I. Director James Comey has caused a stir, with the renewal of an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as Secretary of State.\n\nAccording to polling aggregators and election prediction markets, Clinton's lead has narrowed significantly. In a polls-only forecast by FiveThirtyEight, Clinton trails Trump by just 3.3 points. In 2012, average polling was off by 2.7 points, and if this trend were to repeat, it could be enough to flip states like Wisconsin and Minnesota from Clinton's column to Trump's.\n\nThere is a degree of variation among polling aggregators, data scientists, and political analysts. While HuffPost Pollster, which excludes outlier polls, currently gives Clinton a 97.9% chance of victory, Nate Silver's model is more conservative, giving Clinton a 68.1% chance to account for increased volatility.\n\nSome, like neuroscientist Sam Wang, who out-predicted Silver in 2012, argue that while individual polls may show a narrow lead for Clinton, Trump's rise should not be mistaken for momentum. Wang explains, \"One thing that\u2019s been apparent is that voters have become entrenched. The movement of voter opinion has been within a narrow range. In finance and other types of statistical analysis, we call this kind of movement a \u2018regression to the mean.\u2019 It happened in 2008, in 2012, and it\u2019s happening this year. When things go too far in one direction, they\u2019ll start to head back to a midpoint. Clinton is now at the low end of where she\u2019s been this season. But if the regression to the mean holds, we should see a little movement back to Clinton. But we\u2019ll see.\"\n\nAs the final weekend before the election approaches, both candidates are campaigning vigorously, and the race remains unpredictable. The outcome of the election will depend on a multitude of factors, and the polls, while informative, are just a snapshot of the electorate's sentiment at a given moment.",
    " Title: Harris Challenges Biden on Race and Busing, Expanding Democratic Presidential Race Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the Democratic debates in Miami saw a significant shift in the race's narrative, with California Sen. Kamala Harris emerging as a formidable contender, outshining frontrunner Joe Biden. Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg were sharp and authoritative, driving the conversation more than Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has consistently ranked second in national and state polls.\n\nThe debates have broadened the possibilities of the Democratic contest, with Biden leading but not appearing as the inevitable nominee, especially if Democrats aim to deny President Donald Trump a second term.\n\nSen. Harris directly addressed Biden, stating, \"I do not believe that you are a racist,\" but she added that his recent comments about his compromises with segregationists in the Senate were \"personal\" and \"hurtful.\" Biden, in response, accused Harris of mischaracterizing his comments on the segregationists and his position on busing.\n\nWhile all candidates focused on Trump, the evening was marked by attacks on Biden, with the implicit and explicit message that it was time for the Democratic Party to move beyond Biden and Sanders, the two septuagenarians who were the debate's central figures.\n\nBiden's performance, in his first campaign debate in seven years, left some of his supporters concerned, as he failed to articulate a clear vision for his presidency. Harris was forceful, displaying the prosecutor's skills she honed as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general. However, her decision to raise her hand when asked which candidates would eliminate private health insurance as part of Medicare-for-All could complicate her appeal to more moderate Democrats in the primaries.\n\nButtigieg also had a strong night, coming across as low-key and thoughtful when discussing the recent police shooting in South Bend, which sparked a controversy that forced him to pause campaigning. \"It's a mess, and we're hurting,\" Buttigieg said, acknowledging that he had taken some steps but not enough to address the issue before the tragedy occurred.\n\nThe debates highlighted the unprecedented diversity of the Democratic field in terms of demography and generation. The participants included six women, two African Americans, a Latino, and an openly gay man. The age difference was striking, with Buttigieg, 37, standing to Biden's right, and Biden, 76, already having served in the U.S. Senate for nine years by the time Buttigieg was born.\n\nThe debates have set the stage for a long and dynamic race, with 11 more debates scheduled, including a second debate in Detroit next month. The Iowa caucuses are still more than seven months away.",
    " Title: Obama's Limited Role in 2014 Midterm Campaign Contrasts with 2010 Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to his 2010 rally where he energized a crowd with chants of \"Yes we can,\" President Barack Obama's role in the current midterm campaign is minimal. On Thursday, he spoke at a private event in the backyard of actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Los Angeles home, far from the public eye.\n\nFour years ago, Obama was at the forefront of the political scene, leading rallies and engaging with voters. This election cycle, however, he has headlined no public campaign events and has appeared in person with only two candidates since Labor Day.\n\nIn 2010, Obama had led three rallies and held political events with five candidates, despite an approval rating of 47%, according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll at the time. Now, with his approval at a low-water mark of 40%, according to the same poll, Obama has been relegated to fundraising and small, targeted photo-ops.\n\nRep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, expressed hope that Obama's appearance with House candidate Ted Lieu was a sign of more such engagements by the president. \"We'd love to see more of that,\" Mr. Israel said.\n\nThe president's campaign schedule will pick up in coming weeks, with a planned rally in Connecticut next week. However, the contrast between 2010 and 2014 is likely to become more evident as the president spends much of his time stumping for gubernatorial and House candidates rather than Senate candidates, due to his low popularity in most states with close Senate races this fall.\n\nDemocratic candidates are distancing themselves from Obama as much as possible. At a newspaper editorial board meeting, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Kentucky, refused to say whether she had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, stating instead that she is \"a Clinton Democrat through and through.\"\n\nThe White House has yet to announce any campaign events with Democratic Senate candidates, though Obama has recorded get-out-the-vote phone calls, radio ads, and videos for them to target specific constituencies. The campaign of Charlie Crist, Florida's Democratic candidate for governor, is wary of inviting Obama to publicly appear with him due to concerns that it would shift the focus of the race to national issues.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg survey found that an endorsement from Obama would leave a more negative view of a congressional or Senate candidate, with 38% saying they would see a candidate less favorably, compared with just 28% who would have a more favorable view after a presidential endorsement.\n\nRepublicans welcome Obama's just-announced campaign stop with Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, with a Malloy spokesman stating the governor is happy to stand with the president and discuss shared views on issues like the minimum wage and gun laws.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders say Obama can play an important role in the campaign, particularly in states with a high concentration of competitive House races. However, White House officials say Obama wants to help Democrats in the weeks before the Nov. 4 election, even if that means staying away from them.\n\nLast week, after Obama said that while he isn't on the ballot this November, his policies are, Republican Senate candidates rushed to produce ads replaying the remark. At Thursday's fundraiser at Ms. Paltrow's house, Obama tweaked the comment, saying instead \"our values\" and \"our ideals\" are on the ballot.\n\nMany presidents have seen a similar downgrade in their role in midterm elections as their popularity wanes. In the absence of campaign rallies this cycle, Obama has maintained a busy fundraising schedule, headlining 58 events so far this year, with another on tap this weekend. This is comparable to his 2010 schedule, according to Brendan Doherty, an associate professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy who compiles presidential-fundraising data.\n\nDavid Winston, a Republican strategist, said the White House has a long-term interest in demonstrating that Obama still has some political capital. \"If there was a sense that he was in a situation where he couldn't help any Democratic candidate, that's just not a good setup for his last two years,\" Mr. Winston said.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Impact of Political Polarization on Family Gatherings During Thanksgiving 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the journal Science this week has shed light on the impact of political polarization on family gatherings during the 2016 Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. The research, conducted by Keith Chen of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Ryne Rohla of Washington State University, found that families with mixed political views spent 20 to 50 minutes fewer at the table than politically like-minded groups.\n\nThe study, which used communication and location technology, found that the effect was three times stronger in areas with heavy political advertising. The researchers used smartphone location data from a company called SafeGraph, gathered via partner applications such as weather or navigation apps that ask permission to log coordinates. The resulting anonymous, aggregated data sets reported the locations of some 10 million smartphones at various points in time.\n\nTo measure the effects of political disagreements on the festivities, Chen and Rohla made some assumptions based on probability. They took their best guess at what precinct a person lived in by asking where their smartphone was from 1 A.M. to 4 A.M., most mornings. For example, if a person's smartphone was most often in a precinct that was 80% likely to have voted for Hillary Clinton, the researchers could then look at where the person spent Thanksgiving dinner and how long they spent at Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe researchers compared meal lengths for matched pairs of families who lived within a mile of each other and had traveled to eat with host families who lived equally close. Families with a higher probability of tearing into each other over the turkey did indeed prove more likely to leave early. They also compared Thanksgivings in 2016 and 2015, finding that families who were more likely to be politically distant yet ate together in 2015 were less likely to do so in 2016.\n\nThe study also found that the diminishment of time together at Thanksgiving tripled in areas with high levels of political advertising. \"It's almost like this drug of political ads is fuel on the fire,\" Chen said.\n\nSome critics of the study note that a presidential election year is different in many ways from the years on either side, so comparing 2015 to 2016 would be of limited use. Chen and Rohla plan to analyze the aftermath of the 2018 midterm elections, but they recognize that 2020 and subsequent presidential election years will better clarify what happened in 2016.\n\nOthers have expressed concern about the use of smartphone data, considering it an invasion of privacy. Chen and Rohla point to the anonymity of the data and the fact that the applications involved require permission. \"They do have to allow the location,\" Rohla said. \"My feeling is that math-geolocated data is going to be at the forefront of a lot of social science going forward.\"\n\nThe authors of the study say they have captured a trend they would like to see disappear. \"I hope the effect is short-lived and that American families find a way past this,\" Chen said. Rohla can attest at least one family\u2014his own\u2014did. \"Everyone learned their lesson in 2017,\" he said. \"It was much better.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Customs and Border Protection Clarifies Refuge for Bahamians Affected by Hurricane Dorian\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, there has been some confusion regarding the entry of Bahamians seeking refuge in the United States. Initially, a statement made on a ferry traveling from the Bahamas to the U.S. suggested that travel documentation was required for entry. However, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Mark Morgan, clarified on Monday that storm refugees are welcome, regardless of travel documents, if their lives are in jeopardy.\n\nDuring a news conference at the White House, Morgan stated, \"We will accept anyone on humanitarian reasons that needs to come here.\" He further added, \"If your life is in jeopardy and you\u2019re in the Bahamas and you want to get to the United States, you\u2019re going to be allowed to come to the United States, whether you have travel documents or not.\"\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump later contradicted this open-arms sentiment, stating that everyone fleeing the storm \"needs totally proper documentation\" to seek assistance in the U.S. Trump expressed concerns about allowing individuals without proper documentation into the country, citing potential security risks.\n\nTrump stated, \"We have to be very careful. Everybody needs totally proper documentation because, look, the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren\u2019t supposed to be there.\" He further added, \"I don\u2019t want to allow people that weren\u2019t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members, and some very, very bad drug dealers.\"\n\nIt is important to note that existing U.S. policy allows for Bahamians to enter the United States without a visa by providing a passport and proof of no criminal record and going through pre-screening conducted by CBP in Freeport and Nassau. The situation remains fluid, and it is recommended that those seeking to evacuate from the Bahamas consult official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",
    " Title: Georgia Grand Jury to Review Fatal Shooting of Ahmaud Arbery\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a graphic video revealing the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, a grand jury has been convened to review the case. The incident, which occurred on February 23, has sparked widespread attention and calls for justice from lawmakers, celebrities, and the public.\n\nAhmaud Arbery was fatally shot after being pursued by two armed white men, Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael. The incident began when Gregory McMichael spotted Arbery jogging and called 911 to report a \"black man running down the street,\" suspecting him of involvement in recent burglaries. The McMichaels, who armed themselves, then tracked Arbery down on the road.\n\nAccording to the police report, Gregory McMichael claimed that he and his son first tried to stop Arbery by shouting, \"Stop, stop, we want to talk to you!\" The father claimed that Arbery attacked his son and they got into a struggle for a shotgun. Police said the son fired two shots. Arbery's family maintains he was simply out for a jog at the time.\n\nThe video, which has since been released, shows a black man running at a slow pace toward a white truck that is stopped in the middle of a country road. Two men are seen outside the vehicle, including one standing on the truck's bed. The black man seems to attempt to run around the truck, and the moment he clears the vehicle, a shot rings out. A brief struggle ensues in what looks like an effort to control a shotgun, and another two shots are heard, according to the video. The runner staggers away and collapses.\n\nThe public developments in the case prompted Georgia's Republican Governor, Brian Kemp, to speak out, noting that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was assisting the prosecutor who has been placed on the case \"to ensure a thorough, independent investigation into the death of # AhmaudArbery.\"\n\nGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr said, \"I am deeply concerned with the events surrounding the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery,\" in a brief statement. A grand jury will be reviewing the case.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted, \"Justice must be blind. Bring # Ahmaud Arbery's killers to justice.\" Other notable figures, including Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have also expressed their concerns and called for justice.\n\nFormer Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., a former prosecutor, questioned why it took the video being released to initiate a grand jury review, stating, \"I guess my first question would be, why did it take the video [becoming public]?\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden also weighed in, tweeting, \"The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.\" The McMichaels remain free until at least June 13, due to Georgia's orders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and some have called for their detention in the meantime.",
    " Title: \"Louis C.K.'s Tweet Sparks Debate on Common Core, as Academic Standards Become a Pop Culture Punch Line\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent tweet, comedian Louis C.K. expressed his displeasure with the Common Core academic standards, stating that they have turned his children's love for math into tears. This week, the Common Core has become a topic of conversation not just in political and educational circles, but also in the realm of pop culture.\n\nThe debate over the Common Core has been ongoing for over a year, dividing both liberals and conservatives. The latest flashpoint came when Louis C.K. tweeted to his 3.3 million followers, \"My kids used to love math. Now it makes them cry. Thanks standardized testing and common core!\" He followed this with several pictures of third-grade math problems he found incomprehensible or nonsensical. Within a day, his original post had been retweeted over 7,000 times.\n\nComedian Stephen Colbert picked up on the social media backlash and amplified it with a segment that ridiculed confusing math questions. Celebrities such as Judy Blume, Maya Angelou, and Matt Damon have also weighed in with critiques on standardized testing.\n\nThe populist attack on the Common Core is not always fair. Some of the most widely mocked examples of so-called Common Core math were featured in textbooks and used in classrooms long before the standards were introduced. The blame for some of the confusing assignments rests on individual teachers, not the standards, which outline what children should learn in each grade but do not dictate lesson plans or homework. High-stakes testing was introduced long before the Common Core and is stressful for some students regardless of what the exams cover.\n\nOpposition activist Jim Stergios prefers to focus on more sober-minded critiques of the \"mediocre quality, dubious legality, and outsized costs\" of the Common Core. However, he acknowledges that the widespread complaints about the standards have become a pop culture meme, which he finds significant.\n\nSupporters of the Common Core acknowledge that the campaign against the standards is taking a toll. Cheryl Oldham, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, stated, \"What harms the cause for improving education in this country is the attempt by the opposition and the media, who should know better, to perpetuate these misunderstandings, until eventually people think they are truths.\"\n\nThe Common Core exams, which require students to write more, analyze complex texts, and perform hands-on experiments, are longer than many states' former assessments. They are taken on computers, which this spring have proven vulnerable to crashes, server outages, and even cyberterrorism. The exams are graded on a tougher curve, leading to high failure rates in states that adopted them last year. Additionally, recent tests given to students in New York featured questions studded with brand names like Nike and iPod, raising concerns about commercialization.\n\nAny parents who saw benefits in the new exams were swiftly drowned out by the chorus of protests on social media. By the tens of thousands, parents have refused to let their children take the tests. They have taken to social media to explain why. And their fury has seeped into pop culture.\n\nColbert aired a series of clips of parents explaining how the tests had rattled and stressed their children. His wry conclusion: \"Common Core testing is preparing students for what they'll face as adults\u2014pointless stress and confusion.\"",
    " Title: President Trump's Grand Welcome in Saudi Arabia Kicks Off First Foreign Trip\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first foreign trip as the U.S. President began in earnest on Saturday, with a grand welcome ceremony at the Royal Court Palace in Saudi Arabia. The president was greeted by King Salman and honored with an elaborate red carpet ceremony, followed by the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner by a Saudi military band.\n\nThe White House staff, including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Joe Hagin, Hope Hicks, Dan Scavino, Sean Spicer, and Dina Powell, all shook hands with Trump and King Salman as they arrived. Trump was also presented with the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Saudi nation's highest honor.\n\nAfter the award was bestowed, the president and king spoke briefly. Their conversation at one point touched on Syria, with King Salman noting that the now war-torn country used to be an advanced nation and pondering how quickly a country can be destroyed.\n\nThe president arrived in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh Saturday morning, marking the kick-off of his first foreign trip. The ceremony at the palace came after the president and first lady Melania Trump landed at King Khalid International Airport around 9:45 a.m. local time after an overnight flight from Washington on Air Force One.\n\nThe Trumps descended down a set of stairs from the plane onto a red carpet, where they were greeted by King Salman. Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Trump exited the jet from the back steps, prior to the president. Ivanka wore an ankle-length dress.\n\nAt the airport, King Salman joined the president for a walk down a red carpet, with the Saudi Royal Guard lined up at attention along either side with trumpets playing. Jets also flew overhead, leaving behind a stream of smoke in red, white, and blue. The first lady followed behind, dressed in a flowing black jumpsuit and a gold belt.\n\nThe president and first lady then walked into the terminal where a coffee reception with King Salman was held. The pair spoke through an interpreter inside the terminal, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe high-profile welcome stands in stark contrast to the low-key reception Obama received in the kingdom last year, when the governor of Riyadh was the highest-ranking official to greet the president.\n\nThe Saudis offered Trump an elaborate welcome, with billboards featuring his image lining the highways of Riyadh and lights bathing Trump's luxury hotel in red, white, and blue lights.\n\nDuring the hours leading up to Trump's arrival in Riyadh, White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted photos of the city's preparations.\n\nThe trip marks the first time a U.S. president has made Saudi Arabia, a Muslim-majority country, his first stop. Typically, Canada has been the first foreign country a president visits.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia, the commander in chief will travel to Israel, Italy, Vatican City, and Belgium. During the trip, Trump will meet with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Pope Francis, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, King Philippe of Belgium, and the leaders of the G7 countries, among others.\n\nThe president will take part in bilateral meetings with the Saudi royal leadership while in the kingdom. The Trumps will join the Saudi royal family for an official dinner Saturday night. On Sunday, Trump will deliver a speech at the Arab-Islamic-American Summit on U.S. relations with the Muslim world and the global effort to confront religious extremism and promote moderation. He will help inaugurate a \"Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology.\" The president will also attend meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council members.",
    " Title: Justice Department Inspector General Rebukes FBI for Failures in Russia Probe, Cites 17 Inaccuracies in FISA Warrant Applications\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, reprimanding the FBI for \"failures\" during the initial phase of the Russia probe. The rebuke comes after Horowitz's extensive report on the investigation's origins and the process used to obtain a surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nHorowitz revealed that there were 17 inaccuracies and omissions in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications for Page. These errors included a doctored email and the failure to include exculpatory information about Page that may have impacted the court's decision to grant the warrants.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioned the FBI's actions during the hearing, asking, \"Were they just all incompetent?\" Hawley noted the complexities involved and suggested that the FBI members' actions were not indicative of stupidity.\n\nHorowitz clarified that he did not reach any conclusions regarding intent but did not necessarily accept the reasons people provided during the investigation. He stated, \"There are so many errors, we couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion or make a determination on what motivated those failures other than we did not credit what we lay out here were the explanations we got.\"\n\nThis echoed Horowitz's statement in his opening remarks, where he made clear that \"although we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence of intentional misconduct, we also did not receive satisfactory explanations for the errors or the missing information and the failures that occurred.\"\n\nHorowitz previously testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee following the release of his report, but Wednesday's hearing before the Senate homeland security panel comes a day after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) sharply criticized the FBI in a rare public order that referenced his findings.\n\nHorowitz stated that both Justice Department attorneys and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \"should have been given complete and accurate information,\" adding, \"that did not occur and as a result, the surveillance of Carter Page continued even as the FBI gathered evidence and information that weakened the assessment of probable cause and made the FISA applications less accurate.\"\n\nAfter Horowitz released his report, Democrats defending the Russia investigation pointed to the lack of a determination of political bias as evidence that President Trump's campaign was not being unfairly targeted. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) indicated that this would be a flawed assumption, questioning whether Horowitz's inability to find evidence of bias really meant that there had not been any bias.\n\n\"Just because you didn\u2019t find it doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t exist,\" Paul said, noting that there could have been 15 people involved whose bias influenced their decisions, but it just wasn\u2019t provable.\n\nDuring his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, Horowitz also said that as far as political bias is concerned, while the launch of the Russia probe itself appeared to be in line with FBI policy, the issue \"gets murkier\" when it comes to the FISA process.\n\nFISC Judge Rosemary Collyer used strong language in her four-page order. \"The FBI's handling of the Carter Page applications, as portrayed in the [Office of Inspector General] report, was antithetical to the heightened duty of candor described above,\" Collyer wrote. \"The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable.\"\n\nThe homeland security committee's leaders each took a step back and offered a big-picture take on Horowitz's findings. \"I would argue that based on what the report reveals about early knowledge within the FBI, we should be asking a more fundamental question,\" said Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). \"At what point should the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign have been shut down?\"\n\nRanking member Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) asserted that the most significant information to come out of Horowitz's work has to do with past and present threats to the country. \"The most important fact that we should take away from this report and this hearing is that Russia, a foreign adversary, engaged in a sweeping and systematic effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that the FBI was right in investigating those who may have been involved,\" Peters said.\n\nHorowitz's report also described how the FBI relied on information gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele as part of opposition research for Fusion GPS on behalf of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Steele's information helped lead officials to approve seeking a FISA warrant for Page, even though the information had not been vetted as required by FBI policy.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, who led the bureau at the time, insisted he was unaware of any impropriety at the time, but told \"Fox News Sunday\" he \"was wrong\" when he defended the FBI's FISA process in the past. Still, he defended his former subordinates by claiming that no one committed any intentional misconduct, despite Horowitz calling for accountability and making referrals for further investigation. At the same time, Comey admitted that there was \"real sloppiness,\" and that as director, he was ultimately responsible.",
    " Title: Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld Challenges Donald Trump for 2020 Republican Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race. Weld, who served as governor from 1991-1997 and held positions in the justice department under President Ronald Reagan, has released a campaign video contrasting his political style with the current president's.\n\nThe three-minute video, titled \"A Better America Starts Here,\" highlights Weld's cross-party credentials as a Republican who was elected in the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts. The video contrasts Weld's record with clips of provocative statements by President Trump.\n\nWeld, who is 73, expressed his motivation for running in an interview with CNN, stating, \"I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy.\" He added, \"So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run.\"\n\nHowever, Weld's campaign faces an uphill battle, as the Republican National Committee has already rejected his campaign. According to a statement, \"Any effort to challenge the president's nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere.\" The statement also noted that 89% of Republican voters approve of the president.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign reportedly raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of this year, significantly outpacing the political war chests of individual Democratic candidates. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was bested by Trump during the 2016 election, has recently been calling for a Republican to oust the president next year. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan have also been mentioned in recent months as potential party challengers to Trump.\n\nSitting presidents do not usually face internal challengers, and only a few have ever been denied renomination by their party. The race to stop President Trump from being re-elected is heating up, with former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg also joining the race. As the primary season approaches, it remains to be seen who will emerge as the main contenders for the Republican and Democratic parties.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry Indicted, Hires High-Powered Legal Team Ahead of 2016 Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, Texas Governor Rick Perry will appear at the Travis County criminal courthouse in Austin today to be booked on charges of public corruption, his lawyer, Tony Buzbee, announced. The indictment, handed down by a grand jury last week, has been met with rejection by Perry's defense team, who view it as an attempt to criminalize politics and potentially damage Perry's prospects as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nPerry, who has been the longest-serving governor in Texas history, has vowed to fight the indictment with the law on his side, as well as a formidable team of high-profile attorneys. This team includes Buzbee, who has won millions of dollars for clients in lawsuits against BP following the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and David L. Botsford, who argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that led to changes in campaign finance laws. Also on the team is Bobby Burchfield, who represented George W. Bush during the Florida recount that decided the 2000 presidential election, and Ben Ginsburg, who co-chaired President Barack Obama's bipartisan committee on election administration.\n\nThe exact payment arrangements for these lawyers are yet to be determined, with Tony Buzbee stating, \"Which of these lawyers will be paid for by the state of Texas and which will be paid by other funds, whether it be a defense fund or whatnot, that hasn't been sorted yet.\"\n\nPerry did not attend Monday's unveiling of his new defense team at an upscale Austin hotel. However, his team has assured that Perry will not hide from the charges and will make public the dates when he will complete the process of being booked, fingerprinted, and having his mug shot taken.\n\nPerry became the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted last Friday. He is facing charges of coercion and official oppression, which carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison, for carrying out a threat to veto funding for the state's public integrity unit last summer. The governor has emphatically stood by his veto and denied all wrongdoing.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case, Republican Bert Richardson, decided against issuing an arrest warrant and instead granted a simple legal summons. Perry is scheduled for arraignment on Friday, though it is possible he may waive this appearance. Michael McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor presenting the case against Perry, stated that the governor may choose to forgo his arraignment.\n\nPerry's spokesman, Felix Browne, confirmed that the governor would not need to appear personally for the arraignment. The indictment stems from Perry's threat to veto $7.5 million in funding for the state's public integrity unit after Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, refused to resign following a drunken driving arrest. The ethics unit is housed under Lehmberg's office.\n\nThe grand jury in Austin, a liberal stronghold in otherwise largely conservative Texas, indicted Perry for carrying out this threat. The case has been ongoing for months, with Perry's $450-per-hour defense attorney, David L. Botsford, being paid using state funds.\n\nAides have stated that the case will not prevent Perry from maintaining his busy upcoming schedule, which includes visits to the key presidential battleground states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina in the next two weeks, as well as a Thursday speech on immigration at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.",
    " Title: White House Clarifies Alterations in Benghazi Talking Points, Senate to Investigate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the White House has clarified its role in the alteration of talking points regarding the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. Reports from Friday suggested that the intelligence community had initially identified the possibility of terrorist involvement, but this detail was omitted in the final talking points circulated by the Obama administration.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, the White House disputed this hypothesis, stating that they made only minor adjustments to the talking points used to prepare Susan Rice for her Sunday talk show appearances. The primary change involved altering the term \"consulate\" to \"diplomatic facility,\" as the Benghazi facility was not formally a consulate.\n\nSenator John McCain, during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation, criticized the Obama administration's handling of the attack, suggesting that the president may have misled the public to support the narrative of diminishing al-Qaeda influence in the Middle East.\n\nChairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Dianne Feinstein, on the other hand, expressed confidence that high-ranking White House officials were not behind the disconnect between the intelligence and the talking points. Feinstein, however, did confirm that Congress still plans to investigate the matter to determine where the disconnect occurred. The Senate Intelligence Committee will aim to uncover who was responsible for the significant oversight that led to the misrepresentation of the events in Benghazi.",
    " Title: Rise in Hate Crimes Invoking President Trump's Name: A Neutral Analysis of Recent Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of disturbing incidents, victims have been subjected to violent attacks, with the common thread being the assailants' expressed hatred towards President Donald Trump. While the connection between the victims and the President's political stance remains unclear, the use of Trump's name during these assaults is a concerning trend.\n\nIn Chicago, a mentally disabled man was brutally attacked, bound, gagged, and subjected to racial and anti-Trump slurs. Another incident, captured on video in November, began as a minor car accident. The victim, when asking about insurance, was met with a violent assault, with some attackers shouting phrases such as \"You voted Trump?\" and \"Don't vote Trump!\"\n\nA 15-year-old student in Maryland was beaten up while wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat during a student walkout protesting Trump's election. In New York City, a man wearing a hat bearing Trump's campaign slogan was attacked on the subway after being asked about his political support.\n\nDuring an anti-Trump protest in Los Angeles, an activist warned of \"casualties on both sides\" and stated, \"People have to die.\" A survey found that at least 2,000 educators reported hearing racial slurs and derogatory remarks against white students in the days following Trump's victory.\n\nChicago, the site of two video-recorded attacks, was also the location of a Trump rally that was canceled due to security concerns following clashes between protesters and supporters. However, these incidents have received little media attention compared to alleged crimes committed by supposed Trump supporters, many of which have been later revealed as hoaxes.\n\nAmong the more notable incidents was a black man in Mississippi who was arrested for spray-painting his own church with a \"vote Trump\" tag and setting the house of worship on fire. Muslim women in Louisiana and New York have also lied about assaults by alleged pro-Trump aggressors.\n\nThese incidents serve as a stark reminder of the importance of unity and respect in a diverse society. As the nation continues to navigate the complexities of political discourse, it is crucial to promote understanding, empathy, and peaceful dialogue.",
    " Title: Constitutional Scholars Debate Legality of Obama's Airstrike Campaign Against ISIS in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nThe legality of President Barack Obama's sustained and targeted airstrike campaign against ISIS forces in Iraq has sparked debate among constitutional scholars. While there is consensus that short-term military operations are constitutionally permissible, the ongoing nature of the airstrikes has raised questions about the President's compliance with the War Powers Act.\n\nLouis Fisher, a scholar at the Constitutional Law Project, stated, \"I think any conflict of a couple days in nature could be justified, but as President Obama said last weekend, this is not going to be for just a couple days or weeks, it could go on for a year or two.\" Under the War Powers Act, Obama is required to report to Congress within 48 hours of the airstrikes commencing, and he has 60 days to convince Congress to support the operation or withdraw troops. The President can extend this period by 30 days if the troops' lives would be endangered by an immediate withdrawal.\n\nHowever, the President has yet to seek Congress' permission to continue the airstrikes against ISIS military targets in Iraq. This has led to legal implications, particularly as the nature of the attacks has evolved. Initially, airstrikes were launched outside the city of Erbil, with the explicit purpose of protecting American citizens. However, recent airstrikes are being conducted to protect the ethnic minority population in northern Iraq.\n\nObama has defended the airstrikes against ISIS near Mt. Sinjar as a \"humanitarian effort\" necessary to prevent genocide. However, the legality of these airstrikes is questionable, as they are not focused on defending American lives. According to Professor Peter Raven-Hansen, \"President Obama, arguably, has no constitutional authority to use American forces in combat to defend foreigners.\"\n\nNot all constitutional scholars agree on this point. Robert F. Turner, a national security professor at the University of Virginia, defended Obama's actions in Iraq. Turner argued that Obama can continue ordering airstrikes against ISIS because they are not a foreign state, but a terrorist group. \"What he's doing, it's not an act of war,\" Turner said. \"He's essentially coming to the defense of Iraq. Nobody recognizes ISIS as a state. They're not set up as a government, they're just a band of terrorists.\"\n\nRegardless of the legal interpretations, the President's pursuit of targeted airstrike campaigns without Congress' approval, and against the advice of his top legal advisors, has raised concerns about executive overreach. If the President continues this course of action, the cries of executive overreach will likely grow louder, even if his actions are warranted and well-intentioned.",
    " Title: Mario Lopez Apologizes for Comments on Transgender Children, Vows to \"Be More Informed and Thoughtful\"\n\nIn an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens, entertainment host Mario Lopez made comments about transgender children that sparked outrage. Lopez, who hosts his own show on the PragerU YouTube channel, later called his comments \"ignorant and insensitive\" and pledged to \"be more informed and thoughtful.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Owens criticized Hollywood celebrities who allow their children to choose their gender, citing Charlize Theron's recent revelation that her 7-year-old child Jackson does not identify as a boy. Lopez agreed with Owens, expressing his confusion and concern about the \"new Hollywood mentality\" that allows children to make such decisions.\n\nLopez stated that it is \"dangerous\" for parents to make a determination about their child's gender at a young age, and that there may be repercussions later on. Owens shared her own experience of going through a \"tomboy\" phase as a child before going through puberty, and expressed concern about the potential emotional impact on children who make such decisions at a young age.\n\nGender and sexuality are two separate aspects of a person's identity, with gender referring to a person's identity as male, female, a continuum or blend of both, or neither. Sex refers to a person's biological makeup, while sexual orientation is about who they are attracted to. Experts say that transgender individuals do not \"choose\" their gender or sexuality.\n\nThroughout the discussion, the two hosts seemed to confuse gender and sexuality. Owens expressed concern about what she perceived as a \"scary trend\" in Hollywood, suggesting that it is driven by narcissism. Lopez agreed, stating that parents need to let their children be children, but also need to be the adults in the situation.\n\nLopez, who is a father of three, stated that conversations and decisions about gender and sexuality should be made during the formative years, but not before that. Lopez also took aim at the #MeToo movement, stating that social media campaigns such as #MeToo and #BelieveWomen are dangerous because people lie, and sometimes those people are women.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Lopez issued an apology, stating that his comments were \"ignorant and insensitive\" and that he would use the opportunity to better educate himself. The LGBTQ organization PFLAG offered to provide Lopez with more education on transgender issues, and the difference between gender, sex, and sexual orientation. Lopez is a registered independent, and during the interview, he stated that he does not talk about politics because he wants to appeal to a wide audience.",
    " Title: Study Finds Google News Search Results Show Bias Toward Left-Leaning News Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report by AllSides, a media bias-rating organization, suggests that Google News' search results are biased towards left-leaning news sources. The report, published on Tuesday, indicates that this bias is not a result of intentional manipulation by Google, but rather a reflection of the general bias of popular websites on the internet.\n\nJohn Gable, CEO of AllSides and the study's author, stated that the bias is due to the fact that most news online and most news consumption online comes from a left perspective. AllSides specializes in identifying media bias and provides balanced perspectives by using a media bias rating system based on popular opinion to rank media outlets as either left, right, or center.\n\nThe report found that the overall bias of Google News is 65% left, 20% center, and 16% right. The position of a link on a page is crucial, as the majority of traffic goes to the very first links displayed on Google, with an estimated one-third going to the first result. The study found that the average position of the first result from left, center, or right sources is significant.\n\nThe first result from left sources averages 1.7 (one of the top two results), while the first result from center sources averages 5.3 (top 5 or 6 results). The first result from right sources, however, averages 12.2, which is below \"the fold,\" meaning users have to scroll down the window on their computer screen before they see their first news article from the right.\n\nAllSides' analysis of the news on a daily basis often finds it difficult to find perspectives from the right when using Google News. The apparent bias could be the natural and unintended consequence of its algorithms and the fact that most news outlets, as well as most journalists, have political views that represent the left side of the US political spectrum. Online news consumers are younger and lean farther left than the average American, which directly impacts which articles Google's algorithm selects and how high it places them on the page.\n\nThe study does not suggest that there is intentional favoritism for media sources from the left, nor does it suggest the opposite. It only demonstrates that the resulting choice of links that Google News provides do have a significant bias in favor of the left. The full report, which includes more detail on the methodology and findings, can be found here.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Debt Ceiling Bill, Sparking Constitutional Debate and Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that marks the first legislative battle of President Obama's second term, House Republicans have unveiled a new debt ceiling bill, setting the stage for a vote this week. The bill, if passed, would allow the government to continue borrowing until May 18, 2013.\n\nThe bill, which includes a short-term increase in the debt limit and a provision aimed at pressuring Senate Democrats to pass a budget, has raised questions and concerns. The \"no budget, no pay\" provision, which withholds the pay of lawmakers in either the House or the Senate if their chamber fails to pass a budget by April 15, has sparked a debate over its constitutionality.\n\nCritics argue that the provision violates the 27th Amendment, which states that no law varying the compensation for senators and representatives shall take effect until an election of representatives has intervened. Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) stated on Monday that the 27th Amendment may not permit Congress to alter its pay in the midst of a current session.\n\nHouse Republican leadership defends the plan, stating that members would ultimately be paid, as they are constitutionally required to do so. The plan would not violate the 27th Amendment, they argue, because it would temporarily withhold pay, as opposed to reducing pay. Under the plan, members' pay would be held in escrow starting on April 15 for any chamber that has not passed a budget resolution.\n\nAs for the debt ceiling provision, the bill does not set a specific limit; rather, it would automatically increase the limit by the amount required to fund U.S. government obligations through May 18. The White House has stated that President Obama would not block the bill if it passes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have generally reacted coolly to the three-month extension, which would still leave other fiscal deadlines in place, including the possibility of a partial government shutdown with the expiration of a temporary budget measure on March 27. However, failing to meet these deadlines would have far less serious consequences than defaulting on U.S. obligations like payments to bondholders.\n\nThe debt-ceiling bill stands as the first legislative test of Obama's second term, following his public inauguration on Monday. The president has vowed he would not bargain over the debt limit, and if the debt cap is not raised, the government would default on its obligations by as early as Feb. 15, according to the Treasury.\n\nIn addition to the debt ceiling, the automatic spending cuts and the expiration of the current budget are the immediate domestic challenges facing the administration and Congress. These issues also present opportunities to tackle the country's bloated deficit, though the president in his inaugural address pushed back on calls to cut entitlements.\n\nBehind the scenes, Obama and his advisers are working on plans to unveil a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, which is expected to be a central topic in Obama's Feb. 12 State of the Union address. The president is also seeking support from a wary Congress for the far-reaching package of gun control proposals he unveiled last week, including an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun purchasers.",

Jeff Sessions Defends Reputation Amidst Allegations at Senate Hearing for Attorney General Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to counter accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia, Sen. Jeff Sessions will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to defend his character and qualifications for the position of Attorney General. The former federal prosecutor and Alabama attorney general aims to emphasize his lifelong commitment to law and order, and the protection of the rights of all Americans.\n\nSessions' opening remarks, as prepared, will highlight his understanding of the historical impact of discrimination and the denial of voting rights on African-Americans, as well as the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community and victims of assault and abuse.\n\nSessions is the first of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees to face a Senate confirmation hearing, and is one of the most controversial nominees. He is a target for liberal groups aiming to obstruct Trump's agenda, with activists for civil rights, gay rights, illegal immigrants, and marijuana legalization pressuring Senate Democrats to oppose him.\n\nHowever, Sessions intends to present himself as a qualified candidate for the job, as well as someone who respects the responsibilities of serving as the country's top law enforcement officer. He has pledged to be worthy of the office and the trust that comes with it, should he be confirmed.\n\nThe chief complaint about Sessions has been over race, stemming from accusations that as U.S. attorney in Alabama in the 1980s he improperly prosecuted black voting rights activists and made racially insensitive comments. He is also accused of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was OK until he learned its members smoked marijuana.\n\nIn 1986, the same accusations derailed his nomination for the federal bench when he was grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions has vehemently denied making racially insensitive statements or holding racist views. He has pledged to uphold the law fairly and equitably.\n\nIn his opening statement, Sessions will outline goals for battling gun crimes, illegal immigration, drug-trafficking cartels, and other criminal gangs. He will also pledge to protect voting rights, support local law enforcement agencies, and build mutual respect between police and minority communities.\n\nSessions' career in the Department of Justice spans over 14 years, during which he tried cases of various kinds, including drug trafficking, firearms, and other violent crimes, significant public corruption cases, financial wrongdoing, civil rights violations, environmental violations, and hate crimes. Protecting the people of this country from crime, and especially from violent crime, is the high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice, Sessions says.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Landmark Gay Rights Bill, House Remains Unresponsive\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant step towards advancing gay rights, the U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a bill aimed at banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Employer Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed with a vote of 64-32, with 54 Democrats and 10 Republicans in favor.\n\nThe bill, which exempts religious organizations and the U.S. military, is designed to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their location, can work without fear of discrimination. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) stated, \"It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens, can go to work unafraid to be who they are.\"\n\nThe ENDA has been introduced in nearly every Congress since 1994. It came one vote shy of passage in 1996, but had not been given a full Senate vote since. Existing federal laws ban employer discrimination based on race, color, sex, nationality, religion, age, and disability.\n\nHowever, the bill is facing resistance in the GOP-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner's office has stated that he does not plan to allow a vote. Boehner opposes the legislation, citing concerns that it will cost small-business jobs and increase \"frivolous\" litigation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's office also confirmed on Thursday that there is no vote scheduled.\n\nIn response, President Obama urged House leaders to bring the bill up for a vote. \"One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do,\" he said.\n\nOpponents argue that the legislation is unnecessary because most private businesses, including the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies, have self-adopted policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C., have already enacted laws prohibiting such discrimination. A June 2013 Pew Research survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults reported that 21% of respondents had experienced unfair treatment at work due to their sexual orientation.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Approves Budget Reconciliation Measure to Dismantle Affordable Care Act, Leaving Replacement Plan in Question\n\nThe House of Representatives has passed a preliminary measure, allowing Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The legislation, which passed 227-198, sets the stage for the repeal of the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama. The Senate passed the same budget measure earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe move allows Republicans to use a procedure known as \"budget reconciliation\" to repeal key provisions of the law. However, there is growing concern among Republicans about repealing the law without a clear replacement plan. Democrats have seized on these divisions and called on Republicans to reveal their plan before gutting the law, which covers an estimated 20 million Americans.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said, \"This is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who led the passage of the law in 2009 and 2010, criticized the Republican's lack of a clear replacement plan, stating, \"For six years they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We see nothing.\"\n\nRepublicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010. With both chambers of Congress and the White House now in their grasp, they finally have the opportunity to do so. However, passing a replacement plan will be a challenge, as Republicans will have to craft a proposal that unites their party and wins over some Democrats, who would need a 60-vote super-majority in the Senate.\n\nThe lengthy and exhaustive process of drafting the legislation to replace the bill will take place across four committees. Democrats have shown no desire to rescue the Republicans over its replacement and have said they are willing to work with Republicans to improve the law but not to repeal it.\n\nIn a rare floor speech, Paul Ryan said, \"We want to replace it with something better.\" However, President Trump, who campaigned on the promise of repealing the law on \"day one\" and replacing it with \"something terrific,\" has offered few details about his proposal.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Trump said Republicans would deliver their healthcare plan to replace the law \"very quickly.\" However, with the repeal and replacement process now underway, it remains to be seen whether Republicans can deliver on their promise to provide Americans with a better healthcare system.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments on Presidential Immunity and Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic hearing on Tuesday, the Supreme Court deliberated on the power to investigate the President, as the court grappled with the question of presidential immunity during an ongoing investigation into the President's business practices.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has objected to subpoenas for his tax returns and other financial records. New York City prosecutors have demanded the documents as part of a criminal investigation into the president's hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels, while the House of Representatives has been seeking to investigate the conflicts of interest of a president who still owns a sprawling business.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that a president should not be subject to investigation while in office. \"We're asking for temporary presidential immunity,\" attorney Jay Sekulow said.\n\nAndrea Bernstein of \"Trump, Inc.\" and NYU law professor Melissa Murray listened to the oral arguments and shared their insights with co-host Ilya Marritz. A few takeaways:\n\n1. Fights between the legislative and executive branches are not normally heard in front of the Supreme Court. Congress and the White House have typically negotiated solutions to such disputes. \"The fact that we're in court is because this president hasn't acceded to those norms,\" Murray said.\n\n2. The phrase \"presidential harassment\" was repeatedly mentioned. It is language that Trump frequently uses on Twitter and his lawyers raised in court. The assertion, Murray said, \"has transformed what would be considered, I think in other times, ordinary and essential legislative oversight into what accounts to bullying, harassment, and mere partisan politics.\"\n\n3. A number of the justices \u2014 including the liberal Stephen Breyer \u2014 expressed sympathy for the White House's arguments against the House's demands for documents, but they were far more skeptical about the claim that the president is immune from even criminal investigation. \"The court seemed not to be amenable to that kind of argument at all,\" Murray said.\n\nThe justices are expected to deliver a decision in the cases \u2014 Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank, and Trump v. Vance \u2014 this summer.\n\nFor more updates on the ongoing investigations, sign up for email updates from WNYC and \u2588\u2588\u2588.

    " Title: Right-wing Media's Denial of Racism: A Dangerous Fiction in the Face of Racist Rants and Supreme Court Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of recent controversial remarks from Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, the issue of racism in America has once again come to the forefront. However, some right-wing media personalities have dismissed the existence of racism, a stance that has been criticized as dangerous and harmful to minority communities.\n\nFor instance, Fox News' Eric Bolling has asserted that there is no racism, echoing a common refrain within the conservative media bubble. Similarly, Fox contributor Charles Krauthammer has argued that policies protecting against racial discrimination are no longer necessary because they are seen as giving \"advantages\" to minorities who were once disadvantaged. Co-host of Fox's The Five, Andrea Tantaros, has stated that civil rights laws are no longer needed \"because there is equality.\" Bill O'Reilly has characterized racism as an \"individual problem\" and not a \"country problem,\" and has suggested that America's history of discrimination is \"all in the past.\"\n\nThis denial of racism provides cover for intolerance on the fringe. In the last month, right-wing media propelled Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy to folk hero status for evading millions in federal taxes, only to distance themselves when he was caught on tape questioning the welfare of African Americans. Similarly, billionaire Donald Sterling, the owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, was banned for life from the NBA after his alleged racist comments to his mistress were exposed.\n\nWhile many Fox News hosts and contributors eventually condemned Bundy and Sterling's racism, the rhetoric is reminiscent of right-wing media's stereotypes of minorities and denial of the existence of racism. In the wake of their racist rants, both Bundy and Sterling denied they held any racist views.\n\nBundy and Sterling are extreme examples of cognitive dissonance, but the racism-denialist mindset is a pervasive and dangerous one. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Schuette v. BAMN, which effectively overturned decades of civil rights precedent and gutted a core component of equal protection law, is evidence of this.\n\nAs Jeffrey Toobin described, the conservative majority took the position of \"blame-shifting,\" suggesting that \"the debate over affirmative action should and could take place in a genteel, controversy-free zone.\" In her dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote about a country where the Bundys and Sterlings still hold considerable sway. Indeed, she went beyond the simple bigotry of the Bundys and Sterlings and found that more subtle wounds of racism still exist in this country. \"Race matters,\" she wrote, \"because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: 'I do not belong here.'\"\n\nDecisions made and policies created on the premise that racism no longer exists in America have incredibly damaging impacts on civil rights and minority communities. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Michigan is evidence of that. The ruling opened a door for state majorities to change their political systems to unfairly disadvantage minorities, a decision that has dangerous consequences, particularly in a state like Michigan where white Americans are the overwhelming majority. Such consequences are already being felt by minority students in Michigan. In addition to racist incidents and racial tensions on campuses around the country, the enrollment of African-American students in Michigan has seen a dramatic decrease.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent tossing aside of history and legal precedent is reminiscent of the court's June 2013 blow to voting rights, a decision also made on the premise that racism no longer exists in America, but in reality had a negative impact on minorities. In the June 25 decision, the conservative majority invalidated the provision within the Voting Rights Act that prevents states and local jurisdictions from enacting racially discriminatory election practices. States wasted no time after the Supreme Court's gutting of the Voting Rights Act pushing highly restrictive voting laws that history has shown serve to make it harder for minorities to cast a vote.\n\nApparently, inside the conservative bubble, it's easy to praise such devastating policies so long as you deny the existence of racism at all, a refrain that ultimately helps keep discrimination alive.",
    " Title: \"Neil Gorsuch: A Look into the Judicial Philosophy of the U.S. Supreme Court Justice\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent lecture at Case Western University School of Law, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch expressed his views on the need for reform of the civil justice system and paid tribute to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whom he succeeded on the bench.\n\nGorsuch, who was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, initially spoke about the complexities and high costs of the civil justice system, advocating for reform to make it more accessible for all. However, the sudden death of Scalia during his contemplation of the topic led him to shift his focus to the legacy of the influential jurist.\n\nIn his lecture titled \"Of Lions and Bears, Judges and Legislators, and the Legacy of Justice Scalia,\" Gorsuch outlined his and Scalia's shared judicial philosophy. He emphasized that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing on text, structure, and history to understand the law at the time of the events in question. Gorsuch argued against deciding cases based on personal moral convictions or policy preferences.\n\nGorsuch also highlighted the importance of impartiality among judges, stating that they should regularly issue judgments with which they may disagree, as they believe that is what the law demands. He expressed his belief that the traditional account of the judicial role, which Scalia defended, will endure.\n\nHere are five key things to know about Neil Gorsuch:\n\n1. Gorsuch was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1967.\n2. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School.\n3. He served as a clerk for Justice Byron R. White and Judge David B. Sentelle.\n4. He worked in the Department of Justice and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n5. President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017, and he was confirmed by the Senate in April of the same year.\n\nIn a separate article, we delve deeper into the reasons behind Trump's choice of Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee and the case for and against his appointment.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Initiates Process to Dismantle Affordable Care Act, Sparking Debate Over Replacement Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives commenced the process of dismantling the Affordable Care Act on Friday, approving a budget resolution on a largely party-line vote. The Senate passed the measure earlier this week, allowing Republicans on Capitol Hill to use a process known as \"budget reconciliation\" to roll back major parts of the health care law.\n\nThe vote saw only nine Republicans crossing party lines to side with Democrats against the measure. No Democrats voted for the resolution. The focus of the debate was clearly on Obamacare, which is expected to dominate much of the time in Washington in the coming months.\n\nRepresentative Justin Amash, the leader of a group of libertarian Republican members, opposed the measure due to broader concerns about government spending. The budget resolution, which also approved budget guidelines for the current fiscal year, was described by Amash as the \"most massive budget in U.S. history,\" adding more than $9 trillion to the debt over the next decade.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who polled Republicans on their concerns before Friday's big vote, stated, \"This is a signal that we are very serious about what we've campaigned on for years. It's the very beginning.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, in a rare floor speech, likened the process to a \"rescue mission\" to fix the ailing healthcare law. \"My colleagues, this experiment has failed. This law is collapsing as we speak. And we have to step in before things get even worse,\" Ryan said.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who led the passage of the law in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats controlled the House, accused Republicans of attempting to \"cut and run\" on people with health insurance and argued that Republicans would end up cutting Medicare benefits as well.\n\nThe budget reconciliation process allows Republicans to skirt a filibuster in the Senate, but it only works for fiscal measures in the healthcare law, leaving untouched some of the more popular slices, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26.\n\nThe vote clears the decks for Republicans to begin working on a repeal of the law, but the larger debate has engulfed the Capitol over how and when Republicans would replace the law. The debate over replacement has exposed some rifts within the Republican Party, with conservative and moderate members expressing concerns about the timeline and the lack of detailed replace plans, respectively.\n\nThe budget concerns have prompted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to vote against his party and the bill in the Senate, though Republicans still had the votes needed to pass it. The resolution is seen as a shell for the budget, and not the final numbers. Any replacement measure unrelated to the budget will have to clear 60 votes in the Senate, a prospect that requires Democratic support, as Republicans only have a 52-seat majority. Republicans also have several competing plans to replace Obamacare, and No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn has indicated that the party may opt to move smaller pieces of legislation as opposed to one overarching replacement.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Fundraising Gap: 2020 Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Outpace Incumbent President in Cash Haul\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidates, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, participated in the seventh Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season at Drake University campus in Des Moines, Iowa on January 14, 2020.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, President Donald Trump finds himself outraised by the Democratic presidential candidates in the year preceding his reelection bid. According to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings and campaign statements, the Democratic primary field collectively raised more than triple the amount Trump raised in 2019. This is an unprecedented situation for an incumbent president this century.\n\nIn 2012, the main Republican challengers to President Barack Obama barely surpassed the incumbent's 2011 fundraising totals. Similarly, President George W. Bush narrowly outraised his challengers in 2003, the year before he won reelection in 2004.\n\nSarah Bryner, director of research and strategy at the Center for Responsive Politics, commented, \"The field is trouncing Trump in fundraising, and that is unprecedented.\" Bryner attributes this cash edge to a Democratic voter base that has been energized and motivated since Trump's 2016 election. She suggests that the pace of donations could reflect a dislike of Trump more than a fondness for any particular candidate, although Democratic contender and prolific fundraiser Sen. Bernie Sanders has a devoted following.\n\nTrump still had a fundraising advantage over any of his potential challengers entering 2020. His campaign reported raising $46 million in the fourth quarter, higher than Sanders' $34.5 million, the largest haul in the Democratic field. However, the Trump campaign had a head start, accumulating over $100 million in cash while Democratic primary candidates compete for donors. Most Democratic campaigns will not announce their cash on hand numbers until the end of the month.\n\nThe fundraising figures for Trump, his two predecessors, and their challengers in the year prior to their reelection bids are listed and visualized below. Total receipts, which include transfers from other campaign committees, and contributions from individuals are listed separately.",
    " Title: \"Democratic Presidential Debate Narrows Down to Six Candidates as Tensions Rise Ahead of Iowa Caucuses\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the first Democratic presidential debate of 2020 approaches in Des Moines, the once-crowded field of candidates has narrowed to six contenders: Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar; former Vice President Joe Biden; Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana; and billionaire Tom Steyer. The debate, hosted by CNN, is set for Tuesday night, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe competition among the candidates has become more intense, with the narrative shifting as the race heats up. The rift between Senators Sanders and Warren, who are both vying for the progressive vote, has become more pronounced. If they fail to consolidate a solid base, they risk handing a victory to Joe Biden.\n\nThe debate is being described as a \"battle for heads, not hearts\" and a \"battle for the soul of the Democratic Party.\" The Washington Post has termed it as \"Tight polls, impeachment, billionaire wild cards: Uncertainty reigns in run up to Tuesday's Democratic debate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a different part of the country, Texas Governor Greg Abbott presented the Governor's Medal of Courage to Jack Wilson, a former reserve deputy sheriff who took out a shooter who opened fire in a Fort Worth church in late December. Two members of the church were killed, and Wilson, 71, heads up the church's volunteer security squad.\n\nPresident Trump will hold a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday, the latest in a series of campaign rallies. However, the rally has caused controversy among students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, with some deeming it a \"hate\" rally. The university's chancellor, Mark Mone, has clarified that the campus has naming rights for the venue but does not own or control the site.\n\nIn a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of U.S. adults said the federal government should have \"a lot of responsibility\" in reducing economic inequality in the U.S., with 75% of Democrats and 44% of Republicans agreeing. Large businesses and corporations, state governments, and wealthy individuals also received significant responsibility ratings, while churches and religious organizations received the least support.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses Baltimore Riots: Six Points on Race and Social Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Barack Obama, during a scheduled news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, took a detour to address the ongoing Baltimore riots, offering a six-point plan that delved into the root causes of the unrest and the need for societal change.\n\n1. Sympathies for Freddie Gray's Family and Injured Police Officers\n\nPresident Obama expressed his condolences to the family of Freddie Gray, the man whose death in police custody sparked the riots, while also sympathizing with the police officers who were injured during the unrest.\n\n2. Condemnation of Violence\n\nThe President made it clear that the rioters' actions, which included looting and destruction of property, were not protests or statements, but acts of violence and theft.\n\n3. Focus on Peaceful Protests and Defusing Violence\n\nObama emphasized that focusing solely on the violence in Baltimore distracts from the peaceful protests and the efforts of those trying to defuse the situation.\n\n4. Ongoing Efforts on Police Reform\n\nThe President highlighted his commitment to police reform, mentioning his task force on policing and his efforts to collaborate with local communities to implement recommended changes.\n\n5. Acknowledgment of Limitations\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged that he cannot federalize every police force and force them to retrain, but he can work with them to facilitate change from within.\n\n6. Call for Societal Change and Responsibility\n\nIn his most passionate point, Obama called for a national soul-searching, urging society to take responsibility for the children in disadvantaged communities, many of whom are black, and to prioritize their well-being.\n\nThe President concluded by stating that he will continue to address race and inequality, but in the context of other priorities, such as criminal justice reform, job training, early childhood education, and his mentoring program for black youth called \"My Brother's Keeper.\" However, without congressional funding or local leadership, these initiatives may not make significant progress.",
    " Title: Uncertainty and Controversy Surround Bergdahl-Taliban Prisoner Swap\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent prisoner swap between the U.S. and the Taliban, which resulted in the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, has sparked a wave of criticism from lawmakers who view the move as both reckless and lawless. This article aims to address five key questions surrounding the Bergdahl-Taliban trade.\n\n1. The legality of the prisoner swap: House and Senate Republicans have accused President Obama of acting illegally, citing laws requiring that the administration provide Congress notice at least 30 days ahead of releasing Guantanamo Bay detainees. Hearings are being planned, and investigations are being pressed for in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n2. The timing of the prisoner swap: Over the weekend, the administration seemed to flaunt the fact that they had not complied with legislation requiring the president to give Congress 30-days notice before transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo. However, White House aides are now stressing that they had earlier briefed Congress on the outlines of a possible swap.\n\n3. The health of Sgt. Bergdahl: Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) has raised doubts about Bergdahl's health, stating that there is no indication of his grave condition, which was the reason provided by administration officials as to why they couldn't abide by the 30-day notification requirement.\n\n4. The political implications: The prisoner swap is showing signs of becoming a major flashpoint, with the staying power, at least within conservative circles, of Benghazi. Republicans see the prisoner swap as representing all that is wrong with Obama, a go-it-alone president who negotiates with bad foreign actors and flouts the rule of law to achieve his own ends.\n\n5. The precedent set by the prisoner swap: There are concerns about the deal and the precedent it could set for other U.S. citizens in custody, as well as American service members who could be captured in the future.\n\nThe president's move to defy Congress also fuels Republican assertions that Obama is guilty of hypocrisy for railing against a raft of signing statements President George W. Bush issued disclaiming his duty to enforce aspects of legislation he considered unconstitutional. The White House has defended the president's actions, stating that the signing statement was put in for this exact situation and that it is the strongest conceivable example of a commander-in-chief exercising his authority.\n\nThis article aims to provide a neutral and factual account of the key questions surrounding the Bergdahl-Taliban prisoner swap, allowing readers to form their own informed opinions on the matter.",
    " Title: Celebrity Anti-Semitic Remarks and the Apatholypse: A Call for Unified Social Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent incidents, several high-profile celebrities have been embroiled in anti-Semitic controversies, sparking concern and debate about the future of the Black Lives Matter movement and the broader societal response to prejudice. The muted reaction to these incidents has been criticized as a sign of an \"Apatholypse\" - a growing apathy towards social justice issues.\n\nRenowned columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has called out the hateful outbursts of celebrities such as Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others, arguing that their anti-Semitic remarks perpetuate racism and contribute to a dangerous disregard for social justice. In a column for The Hollywood Reporter, Abdul-Jabbar writes, \"When it\u2019s OK to discriminate against one group of people by hauling out cultural stereotypes without much pushback, it must be OK to do the same to others.\"\n\nIce Cube's June 10 daylong series of tweets, which implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks, and DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic messages, including a quote incorrectly attributed to Hitler, have been widely condemned. Former NBA player Stephen Jackson, who has self-proclaimed himself as an activist, has also come under fire for agreeing with DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic sentiments and expressing support for the notorious homophobe and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\n\nThe proliferation of anti-Semitic sentiments among celebrities is particularly troubling given the current political climate and the ongoing struggle for racial justice. President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has been criticized for exploiting anti-Jewish biases, despite the fact that Trump's son-in-law and campaign advisor Jared Kushner is Jewish. The campaign has been accused of using the Rothschild trope to accuse three billionaires of Jewish descent of rigging the November election.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar argues that the scapegoating of Jews by these celebrities is a dangerous and harmful form of prejudice that perpetuates racism. He writes, \"It\u2019s so disheartening to see people from groups that have been violently marginalized do the same thing to others without realizing that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism.\"\n\nThe celebrities' responses to the backlash have been mixed. Some, such as DeSean Jackson and Chelsea Handler, have issued apologies, while others, like Ice Cube and Stephen Jackson, have remained defiant in their beliefs. Abdul-Jabbar writes, \"Their arrogant and irrational response to accusations of anti-Semitism, rather than dissuade us, actually confirmed people\u2019s worst opinions.\"\n\nThe columnist concludes by drawing parallels between the anti-Semitic incidents and the powerful song \"Strange Fruit,\" which was written by a white, Jewish high school teacher, Abel Meeropol, and became a powerful anthem in the struggle against racism. Abdul-Jabbar writes, \"No one is free until everyone is free. As Martin Luther King Jr. explained, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.'\"\n\nAbdul-Jabbar's column serves as a call to action for all of us to recognize and confront prejudice in all its forms, and to work towards a society where everyone is truly free and equal. As Abdul-Jabbar writes, \"Let\u2019s act like it. If we\u2019re going to be outraged by injustice, let\u2019s be outraged by injustice against anyone.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Vows Accountability for VA Record Manipulation, Defends Secretary Shinseki\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, President Barack Obama expressed his disapproval of the reported manipulation and falsification of Veterans Affairs (VA) records, stating that anyone found guilty of such actions will be held accountable. The President's remarks came after a meeting with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, who has been detailed to work with the VA since last week.\n\nPresident Obama strongly condemned the alleged widespread problems at the VA, describing the behavior as \"dishonorable\" and \"disgraceful\" if proven true. He emphasized that he will not tolerate such actions and that no one should. The President also mentioned that Nabors is currently en route to Phoenix to investigate reports of misleading statistics about veteran care at a facility there.\n\nDuring his prepared remarks, the President mentioned accountability several times and noted that some employees had already been placed on administrative leave. He also acknowledged the challenges faced by the VA, including an influx of new veterans from recent U.S. military conflicts and an aging population of Baby Boomer veterans. The President stated that there are 85 million appointments scheduled over a year.\n\nPresident Obama defended Shinseki, stating, \"No one cares more about our veterans.\" However, he added that he expects accountability and improvement in the full report on the VA's problems. Earlier this month, Shinseki told NPR's Robert Siegel that he would take swift and appropriate action if reports of two lists of veterans waiting for care \u2013 one for sharing with Washington and another showing wait times that sometimes reached beyond a year \u2013 were substantiated.\n\nThe VA is currently the subject of two main inquiries: an inspector general investigation of hospitals accused of fudging their reported statistics, and a broader audit ordered by Shinseki of all VA health centers. The findings of both inquiries are expected to be released this summer.",
    " Title: America's Ongoing Struggle with Race: President Obama's Reflections on Trayvon Martin Case and the Nation's Silent Dialogue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Zimmerman acquittal in the killing of Trayvon Martin, the nation has been embroiled in a heated discussion about race. However, as Simon notes, this conversation is a topic America often avoids, only addressing it during times of crisis.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in a recent address, spoke candidly about the racial tensions that persist in the United States, particularly within the African-American community. He acknowledged the pain and fear that many black Americans experience, citing personal experiences such as being profiled or having loved ones confront racial stereotypes.\n\nObama's remarks were a departure from his usual political discourse, and some found them more poignant than his famous \"A More Perfect Union\" speech in 2008, where he addressed the racial comments made by his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. In this latest address, Obama emphasized the need for self-reflection and honesty in addressing racial bias, rather than relying on political conversations that often prove unproductive.\n\nThe president's comments come as a response to the nation's outcry following the Zimmerman verdict, but also as a call for Americans to engage in deeper, more personal discussions about race. However, Obama cautioned against political leaders organizing such conversations, suggesting instead that families, churches, and workplaces could foster more honest and productive dialogue.\n\nAs the nation moves forward, President Obama has shifted his focus to economic issues, with plans to deliver a series of speeches on rebuilding an economy that prioritizes the middle class. The topic of race, it seems, has been temporarily set aside, leaving many to wonder if the nation will continue to grapple with this complex and sensitive issue.",
    " Title: APA Survey Reveals Rising Stress Levels Among Americans Over Election, Health Care, and Mass Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA), it has been revealed that sociocultural issues, including the 2020 presidential election, access to health care, and mass shootings, are causing the most stress for American citizens. The survey, titled \"Stress in America,\" polled 3,617 adults across the United States between Aug. 1 and Sept. 3.\n\nThe survey found that 56% of adults consider the 2020 election a \"significant stressor,\" a year before Election Day. This figure is an increase from the 52% who reported the 2016 presidential election as stressful. The election is proving to be a more stressful topic for survey respondents identifying as Democrats, versus those identifying as Republicans, by almost 25%.\n\nThe survey also highlighted health care, specifically its costs, as a notable source of stress for 69% of adults. Mass shootings were the most common source of stress, with 71% of respondents citing them as stressful, marking a nearly 10% increase from the APA's 2018 survey.\n\nOther stressful topics cited include climate change, immigration, national security, and abortion. The APA found that the presence of these \"hot-button\" issues in the news cycle is likely not a coincidence, with 54% of those surveyed wanting to stay informed but finding the news stressful. In response, 39% of respondents said they have \"taken steps over the past year to reduce their news consumption.\"\n\nThe impact of discrimination was also deemed stressful by a majority of survey respondents identifying as part of a minority community. Sixty-three percent of people of color surveyed said that discrimination has kept them from having a fully productive life, while 64% of LGBT adults surveyed reported the same.\n\nStress levels decreased drastically across respondents categorized by age group, the survey found. Baby boomers and older adults were found to have significantly lower average stress levels, while their younger Gen X, Gen Z, and millennial peers reported stress levels above the median point.\n\nArthur C. Evans Jr., APA's chief executive officer, stated, \"There is a lot of uncertainty in our world right now. While there are important societal issues that need to be addressed, the results also reinforce the need to have more open conversations about the impact of stress and stress management, especially with groups that are experiencing high levels of stress.\"\n\nThe APA suggests that the best ways to manage stress are to get a good amount of sleep every night, exercise regularly, and maintain a healthy network of social support.",
    " Title: U.S. Stocks Rise as Tech and Energy Sectors Gain, Dollar Falls Amid Fed Rate Hike Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nStocks rose on Wednesday, with tech and energy sectors leading the way, as surging oil prices pushed energy shares higher. The dollar fell, and Treasuries clawed back from an early retreat amid speculation the Federal Reserve may soften its stance on raising interest rates.\n\nMost major U.S. equity benchmarks were up in light pre-Thanksgiving trading, although they gave back some ground in the afternoon to finish near session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat, while the small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index climbed 1.3 percent to pace the gains. The Nasdaq 100 Index wiped out nearly half of its decline from Tuesday.\n\nEnergy was the strongest group in the S&P 500 Index, as WTI crude rebounded from a one-year low to leap back above $54 a barrel. Apple Inc. surrendered an earlier gain to close down for a third straight day, bringing its loss this week to 8.6 percent.\n\n\"The FANGs were doing all the heavy lifting for the indexes, and now that that's come unwound somewhat, tech had an oversize effect on the rally and an oversize effect on the selloff because it's such a big portion of the indexes,\" said Craig Brothers, head of fixed income at Bel Air Investment Advisors.\n\nFoot Locker Inc. jumped 15 percent, the most since May, after posting strong third-quarter earnings. CBS Corp. rose amid speculation of a coming merger with Viacom Inc., which also saw its stock climb. Gap Inc. added almost 5 percent despite reporting weak earnings as investors appeared to finally buy the dip on a company that had lost almost 10 percent this month.\n\nThe dollar weakened after MNI reported the Fed is considering ending a cycle of interest rate hikes as early as the spring. In addition, U.S. data showed that durable goods orders declined, and filings for unemployment benefits rose.\n\n\"The market is really trading on technicals, a lot of the tech names are very overvalued,\" Rahul Shah, chief executive officer of Ideal Asset Management, said. \"For a name like Apple, you could argue that some buyers are coming in at this level. But overall, today's action might be an oversold bounce. I wouldn't read it as a shift in the tenor of the market.\"\n\nBanks and telecommunications companies led an advance in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index as optimism for a compromise on Italy's budget buoyed stocks. The euro gained and Italian bonds firmed on reports the Italian government may be open to budget revisions as the European Union took a first step toward imposing fines on the country.\n\nApple's plunge Tuesday hit suppliers in Asia, sending the leading benchmark tracking Asia-Pacific stocks lower. Oil investors are weighing industry data that showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell last week against doubts about OPEC's plans to cut output.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains susceptible to the volatility that's rocked markets since October. Traders are having to contend with the Trump Administration's trade war, as well as the president's calls on the Federal Reserve to back off from raising rates as corporate credit spreads at two-year highs reflect investor angst about borrowing costs.\n\n\"There are still concerns, particularly over China and the path of the Fed, and that will likely continue,\" said Jennifer Ellison, principal at San-Francisco based BOS, which manages $4.5 billion. \"It's part of the volatility we're in.\"\n\nElsewhere, emerging-market shares climbed, and an index tracking developing-nation currencies reached the highest since August. Bitcoin advanced after a recent sell-off. It's a shortened trading week because of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. In addition, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, marks the traditional start to the U.S. holiday shopping season.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 2,649.93, and the Nasdaq 100 gained 0.8 percent. The Japanese yen declined 0.3 percent to 113.07 per dollar. The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index rose 0.1 percent to the highest since August. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.0609 percent. Germany's 10-year yield climbed three basis points to 0.376 percent. Britain's 10-year yield added one basis point to 1.396 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2 percent to $54.48 a barrel, the largest gain in seven weeks.",
    " Title: President Obama Praises Ongoing National Dialogue on Race Relations as Healthy for U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with NPR, President Barack Obama expressed his belief that the ongoing national dialogue about race relations, particularly minority communities' interactions with law enforcement, is a healthy development for the United States. He suggested that this dialogue could lead to long-term solutions.\n\nThe President, who recorded the interview before departing for a two-week Hawaiian vacation, stated that the nation is no more racially divided than it was six years ago. He viewed the protests in cities like New York and Ferguson not as evidence of increased racial tensions, but as a sign that the issue has come to the forefront in a way that could foster progress.\n\n\"I actually think that the issue has surfaced in a way that probably is healthy,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new; that dates back a long time. It\u2019s just something that hasn\u2019t been talked about, and for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nThe President has addressed the issue multiple times in recent months, including after grand jury decisions in New York and Ferguson not to charge white police officers in connection with the deaths of black men. He also condemned violence after a gunman assassinated two NYPD officers, with the shooter claiming he acted in retaliation against law enforcement for its treatment of the black community.\n\nOn a broader note, the President said many white Americans hold certain beliefs on racially tinged issues that stem not from racism but from a lack of information or social awareness. For instance, he said white Americans may not understand that African-Americans statistically are more likely to be pulled over by police.\n\n\"If you\u2019d asked whites in those jurisdictions \u2014 \u2018Do you think traffic stops were done fairly?\u2019 \u2014 the majority of whites probably would say yes because it\u2019s not something they experience,\" Mr. Obama said. \"It\u2019s not because of racism. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not something that they see.\"",
    " Title: Ted Cruz Outlines Strategy for Uniting Republican Delegates and Trump Supporters Ahead of Contested Convention\n\nIn an interview with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann for Bloomberg Television's With All Due Respect, Senator Ted Cruz has expressed his intentions to win over Donald Trump's supporters, even if he does not secure the support of Trump himself. Cruz, who has been dubbed the \"last man standing\" against the front-runner, believes his campaign's focus on issues such as illegal immigration, securing the border, and job creation resonates with Trump's blue-collar base.\n\nCruz stated, \"The issues that energize and excite the Trump voters\u2014illegal immigration, securing the border, keeping this country safe, and bringing jobs back to America\u2014bringing them back from China, back from Mexico\u2014those issues are right at the heart of our campaign.\" He further added, \"I believe if I earn a majority of the delegates in Cleveland, that we are going to be able to continue to energize and unite those Trump supporters and get them to come out and vote in November.\"\n\nAlthough Trump has been successful in most contests among voters who have not graduated from college, Cruz won those voters in Wisconsin, the most recent primary. Trump has previously warned of potential \"riots\" and suggested his supporters will abandon the Republican Party en masse if he is blocked from the nomination at the July convention. Cruz acknowledged the potential for divisions within the party at a contested convention but emphasized the support he has received from other Republican candidates, such as Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Carly Fiorina.\n\nCruz also mentioned that his campaign is currently examining potential vice presidential nominees, citing the original GOP field as evidence of an \"abundance of good choices\" for the position. The socially conservative candidate declined to offer his opinion on Bruce Springsteen's decision to cancel a concert in North Carolina due to the state's controversial \"bathroom law.\" Cruz argued that both Springsteen and the people of North Carolina have free speech rights, and that the people of North Carolina are entitled to pass laws that reflect their values.\n\nThe full interview is set to air Friday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Bloomberg TV's With All Due Respect.",
    " Title: Georgia's Sixth Congressional District Special Election Results in a Runoff Between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely watched special election, the race for Georgia's Sixth Congressional District has resulted in a runoff between upstart Democrat Jon Ossoff and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. Ossoff, a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, garnered 48 percent of the vote, falling just short of the majority threshold required in the so-called \"jungle primary.\" Handel, the top GOP vote-getter, received 20 percent, comfortably ahead of technology executive Bob Gray, who received 11 percent, and former State Senators Judson Hill and Dan Moody, who each received 9 percent of the vote.\n\nThe runoff between Handel and Ossoff will determine the successor to Tom Price, who resigned to become Trump's health and human services secretary. Ossoff, who sought to capitalize on opposition to President Donald Trump, attracted more than $8 million in donations, primarily from outside the state.\n\nRepublicans nationally and in Georgia acknowledged before polls opened that Ossoff would likely top the slate of 11 Republicans, five Democrats, and two independents who appeared on one primary ballot. Earlier Tuesday, the GOP criticized Ossof for living outside the district and portrayed him as a liberal Democrat who would increase taxes and take away guns.\n\nOssoff acknowledged Tuesday that he lives just south of the district, in Atlanta, so that his girlfriend is close to her work at Emory University's medical complex. Republican groups ran a blitz of ads trying to tie Ossoff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and spent over $2 million on these and other attacks.\n\nTrump himself posted several messages on Twitter encouraging Republicans to vote in the special election and recorded a get-out-the-vote call, saying \"Liberal Democrats from outside of Georgia are spending millions and millions of dollars trying to take your Republican congressional seat away from you. Don't let them do it.\"\n\nTrump posted another tweet early Wednesday, saying \"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG 'R' win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!\"\n\nNational attention on the Georgia race, already significant, intensified after last week's closer-than-expected GOP victory in a Kansas special House election. Trump did not perform as well as other Republicans last November in the Georgia district, an affluent, well-educated swath of Atlanta's northern suburbs filled with the kind of voters Democrats need if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year.\n\nHandel has maintained her distance from Trump, rarely discussing him unless asked. Polling day took a bizarre turn in the district when key electronic voting logs were swiped from a Cobb County poll worker's pickup truck. The chairman of the county's Republican Party told reporters the theft raised the specter of fraud. However, there were no reports of voting irregularities at Cobb County polling places Tuesday. The runoff between Ossoff and Handel will take place on June 20.",
    " Title: Majority of Scientists Agree: Humans Contribute to Climate Change, Yet Public Doubt Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study reveals a 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming. Yet, a significant portion of the American public continues to question the reality of climate change.\n\nGordon Gauchat, an associate professor of sociology from the University of Wisconsin, suggests that the lack of trust in scientists is one reason for the ongoing debate. He points out that most Americans cannot name a living scientist, and the closest many may get is the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper from CBS's sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\n\nAnthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, explains that there are six categories of people who respond differently to the issue of climate change. The \"Alarmed\" (16% of the public) believe climate change is an urgent problem but have no clear idea of how to fix it. The \"Concerned\" (27%) believe climate change is a problem but think it's more about polar bears and tiny islands than a problem that directly affects them.\n\nThe \"Cautious\" (23%) are people on the fence, unsure whether global warming is real or man-made. The \"Disengaged\" (5%) are uninformed about climate change, while the \"Doubtful\" (12%) do not think climate change is man-made but rather a natural phenomenon with no long-term risk.\n\nHowever, it's the \"Dismissives\" (15%) who are the most problematic, according to Leiserowitz. This group denies the existence of climate change, claiming it's a hoax, scientists are making up data, or it's a U.N. conspiracy.\n\nFormer presidential candidate Rick Santorum and tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz are among those who have publicly denied climate change, contributing to the ongoing debate. The climate change \"counter movement\" has also received financial support from powerful fossil fuel industries, with conservative foundations and others investing $558 million between 2003 and 2010, according to a recent study by Drexel University.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are signs of progress. Extreme weather events are forcing people to think about the impact of global warming on their lives, and religious leaders, including evangelicals, are increasingly acknowledging the reality of climate change and the moral obligation to protect the planet. The Pope may soon release an encyclical on ecology, instructing the faithful to respect the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while a significant portion of the American public continues to question the reality of climate change, the overwhelming consensus among scientists remains that humans are contributing to global warming. As extreme weather events and the voices of religious leaders grow louder, the uninformed minority may soon find their voices quieted by nature and those who have powerful voices.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Officials Clarify Conditions for Airstrikes Against Islamic State in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of statements on Monday, U.S. military officials provided varying explanations regarding the conditions that would trigger U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria. The clarifications came after Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey appeared to tone down earlier comments he made about the growing threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOn Sunday, Gen. Dempsey, speaking to reporters on board a military plane traveling to Afghanistan, said he believes the Sunni insurgent group, formerly known as ISIS, is a regional threat, and he would not recommend airstrikes in Syria until they have become a direct threat to the U.S. He also stated that the group is not currently plotting or planning attacks against the U.S. or Europe.\n\nHowever, Dempsey's spokesman, Col. Ed Thomas, clarified to Fox News on Monday that Dempsey \"believes that ISIS is a regional threat that will soon become a threat to the United States and Europe.\" Thomas added that Dempsey is preparing options to \"address\" ISIS in both Iraq and Syria \"with a variety of military tools including airstrikes,\" and believes a coalition of partners is necessary to confront the threat.\n\nA senior U.S. Defense spokesman told Fox News that the judgment on whether the Islamic State is a threat against the homeland is just one trigger for U.S. airstrikes in Syria. The official said, \"Any threats against U.S. personnel and interests could drive action against ISIL in Syria.\"\n\nLast week, Gen. Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke in dire terms about the threat posed by the Islamic State, with Dempsey saying the organization could not be defeated without some action in Syria. However, on Monday, the senior U.S. Defense spokesman said the message was the U.S. and its allies need a \"long-term strategy\" to separate ISIS from the population. \"In the meantime, if we see a plot against the homeland, of course we'll attack it,\" the official said.\n\nAsked Monday on Fox News whether the White House had pushed back on military officials' statements from last week, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said no. \"There has been no direction from the White House or anybody else to tone down the way we're speaking about ISIL,\" Kirby said.\n\nISIS has repeatedly made threats to attack the U.S. through social and conventional media. Earlier this month, in a Vice News documentary, a spokesman for the group vowed to \"raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\" The group took over Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, in June, and has since declared an Islamic state, or caliphate, in a swath of territory covering northeastern Syria and northern and western Iraq. U.S. airstrikes and a new policy of direct military aid to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have served as a check on a threatened ISIS advance toward Kurdish territory in northern Iraq.\n\nOn Sunday, Gen. Dempsey contrasted ISIS with the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has plotted and attempted attacks against the U.S. and Europe. As a result, the U.S. has conducted counterterrorism strikes against the group within Yemen. Dempsey said that so far, there is no sign that the Islamic State militants are engaged in \"active plotting against the homeland,\" so it's different than that which we see in Yemen.\n\nGen. Dempsey also told reporters that he believes that key allies in the region -- including Jordan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia -- will join the U.S. in quashing the Islamic State group. \"I think ISIS has been so brutal, and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned, that I think they will be willing partners,\" said Dempsey. He added that those regional partners could come together and squeeze the Islamic State group \"from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them.\" It has to happen with them, much less with us.\"\n\nUp to now, when asked about airstrikes inside Syria, Dempsey and Hagel have said all options remain on the table. However, so far, there has been no broader authorization for such operations. The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State. Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops.\n\nSenior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis. Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government. One possibility, said Dempsey, would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force. He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia. So far, Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat. To date, U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq. Of those, 62 have been around the Mosul Dam.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans and Democrats Face Off Over Sequester Cuts as Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense exchange on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming reiterated the country should brace for the sequester and its automatic spending cuts to take effect on March 1, despite a recent Democratic proposal to delay the cuts.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts, aimed at reducing the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, were initially scheduled to begin at the start of the year. However, in the scaled-back fiscal cliff bill, Congress postponed the cuts by two months. With less than two weeks remaining, lawmakers are once again faced with a countdown before the widely-dreaded cuts are set to commence.\n\nSenate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure last Thursday to again postpone the cuts. The proposal seeks to replace the budget cuts, which Pentagon officials warn will have drastic effects on the military, with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires through the closing of loopholes, ending agriculture subsidies, and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends.\n\nSen. Barrasso, along with other Senate Republicans, expressed displeasure with the proposal, particularly the provision dealing with tax revenue. \"Taxes are off the table,\" he told CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. \"The American people need to know that tax cuts are off the table, and the Republican Party is not in any way going to trade spending cuts for a tax increase.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during his re-election campaign, vowed that the sequester would not occur, and he called on Congress earlier this month to pass a short-term measure to defer the cuts. However, when his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, was questioned about it on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday morning, McDonough sounded less certain the sequester would be avoided.\n\n\"I sure hope it doesn't (happen),\" he said. \"To 'ensure' the cuts do not take place, the president 'will continue to make very reasonable and balanced proposals, as he has time and time again,'\" McDonough added.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York expressed optimism about the issue. \"I think that Democrats have the high ground both substantively and politically, and we will win on this issue,\" he said on \"State of the Union.\" He argued that Republicans have no choice but to \"come on board.\"\n\n\"Their arguments are untenable and do not meet the favor of hardly anyone other than themselves and the few whose special interests they're protecting,\" Schumer added.\n\nThe standoff between the two parties continues as the deadline approaches, with the potential for significant spending cuts looming over the nation's economy.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Embrace Protectionist Trade Policies, Mirroring Trump's Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate among Democratic presidential candidates, the issue of trade policy has emerged as a significant point of contention, with several candidates aligning their views with President Donald Trump's protectionist stance, despite their disagreements with his methods.\n\nDuring Tuesday's debate, leading Democratic candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Vice President Joe Biden, expressed support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Trump's proposed replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nWhile Warren and Trump claim the USMCA is an improvement over NAFTA, their definition of \"better\" implies less free trade. The new deal includes higher barriers to duty-free trade for automobiles and car parts, imposes new labor standards that increase the cost of manufacturing in Mexico, and has a 16-year sunset clause that increases long-term uncertainty.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a candidate who has consistently opposed free trade, was the only candidate who expressed opposition to the USMCA, citing insufficient measures to address job outsourcing and fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThe agreement between Warren and Sanders on trade policy is largely cosmetic, with both advocating for less free trade than currently exists and supporting more barriers to trade than what Trump has already implemented. Warren's willingness to accept Trump's protectionism as a stepping stone to her more protectionist trade policies indicates a pragmatic approach to policy-making, but offers little comfort to those who favor free trade.\n\nJoe Biden, who has a history of supporting free trade, has been criticized for sending mixed signals on the issue. While he has expressed support for the USMCA, he has also indicated a preference for no new trade deals, a stance that mirrors Warren's position, albeit with fewer conditions.\n\nThe debate's focus on protectionist trade policies could potentially benefit Trump, who has shifted American trade policy towards protectionism. By offering a rewrite of NAFTA that addresses many of the Democrats' concerns, Trump has effectively neutralized the pro-trade voices within the Republican Party and may face an opponent in the general election who is unable to mount a compelling argument against his trade policies.",
    " Title: Analysis: Trump's Approval Ratings Remain Steady Amidst Polarized Public Opinion\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by Pew Research Center reveals a divided nation in response to President Donald Trump's actions and statements. The survey found that an overwhelming majority of Americans (76 percent) express concern, 70 percent feel confused, 69 percent are embarrassed, 65 percent are angry, 62 percent are insulted, and 56 percent are frightened by the things Trump says.\n\nHowever, these numbers do not seem to significantly impact Trump's re-election chances, as indicated by three key factors.\n\nFirst, the positive rating of economic conditions in the United States has increased significantly since Trump's election, with 76 percent of Americans currently rating economic conditions positively, up from 48 percent in 2016.\n\nSecond, the ongoing debate surrounding progressive values and their perceived hostility towards mainstream values is evident in the recent controversy over J.K. Rowling's tweet defending a woman who was fired for her outspoken views on transgenderism.\n\nThird, the increasing hysteria from the left regarding Trump and his alleged catastrophic impact on the nation, as well as their predictions of conspiracy theories, appears to be out of touch with reality as the predicted catastrophes do not materialize, and the conspiracy theories remain unproven.\n\nAs a result, Trump's average approval ratings have been steadily ticking up since the end of October. In the eyes of middle-of-the-road America, the president may be flawed, but he is not as bad as his critics claim.\n\nIn this view, while Trump's critics may have some valid points, they are less accurate than they believe. In a contest between the unapologetic Trump and the self-proclaimed moral arbiters seeking to replace him, the unapologetic Trump might just win.\n\nThe most obvious point is not to promise a drastic overhaul of the economy when it shows no signs of needing such a transformation. The United States faces serious long-term economic risks, including a declining birthrate, a national debt over $23 trillion, the erosion of the global free-trade consensus, threats to the political independence of the Federal Reserve, and the growing popularity of unconventional economic theories such as Modern Monetary Theory.",
    " Title: Nationwide Protests Erupt Over Ferguson Decision: A Look at the Unrest Across Major Cities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, protests have erupted across the nation for the second consecutive night. The demonstrations, while largely peaceful, have resulted in arrests, property damage, and disruptions to traffic in several major cities.\n\nIn Ferguson, Missouri, where the shooting took place, demonstrations quieted down Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning. National Guard units were deployed to protect the Ferguson Police Department, with local officers handling crowd control, arrests, and the use of tear gas. In one commercial area Wednesday morning, a soldier was stationed at every few storefronts, and some were on rooftops. A total of 45 people were arrested, most for failure to disperse.\n\nOutside police headquarters, one woman was taken into custody after protesters hurled what appeared to be smoke bombs, flares, and frozen water bottles at a line of officers. Several other protesters were arrested after defying police instructions to get out of the street or out of the way of police vehicles.\n\nProtests in other cities, such as Oakland, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, and New York City, have also resulted in property damage, vehicle disruptions, and arrests. In Oakland, protesters vandalized police cars, smashed windows at car dealerships, restaurants, and convenience stores, as well as setting fire to trash in the middle of city streets.\n\nIn Manhattan, thousands of people marched, gathering in Union Square and holding up traffic on FDR Drive, Williamsburg Bridge, and the Queens Midtown Tunnel. NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said police were giving protesters \"breathing room.\" \"As long as they remain nonviolent, and as long as they do not engage in issues that cause fear or create vandalism, we will work with them to allow them to demonstrate,\" he said.\n\nIn Cleveland, several hundred people marched down a freeway ramp to block rush-hour traffic while protesting the Missouri developments and Saturday's fatal shooting by an officer of 12-year-old Tamir Rice of Cleveland, who had a pellet gun that looked like a real firearm.\n\nIn St. Louis, riot police arrested several demonstrators on Interstate 44 near the Edward Jones Dome. Protesters disrupted traffic for several hours before they were dispersed by police with pepper spray.\n\nSeveral hundred people from historically black schools Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University in Georgia held peaceful demonstrations. However, as the night wore on, some groups split off and tried to block a freeway, and police said some windows were broken.\n\nIn response to the unrest, President Barack Obama called for calm and understanding, urging Americans to \"come together as a nation\" and \"not just think of Ferguson as a particular place, but think of Ferguson as what can happen, as a consequence of an unarmed young man being shot.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice has announced that it will conduct a federal investigation into the Ferguson Police Department's practices. The investigation will focus on patterns of discrimination and excessive force.\n\nThe protests in Ferguson and across the nation highlight the deep-seated tensions between law enforcement and minority communities, and the need for reform and understanding in order to move forward.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Call for Impeachment of President Trump Over Foreign Election Interference Comments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews this week, several Democratic presidential candidates have expressed their support for impeaching President Donald Trump, citing his recent comments about accepting foreign intelligence on his 2020 rivals as grounds for removal from office.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, stated on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Trump's admission of willingness to accept foreign assistance in his 2020 campaign is sufficient reason for impeachment proceedings. O'Rourke argued that the importance of impeachment lies in the president's admission and that the process should begin immediately.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also voiced her support for impeachment, stating that soliciting something of value from a foreign country for campaign purposes is illegal. Klobuchar pointed to Trump's 2016 public urging of Russia to find and publish Hillary Clinton's emails as a similar instance of sending out signals that could potentially lead to foreign election interference.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democratic presidential candidate, called for impeachment hearings in response to Trump's stated willingness to accept a foreign power's help in his 2020 campaign. De Blasio described Trump's assertion that he would not have to call the FBI if a foreign country offered information about an opponent as \"openly treasonous.\" He labeled the interview as \"the last straw\" and urged Congress to begin impeachment hearings, citing the need to reject the notion of a president who openly invites interference in U.S. elections.\n\nWhile the idea of impeachment is popular among Democratic base voters, polls indicate that it does not yet have majority support among the general public. The recent comments from the Democratic candidates raise questions about the party's willingness to uphold norms of governmental behavior, such as the usually bright line between politics and federal prosecutions, that Trump has reportedly shattered.",
    " Title: Justice Department and North Carolina Engage in Legal Battle over Controversial \"Bathroom\" Law\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina have filed dueling lawsuits over the state's controversial House Bill 2, also known as the \"bathroom law.\" The law, which requires transgender individuals to use bathrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate, has sparked a nationwide debate and has been met with criticism from various sectors.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging a \"pattern or practice of employment discrimination on the basis of sex\" against the state. Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated in a press conference that the law created state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals.\n\nGovernor Pat McCrory, in his lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, accused the administration of a \"baseless and blatant overreach\" in trying to get the policy scrapped. McCrory, speaking at his own press conference, urged the court to intervene in the current dispute, stating that Congress should get involved to \"bring clarity\" to federal anti-discrimination provisions.\n\nThe state had faced a DOJ-imposed Monday deadline to respond to its demand that North Carolina either scrap the law or face legal action and risk losing federal funds. The DOJ, in its lawsuit, retained the option of curtailing federal funding to the state Department of Public Safety and University of North Carolina.\n\nThe state law also limits state anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and blocks local governments from establishing their own. The law has been criticized by gay rights groups, and entertainers including Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam have canceled shows. PayPal reversed plans to open a 400-employee operation center in Charlotte, and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans near Raleigh.\n\nNearly 200 corporate leaders from across the country, including Charlotte-based Bank of America, have urged the law's repeal, arguing it's bad for business because it makes recruiting talented employees more difficult.\n\nThe Justice Department, in a letter last Wednesday, stated that the law violates federal civil rights laws. McCrory, in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" said he asked for an extension and was given only until the close of business Monday.\n\nMcCrory, who signed the bill into law in March, said last week that the department seems to be breaking new ground in claiming the North Carolina law violates Civil Rights Act protections against discrimination in education and the workplace. The governor also stated that the expectation that he can change laws is \"unrealistic.\"\n\nThe administration is expected to soon take the bathroom issue further, to ensure that transgender student rights are fully protected under federal law, according to Politico. The move reportedly would be related to a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities, and multiple agencies are expected to be involved.",
    " Title: College Students and Pollsters Weigh In on the Impact of Allegations Against Presidential Candidate Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing allegations against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have sparked a significant debate, particularly on college campuses and among voters. The White House's campaign to combat \"rape culture\" on college campuses has been met with these allegations, which many students and liberals view as a permissive attitude toward sexual assault.\n\nAlex Abbott, a senior at Hampden-Sydney College, an all-male campus in Virginia, expressed shock that Mr. Trump still enjoys relative support despite his comments about women and the allegations against him. However, he noted that many voters have already made up their minds and are unlikely to swing toward his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, solely on the issue of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"The idea that a candidate with a major-party backing has allegations of this nature on his record is vile,\" said Mr. Abbott. He added that the responses to Mr. Trump's behavior from men are either \"I would never do anything like that,\" or \"Every guy does that, and it's not out of the ordinary.\"\n\nSurveys indicate that voters are primarily concerned about the economy and terrorism. However, the negative attention on Mr. Trump's sexual behavior is reportedly hurting him with female voters and independents, according to Republican pollsters. Yet, support for Mrs. Clinton has not significantly increased, suggesting that many Republicans still do not view Mr. Trump as morally unacceptable, at least compared to the Clintons.\n\nAlan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, attributes this phenomenon to what he terms \"negative partisanship.\" He explained, \"We vote against the other party/candidate more than for our own party/candidate, and that is especially true this year for Republicans.\"\n\nDemocrats, such as Jon Robin Baitz, an acclaimed Broadway playwright, also express dismay. His latest work, \"Vicu\u00f1a,\" explores a tailor's relationship with a blustering Trump-like candidate, and will run this fall at the Kirk Douglas Theater in Los Angeles. \"My heart is broken,\" Mr. Baitz said. \"There is, to me, a kind of fundamental American decency, and it's just been lost in the prurient shallowness of the discourse.\"\n\nThe article underscores the divisive nature of the 2016 presidential election, with the allegations against Mr. Trump causing a stir among college students and pollsters alike. The impact of these allegations on the election remains to be seen.",
    " Title: The Clash of Rights: A Discussion on Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a contentious debate that has divided society, the issue of same-sex marriage and the clash with religious freedom has emerged as a significant point of contention. The argument revolves around the question of whether same-sex marriage is a fundamental right or a societal preference, and the implications this has on the traditional rights enshrined in the Constitution, such as freedom of religion, speech, and association.\n\nOn one side, proponents of same-sex marriage argue that it is a fundamental right, a basic human entitlement that should be recognized and protected by law. On the other hand, opponents argue that same-sex marriage is not a right but a preference, and that the push for its legal recognition is an attempt to redefine morality and impose new societal norms.\n\nCritics of same-sex marriage argue that the push for its recognition as a right is an attempt to usurp the authority of rights from God and misapply it to sexual behavior. They claim that same-sex marriage is a new moral \"right\" that is being legislated on others, often through the imposition of liberal judges.\n\nThe question of whether we can legislate morality is a complex one. While it is true that all laws legislate morality in a legal sense, the question is not whether we can legislate morality, but rather \"Whose morality will we legislate?\" Many argue that the current push for same-sex marriage is an attempt to legislate a new morality, one that is at odds with traditional religious beliefs and values.\n\nLiberals argue that they are fighting for tolerance and diversity, but critics argue that they are often the most intolerant, excluding those with differing views and punishing dissenters through intimidation and legal means. This has been seen in the cases of florists, bakers, photographers, and speakers who have been fined or fired for refusing to participate in same-sex weddings due to their religious beliefs.\n\nHomosexual author Andrew Sullivan has expressed revulsion for the intolerance shown by gay activists towards those who oppose same-sex marriage, citing the case of former Mozilla CEO Brandon Eich as an example. Sullivan wrote, \"The whole episode disgusts me \u2013 as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society.\"\n\nThe clash between same-sex marriage and religious liberty is becoming increasingly apparent, with no middle ground in sight. The question of whether one must celebrate same-sex marriage or whether one's religious beliefs prevent them from doing so is a question with no easy answer. As the debate continues, it is important to remember that the rights of freedom of religion, speech, and association are at stake, and that the source of objective moral truth can only be God, the author of Nature's Law.",

Bernie Sanders continues his triumphant march towards the Democratic nomination, following his victories in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the race for the party's presidential nomination is heating up. With crucial battles in South Carolina on Saturday and Super Tuesday on March 3, Sanders' path to the nomination in Milwaukee could be significantly impacted by a few key events.\n\nFirstly, Sanders faces relentless criticism as a self-proclaimed socialist, with concerns that his nomination could lead to a significant defeat in November. However, Sanders has a history of successfully defending his positions, and attacks on him may merely expose his opponents' political desperation.\n\nSecondly, the anticipated endorsement of Joe Biden by Rep. Jim Clyburn, a powerful black politician in South Carolina, could significantly impact the primary, where 60% of the vote is African American. Clyburn warns that nominating a socialist like Sanders could lead to electoral disaster. If Biden cannot beat Sanders in his firewall state, it raises questions about his viability in the race.\n\nBiden also faces competition from billionaire Tom Steyer, who has invested heavily in South Carolina, hired black leaders, and pledged to support reparations for slavery. Steyer's rising support among black voters could divert votes that would otherwise have gone to Biden. For Biden, South Carolina is a do-or-die state.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders is predicting victories in California and Texas, two of the megastates holding primaries on Super Tuesday. He has been gaining in the polls on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even in her home state of Massachusetts.\n\nThe question remains: With Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, Steyer, and Klobuchar\u2014none of whom has beaten Sanders in the popular vote\u2014who can beat a surging Sanders? When and where do they beat him?\n\nMichael Bloomberg, with his vast resources, could potentially buy enough votes to win some states. However, would the other Democratic candidates stand aside to yield the field to Bloomberg, an ex-Republican oligarch, to save their party from Sanders?\n\nThe Democratic establishment is concerned that if the \"moderates\" in the race do not start falling on their swords, dropping out, and joining behind a single candidate to challenge Sanders, they may lose the nomination to Sanders and the election to Trump.\n\nWhile Sanders' chances of becoming president are slim, his chances of winning the nomination and reshaping the Democratic Party are good and have been improving weekly. Sanders' proposed model for the Democratic Party includes Medicare for All, abolition of private health insurance, a Green New Deal, free college tuition, student debt forgiveness, open borders, and a doubling of the minimum wage, among other policies.\n\nAs Winston Churchill once observed, \"Some regard private enterprise as if it were a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look upon it as a cow that they can milk. Only a handful see it for what it really is\u2014the strong horse that pulls the whole cart.\" Sanders sees free market capitalism as a force to be harnessed and directed, rather than a beast to be tamed or milked.\n\nSanders' message resonates most strongly with the young. Welcome to the Party of JFK, as reconceived by Bernie Sanders.",
    " Title: New Snowden Leaks Reveal Details of NSA's Wide-Reaching Surveillance Program XKeyscore\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fresh wave of revelations, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden has leaked documents detailing the existence of a surveillance program known as XKeyscore. The program, described as the NSA's \"widest-reaching\" in the leaked documents, allows NSA analysts to search through vast databases of emails, chats, and browsing histories from millions of people without prior authorization.\n\nIn a June 10 video, Snowden stated that as an NSA agent, he had the ability to \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.\" Intelligence officials have disputed this claim, but the leaked documents on XKeyscore seem to provide more details on what Snowden was referring to.\n\nThe documents, which the Guardian published Wednesday, are training manuals for XKeyscore and detail how the NSA can mine enormous databases by filling out a simple on-screen form. The request doesn't undergo any court review or need clearance from higher-ranking NSA officials. According to one document, the XKeyscore search can cover \"nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet,\" and even monitor a person's online activity in real-time.\n\nIt's not just metadata that the analysts can see. XKeyscore allows the NSA access to the content of emails and chats. XKeyscore can search by name, telephone number, IP address, and keywords. It does not require a warrant, nor does the person performing the search require legal authority.\n\nXKeyscore can also monitor activity on social media. Using the same tool that allows an NSA analyst to read the contents of stored emails, XKeyscore can read the content of Facebook chats and other private messages. An NSA analyst simply needs to input a Facebook user name and date range into a XKeyscore search.\n\nThe NSA seems to believe that the system is worth it. It claimed in one document that it had captured 200 terrorists with XKeyscore by 2008. One slide indicated that XKeyscore can search HTTP activity with a keyword, allowing the NSA to monitor \"nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet.\"\n\nThe Guardian published the documents the same day that senior intelligence officials met with members of the Senate to release classified documents about the collection of phone records, PRISM, and the FISA court. The revelations add to the ongoing debate about privacy and surveillance in the digital age.",
    " Title: Trump's Iowa Veterans Fundraiser: Only Half of Promised Donations Reached Charities, Report Suggests\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than two months after Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump claimed to have raised $6 million for veterans' charities at a fundraiser held on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have received less than half of that amount, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report, citing a survey of the 22 groups listed by Trump's campaign as prospective recipients for the money, revealed that 19 organizations had obtained a total of $2.4 million from Trump's foundation or associates. Of the three other charities, one declined to disclose how much it had received, another said it needed to submit more paperwork before receiving any money, and the third did not respond to questions by the Journal.\n\nFox Business Network first reported in late February that only a fraction of the pledged donations had made their way to the veterans groups. At the time, several groups said they had not received any money. And seven of the 22 told Fox Business Network they had received a total of $650,000. Other groups did not respond to inquiries at the time.\n\nTrump held the Jan. 29 benefit in lieu of attending a GOP debate hosted by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The real estate mogul had declined to appear at the debate, claiming that he had not been treated fairly by the network.\n\nAll 19 groups that confirmed receiving money from the Trump event got checks in the mail. Sixteen charities saw donations arrive in late February in increments of $50,000 or $100,000. The other three reported smaller donations in March, with those amounts averaging between $5,000 and $15,000.\n\nKeith David of the Task Force Dagger Foundation told the Journal that he was confused about whether a $50,000 check from Trump associate Stewart Rahr's foundation was tied to the Iowa event. He said he had been informed by a Trump representative that it was. \"It's a little weird,\" David said. \"It looks like it's from a totally separate organization.\"\n\nHope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, told The Wall Street Journal that Trump has in fact \"given to the 22 groups we originally announced and many others.\"\n\n\"Additionally, we are continuing to distribute the money raised as it comes in and we are expanding the list of groups receiving contributions,\" she said in a statement. \"If the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our Veterans have been so mistreated, rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump\u2019s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation, we would all be better for it. He has raised millions of dollars for the Vets, and rather than being thanked, he is attacked. As Mr. Trump said, \u2018No good deed goes unpunished.\u2019\"\n\nShe did not say how much money raised at the event had been distributed, or how much each group has received.\n\nThe Journal, citing the Trump Foundation's tax returns, reported that the nonprofit had given just $180,000 to veterans' charities over the past decade. Hicks said that amount did not include personal donations by the candidate.\n\nAt least one prominent charity, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), declined to receive any money from the January fundraiser. IAVA founder Paul Rieckhoff called the event a \"political stunt.\"",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Remains Cryptic on Obama's Deportation Policy for Undocumented Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to President Obama's recent executive order on immigration, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, has declined to disclose his stance on potentially reversing the policy should he assume the presidency. During the Republican primary debates, Romney expressed his intention to veto the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants. However, his stance on Obama's executive order has been more ambiguous.\n\nThe order, issued last week, allows work permits and prevents deportation for as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Romney expressed sympathy for these individuals, stating, \"With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including Romney, have criticized the president for bypassing Congress with the executive order, a move they deem as politically motivated. Romney echoed this sentiment, stating, \"If he felt seriously about this, he should have taken action when he had a Democratic House and Senate, but he didn't.\"\n\nThe president's immigration policies have been a source of concern among Hispanics, a significant voting bloc. In an attempt to address this, Obama supported the passage of the Dream Act in 2010, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nIn an effort to pre-empt Romney's potential immigration policy, Obama may have unveiled a Republican alternative to the Dream Act, proposed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which offers work visas to some immigrants but not a path to citizenship.\n\nAdvisers to Romney have hinted at the unveiling of immigration policies during his speech to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Florida on Thursday. Ana Navarro, an adviser on Hispanic issues to Senator John McCain in 2008, tweeted on Sunday, \"After Obama move, it's time. Romney NALEO speech Thurs is I-Day.\"\n\nIn the interview, Romney also addressed the European economic crisis, stating that the United States should not send checks to Europe or bail out European banks. He emphasized the need to strengthen the U.S. economy and criticized the president's policies for hindering economic growth.\n\nRegarding the ongoing debate about a potential third round of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, Romney expressed skepticism. He reiterated his economic proposals from the primary season, including lowering tax rates and reducing government spending to 20 percent of the economy, which he claims would stimulate growth.\n\nWhen pressed to specify which tax deductions and exemptions he would cut to maintain the progressivity of the tax code, Romney stated, \"Well, we'll go through that process with Congress.\"\n\nRomney is currently in the midst of a six-state bus tour aimed at connecting with everyday Americans. The interview also touched on a lighter note, with Romney joking about his wife, Ann Romney, and her success with their dressage horse, Rafalca, which won a berth on the United States Olympic team.",
    " Title: Investigative Analysis: The Unraveling of the Benghazi 'Spontaneous Protest' Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent revelations from the testimony under oath regarding the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, have cast a shadow of doubt over the official narrative that was presented to the American public last year. The story of a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islamic video, which escalated out of control, has been exposed as a fabrication, originating not in Libya but in Washington.\n\nInitially, the Obama administration maintained that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was a result of a protest demonstration. However, this narrative was never corroborated by the Americans on duty in Libya during the attack, nor by the Libyan government. The highest-ranking American diplomat on the scene in Libya, in direct contact with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reported the incident as a terrorist attack.\n\nThe Libyan president also announced the attack as a terrorist attack, and the C.I.A. informed the Obama administration that it was a terrorist attack. The administration's subsequent claim that this was the best information available at the time from intelligence sources is now questionable, in light of the 12 drafts of the Obama administration's talking points about Benghazi that have since emerged.\n\nThese drafts show that the State Department pressured the intelligence services to omit their clear and unequivocal statement that this was a terrorist attack from the talking points. Attempts to portray Ambassador Susan Rice's false story about a \"spontaneous protest\" as a result of her not having accurate information from the intelligence services have now been exposed as a second lie to justify the first.\n\nThe question of why the Obama administration chose to mislead the American people, potentially for political gain, remains a subject of ongoing investigation. The difference between an honest mistake and a calculated lie to deceive the American public, in order to influence an election, is significant.\n\nThe Obama administration's election campaign had emphasized the death of Osama bin Laden as an accomplishment of the administration, as part of a broader narrative of the defeat of Al-Qaeda and other terrorists. Admitting that these terrorists were still active and capable of carrying out a well-coordinated attack such as the one in Benghazi would have been politically damaging during the election campaign.\n\nThe problem with telling a lie, or a series of lies, is that even a small dose of truth can sometimes cause the entire narrative to collapse. The State Department's own foreign service officer, Gregory Hicks, was in Libya during the attack and knew the truth. When attempts to silence him through negative job evaluations and demotions failed, he was discredited.\n\nThe Obama administration's explanation for not providing aid to the Americans under attack in Benghazi - that it would take too long - is questionable. A small fighting unit in Tripoli was ready to deploy to Benghazi, but was ordered to \"stand down.\" Other units, designed for rapid deployment, were not mobilized. The order to \"stand down\" and the reasons behind it are still under investigation.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how many more revelations will emerge and how they will impact the narrative of the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.",
    " Title: Rising Star in Political Commentary: Kayleigh McEnany's Journey from Bible Teacher to Conservative Commentator\n\nArticle:\n\nKayleigh McEnany, the current White House Press Secretary, has had an intriguing journey that began as a Bible teacher and evolved into a prominent conservative commentator. Her story is one of intellectual growth, faith, and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nDuring her time at Oxford, McEnany found herself in the minority, facing intellectual challenges to her faith. The late Christian pastor Ravi Zacharias served as a guiding influence, bridging the gap between her heart and mind. Zacharias, an apologist, provided her with the intellectual foundation to defend her beliefs, a skill she would later employ in her career.\n\nMcEnany's political career took off when she caught the eye of Alan Colmes, Sean Hannity's liberal counterpart on the program Hannity & Colmes. Colmes' mentorship led to an internship on his show, and the two engaged in fierce political debates. McEnany's ability to argue passionately without alienating others was a key factor in her ascension in the cable-news world.\n\nPost-graduation, McEnany worked as a producer for Mike Huckabee's Fox News show. Her blog, \"Defending Reagan Conservatism,\" reflected her political views, favoring publications like The Economist and displaying a righteous tone. Her political commentary was not without controversy; her tweets occasionally veered towards Trump-style birtherism. Despite this, McEnany remained devout, regularly attending church and engaging with the conservative community on Twitter.\n\nElie Mystal, a writer at The Nation, recalls debating McEnany on various political issues before his appearances on Huckabee's show. Despite their differences, he acknowledges their debates were conducted honorably. Their friendship led to McEnany's position at Above the Law, a legal blog where Mystal was writing at the time. McEnany, who filled the token conservative slot on the mostly liberal website, was described by Mystal as a true believer in her arguments, authentic in her convictions.\n\nMcEnany's career trajectory demonstrates a blend of personal conviction and strategic positioning. Her journey from Bible teacher to White House Press Secretary is a testament to her intellectual prowess, unwavering faith, and ability to engage in robust political discourse.",
    " Title: The Data-Driven Strategy of Donald Trump: A Game-Changer in the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous 2016 presidential race, one candidate stands out for his unconventional approach and polarizing rhetoric: Donald Trump. Despite the widespread criticism and contempt he has generated since his campaign announcement in June, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll places him as the frontrunner with 35 percent of the Republican vote, more than double the 16 percent of runner-up Ted Cruz. This unexpected lead has led many to question Trump's intelligence, but a closer look at his data-driven strategy reveals a shrewd and strategic candidate.\n\nThe upcoming Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary are fast approaching, but two months in American politics can be an eternity. The political landscape can change dramatically in a matter of weeks, and this volatility underscores the importance of understanding the data that drives public sentiment. In this regard, Trump is a gold mine of data that his opponents should be analyzing to understand what resonates with voters and what does not.\n\nTrump's social media presence, particularly on Twitter and Instagram, generates a vast amount of data daily. His provocative statements and responses create a trove of information that can be captured, analyzed, and used to gain insights into voter preferences and behaviors. The Washington Post recently reported that Trump uses his Instagram account and Twitter to deliver snarky messages and short videos, with over 6,000 tweets since launching his campaign in June. This data can be harnessed by his opponents to understand what people like or dislike and why.\n\nPolitics is increasingly becoming a data-driven field, and Trump is generating more data in a day than all other candidates combined in a week. However, every time he says something controversial, he creates data that can be used against him. The key for Trump's opponents is to focus on understanding the reactions to his statements rather than the statements themselves. By analyzing the data generated by Trump's supporters, opponents can learn about their preferences, beliefs, and motivations, and then tailor their messages to appeal to these voters.\n\nThe power of data analysis in politics is not a new concept. President Barack Obama is often cited as a master of using data to win elections. In the 2012 election, his campaign used data to identify undecided voters, learn everything about them, and then persuade them to vote for him in the final days of the campaign. Jim Messina, who headed Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, stated that \"Every night for 18 months, we did 66,000 computer simulations of the election, and that's how we based our tactics... We based it all on big data.\"\n\nTrump understands this power of data and has brought it to the presidential race. He is shaking up the electorate, forcing them to react. While his rhetoric may be divisive, it is undeniable that it is working. He has been at the top of the polls for months. However, this opens an opportunity for his opponents. A savvy opponent, instead of jumping on what Trump is saying, should be jumping on how people are reacting to what he's saying. The data generated by Trump's supporters can be used to understand their preferences, beliefs, and motivations, and then tailor messages to appeal to these voters.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's data-driven strategy is a game-changer in the 2016 presidential race. To beat him, an opponent must be smart enough to move away from the chorus of critics and use the data he's generating to defeat him. Keep your base, analyze the data, and win over his supporters, and the White House will be yours. The time to make this investment is now, as the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary approach.",
    " Title: Shift in U.S. Tax Code Favors Renewable Energy Over Fossil Fuels\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past decade, the U.S. tax code has seen a significant shift in favor of renewable energy sources, with tax preferences for wind, solar, and other renewable fuels surpassing those for oil, gas, and coal. According to data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), renewable energy received $10.9 billion in tax preferences in 2016, compared to $4.6 billion for fossil fuels. A decade ago, fossil fuels received $8.2 billion while renewables pulled in only $5.3 billion in tax preferences.\n\nThe change began in the early days of the Obama administration, with the massive American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and increased production in the wind and solar power sectors shifting tax preferences toward renewable energy. From 2008 to 2009, tax preferences for green fuels jumped by nearly $10 billion, from $7.4 billion to $17.1 billion. At the same time, tax preferences for fossil fuels decreased from $5.5 billion in 2008 to $3.6 billion in 2009.\n\nWhile the gap has narrowed since then, it still highlights a tilt in the current tax code towards renewable fuels. The latest CBO figures come against the backdrop of a broader debate about tax reform, with President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress eager to rewrite the tax code, shrink rates, and eliminate deductions. However, specialists say they will have an uphill battle to strip all of the energy carve-outs that have been implemented over the past decade.\n\n\"I think it's pretty difficult. Look at the wind production tax credit - it keeps getting extended because there are a bunch of Republican senators from wind states,\" said Benjamin Zycher, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in energy and environmental policy. \"It's supposed to be phased out, but we'll see. I have my doubts. It's difficult to get rid of these things.\"\n\nIndeed, tax credits for the production of wind power have been routinely extended by Congress, though they're currently being phased out and are scheduled to end by 2019. These tax credits, along with other tax preferences for solar power and other renewable sources, accounted for more than $6 billion in tax preferences last year, according to CBO numbers. Another $4.2 billion went to biodiesel and renewable diesel credits, the CBO said.\n\nSpecialists routinely point out that much of the tax preferences have come about because of increased production in renewable energy, not just because of the establishment of new government policies favoring a given source. The shift has been the result of tax policies and changes within the energy industry itself.\n\nThe wind production tax credit, for example, was first enacted in 1992. The following year, renewable energy received just $900 million in tax preferences, compared to $2 billion for fossil fuels. The tax credits have become more valuable in terms of dollar amounts simply because of the wind industry's expansion and significant increases in production, analysts say.\n\n\"These tax expenditures don't represent a shift - there have been no changes in the tax provisions that deliver fossil fuel tax expenditures over the past decade - but an increase in the renewable power investment and output that qualifies for the renewable tax expenditures,\" said Joseph Aldy, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School who studies energy and tax policy.\n\nAdditional government investment and preferential treatment through the tax code has spurred that production even more, creating a cycle. From 2007 to 2014, for example, wind capacity in the U.S. nearly quadrupled. On the fossil fuels side, many of the tax-preference policies have been in place for decades.\n\nIn 2016, the sector received $1.8 billion in tax preferences for the \"expensing of exploration and development costs for oil and natural gas,\" the CBO said, along with billions of dollars in benefits for the depreciation of gas distribution lines, \"geological and geophysical expenditures\" related to exploration, and other activities.\n\nLeading lawmakers, in theory, say they want to eliminate many of those tax preference schemes while lowering the broader tax rates for all businesses. Such a huge overhaul of the tax code will be politically difficult and incredibly complicated, but GOP leaders have the support of President Trump, and the president seems especially interested in pushing through a tax-reform package following the failure to repeal Obamacare earlier this year.",
    " Title: Pope Francis: A Humble and Unconventional Leader Honoring St. Francis of Assisi\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, the first Latin American and Jesuit pope, has taken the name of St. Francis of Assisi, a move that signifies his admiration for the saint's dedication to the poor and nature. Born in Argentina, Francis is not the first non-European pope, as some may believe. In fact, popes from Syria, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and modern-day Libya have held the position in the past.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Pope Francis is known for his humility and simplicity. He has chosen to live in an apartment instead of the archbishop's palace, eschewing a chauffeured limousine and cooking his own meals. In his first public act as pontiff, he broke with tradition by asking the crowd to pray for him, rather than blessing them.\n\nIn his first public address, Pope Francis emphasized his desire for a church that is \"poor and for the poor.\" He has been praised for his care for AIDS patients and single mothers, and for his opposition to the exclusion of these individuals from the church.\n\nFrancis's career as a priest in Argentina coincided with the Dirty War, a period of political repression and human rights abuses. He has been accused of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, but these accusations have been disputed.\n\nPope Francis takes the helm of a church that has been rocked by sex abuse scandals and allegations of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. He may need to find a way to draw new Catholics into the church, where it is in decline, and to navigate shifting viewpoints among Catholics on issues such as contraception and immigration.\n\nAs a cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. He has also been criticized for the church's response to the Dirty War, during which as many as 30,000 people died or disappeared.\n\nDespite these challenges, Pope Francis's humility, simplicity, and dedication to the poor have won him widespread admiration and support from Catholics worldwide. His papacy is expected to bring a fresh perspective and a renewed focus on social justice to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.",
    " Title: McConnell Defends Vote to Raise Debt Ceiling, Faces Criticism from Primary Opponents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign appearance in Louisville, Kentucky on Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) defended his decision to join Democrats in a vote to clear a filibuster hurdle that allowed a vote to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nMcConnell, who was one of 12 Republican senators to join Democrats on Tuesday, said, \"My job is to protect the country when I can and to step up and lead on those occasions when it's required. That's what I did.\"\n\nThe vote, which will extend the federal debt limit for a year, has been met with criticism from some of McConnell's opponents, including Matt Bevin, a tea party conservative who is challenging McConnell in the Kentucky GOP primary in May. Bevin said in a statement after the vote, \"Kentucky and America can literally no longer afford such financially reckless behavior from the likes of Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who threatened to filibuster the vote, also criticized Senate Republicans for joining with Democrats to vote for the bill. Cruz said, \"Every Senate Republican should have stood together.\"\n\nWhen asked about his opponents' comments, McConnell defended his position, saying, \"My preference is for a debt ceiling to carry additional legislation that does something about the debt.\"\n\nMcConnell also defended his record as a legislator who averts crises, citing his role in the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012 and the 16th day of the government shutdown in October 2013.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, after unsuccessfully trying to gather enough Republicans to vote on a new version of the bill, joked on February 6th, \"You know, Mother Teresa is a saint now, but if the Congress wanted to make her a saint and attach that to the debt ceiling, you probably couldn't get 218 Republican votes.\"\n\nMcConnell's opponents, including Bevin and Cruz, have accused him of giving President Obama a \"blank check\" by voting for the clean debt-ceiling bill. McConnell responded to these criticisms on Friday, saying, \"The Speaker tried a whole lot of different versions, add-ons to the debt ceiling. He could not get to 218 no matter what combination.\"",
    " Title: David Gergen Praises Bill Clinton's Rousing DNC Speech, Highlights President Obama's Challenges Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a successful Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Charlotte, political analyst David Gergen has commended former President Bill Clinton for his impactful speech, which added strength to an already rousing convention. Clinton was particularly effective in attacking the Romney-Ryan budget plan, according to Gergen.\n\nGergen emphasized that the onus is now on President Obama to make a strong case for his re-election, with Thursday's speech being a crucial opportunity for him to explain why a second term would be better. The convention, which has been well-choreographed and boasted a string of successful speeches, has revived Democratic spirits, as the roars in the hall have made it clear that the party has regained its fighting mood, newly confident they can retain the White House.\n\nMichelle Obama's speech on Tuesday night was also highly praised, as she delivered a fresh and inspiring testimonial on behalf of her husband despite his well-known persona. Bill Clinton's speech on Wednesday was equally effective, if not more so, and has been hailed as the best and most influential he has given since leaving the White House a dozen years ago.\n\nClinton's speech was instrumental in telling the story of Obama's stewardship better than Obama has ever done and in exposing the vulnerable holes in the Romney-Ryan budget plan. Thoughtful Republicans have expressed concerns that Democrats may be able to turn GOP plans into a potent weapon for peeling away older voters as well as others; those fears have been validated, according to Gergen.\n\nHowever, even Clinton and Michelle Obama together, joined by many other forceful speakers, are not enough to close the final deal. Ultimately, Barack Obama is the only one who can do that. The challenges facing Obama Thursday include maintaining audience engagement, as his audiences have been shrinking, and presenting a compelling plan to address the economic crisis.\n\nObama's biggest test is to convince wavering voters that he can make the next four years better than the past four. The electorate is less likely to be persuaded by half-measures and bland assurances, and they want a road map that comes with some details. The success of Thursday's speech will rest on more than soaring rhetoric.",
    " Title: Edward Snowden Reveals Concerns Over U.S. Cyberterrorism Program \"MonsterMind\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Wired magazine, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden has revealed that the development of a U.S. counterattack program for cyberterrorism, known as \"MonsterMind,\" was a significant factor in his decision to leak government secrets.\n\nSnowden, who is photographed for the story with an American flag, described MonsterMind as a program designed to detect and prevent foreign cyberattacks. However, he expressed concern that the program, which automatically fires back in response to detected attacks, could potentially harm innocent third-party countries.\n\n\"These attacks can be spoofed,\" Snowden told Wired. \"You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?\"\n\nAt 31 years old, Snowden also expressed his hope to return to the U.S. someday. \"I told the government I'd volunteer for prison, as long as it served the right purpose,\" he said. \"I care more about the country than what happens to me. But we can't allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I'm not going to be part of that.\"\n\nSnowden leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June 2013, setting off a global firestorm. He was in hiding in Hong Kong at the time and later fled to Moscow where he still resides.\n\nPresident Obama promised to scale back surveillance of American citizens, and Germany ordered the CIA station chief out of the country. The Guardian and Post won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for their coverage.\n\nSnowden has previously expressed interest in returning to the United States, but has expressed concerns about an unjust trial on charges of espionage and theft of government property, which could result in a lengthy prison sentence. He remains adamant that what he did was for the good of the country.\n\nSnowden told Wired that MonsterMind, for example, could potentially start a war and poses a significant threat to privacy because it requires the NSA to gain access to virtually all private communications coming in from overseas.\n\n\"The argument is that the only way we can identify these malicious traffic flows and respond to them is if we're analyzing all traffic flows,\" he said. \"And if we're analyzing all traffic flows, that means we have to be intercepting all traffic flows. That means violating the Fourth Amendment, seizing private communications without a warrant, without probable cause or even a suspicion of wrongdoing.

    " Title: President Obama Urges Congress to Expedite Immigration Reform as Bipartisan Bill Nears Completion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a naturalization ceremony at the White House on Monday, President Barack Obama called on Congress to accelerate efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform, emphasizing the need for political courage to address the nation's long-standing immigration issues.\n\nDuring the ceremony for 28 new U.S. citizens in the East Room, the President stated, \"The time has come to fix it once and for all.\" He urged Congress to \"work up the political courage to do what\u2019s required to be done\" as they continue to draft legislation that is expected to be introduced next month.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators is currently working on a proposal that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants while allowing for the entry of tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers. The bill would also increase the number of visas for high-tech workers, introduce a new guest-worker program, and eliminate certain categories of visas for extended family members.\n\nOne of the contentious issues in the bill is the wages for lower-skilled temporary workers, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO opposing on this point. The proposal suggests granting visas to as many as 200,000 immigrants each year for low-skilled jobs that U.S. employers find difficult to fill.\n\nIn the House, Speaker John A. Boehner has indicated that a bipartisan bill could be introduced in the coming weeks.\n\nPresident Obama described the progress as \"good news,\" but emphasized the need for Congress to complete its work promptly. \"I expect the debate to begin next month,\" he said, \"I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe legislation will call for increased border control, although U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently informed lawmakers that it lacks a method to effectively measure border security.\n\nNot all powerful lawmakers are in favor of the \"speedy bill\" approach advocated by President Obama and Capitol Hill leaders. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and five other Republican senators have requested more hearings and time to study before any bill is rushed through the Judiciary Committee. They pointed out that 43 new senators have joined the chamber since 2007, when the last major congressional push on immigration occurred.\n\nWhile the issue has historically divided both parties and their constituents, Democrats are increasingly united behind President Obama's push. However, Republicans are split between concerns about border security and a desire to win over Hispanic voters, who have been hesitant to support GOP presidential candidates in the past two elections.\n\nPresident Obama has made immigration a top priority of his second term, fulfilling a long-standing promise to Hispanic voters. The renewed focus on immigration reform since the November elections also reflects Republican lawmakers' concerns about Hispanics' growing support for Democratic candidates and the perception among Hispanics that the GOP is anti-immigration.\n\nThirteen of the people who took the oath of citizenship at the White House are members of the U.S. military. The President praised them for their \"willingness to risk their lives in defense of a nation that was not yet their own.\" He added, \"That's a remarkable act. It made each of them in some ways American even before it was official, because that kind of service and sacrifice has defined our nation for more than two centuries.\"",
    " Title: Asian-American Vote Emerges as New Battleground in U.S. Congressional Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a contentious national election marked by geopolitical instability and a heated immigration debate, an unexpected set of issues has arisen in the race for control of Congress: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, maritime disputes between Japan and the Republic of Korea, and other unconventional topics related to the Asian-American community. These issues are particularly prominent in the suburbs of Fairfax, Virginia, a few miles from the nation's capital, where candidates are vying for the support of the area's rapidly growing Asian-American population.\n\nAt a recent event hosted by minority-led business groups, Congressman Gerry Connolly addressed the crowd in several languages, including Korean, Chinese, and Thai. Former Lt. Gov. Don Beyer, running for Congress in a nearby district, highlighted the number of foreign-born employees at his eponymous Volvo dealerships. Republican state Del. Barbara Comstock, a contender for the open 10th District House seat, emphasized her support for legislation mandating that textbooks refer to the Sea of Japan as the East Sea, a name favored by Koreans.\n\nNonpartisan voter turnout leaflets emphasized the importance of participating in the democratic process, recalling the specters of World War II-era Japanese internment and racially restrictive, 19th-century immigration rules.\n\nFairfax is just one of a growing list of urban and suburban battlegrounds, including northern New Jersey, the greater Atlanta area, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, and the West Coast, where both major parties have intensified their focus on Asian-American voters this year.\n\nThe renewed interest in the Asian-American community stems from President Barack Obama's landslide victory among Asian-American voters in 2012 and new government data showing Asians outpacing Latinos as the fastest-growing immigrant population. Prominent elected officials from both parties have called for a more targeted approach to engaging with Asian-American voters.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, whose campaign has run TV ads in Vietnamese and offers versions of its website in Mandarin and Hindi, stated that it is crucial for the GOP to \"show up\" before these communities' distrust of Republicans becomes entrenched. California Rep. Judy Chu, the Democrat who leads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, noted that both parties increasingly view Asian Americans as a \"margin of victory\" population in some particularly challenging races.\n\nWhile pollsters caution against generalizing about Asian-American voters due to the vast diversity within the population, partisan strategists and Asian-American activists agree that there are common concerns across culturally disparate immigrant groups, such as a strong focus on education and the economic environment for small, family-owned businesses. There is also a growing affinity for the Democratic Party, which is perceived as the party that supports racial and ethnic diversity and a more inclusive federal immigration policy.\n\nIn 2012, Asian Americans voted for the president by a margin of 47 points, even more than Latinos. In swing-state Virginia, where Asian Americans made up 3% of the electorate, they supported Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine by 32 points. In 2010, in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's close reelection fight, Asian voters were 4% of the Nevada electorate, and nearly four in five supported the embattled incumbent.",
    " Title: FBI Releases Hundreds of Pages of Court Records Detailing Early Stages of Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a significant development, the FBI has released over 400 pages of material filed with a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to request a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide who investigators believed was collaborating with Moscow. The documents provide new detail about the early phases of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\nThe documents, which were redacted in vast portions, offer insight into the FBI's approach during the initial stages of the investigation. They also fueled a partisan debate over the extent to which the FBI's evidence was based on the work of a former British intelligence officer with ties to Hillary Clinton.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies, including Republican lawmakers, focused on the fact that the agent's controversial \"dossier\" alleging links between Russia and Trump's campaign formed part of the evidence investigators used to obtain a wiretap on Page. The British agent, Christopher Steele, was hired by a research firm working for Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said anyone reading the documents could \"see the amount of reliance they placed on this product funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, the president blasted his Justice Department, arguing that the documents pointed to an \"illegal scam\" perpetrated by the FBI. \"As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted,\" Trump wrote, \"but confirm with little doubt that the Department of 'Justice' and FBI misled the courts.\"\n\nThe president's reaction put him at odds with senior members of his own Justice Department. The documents show that two requests to extend the surveillance of Page were approved by his appointees in the department, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans noted that the FBI disclosed in their filings that Steele \"was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\" Trump's campaign. Despite that fact, investigators said they believed \u2013 based on previous interactions with Steele \u2013 that his report was credible.\n\nThe applications also suggest the FBI had broader suspicions about Page and his potential ties to the Russian government.\n\n\"It was a solid application and renewals signed by four different judges,\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he did not see any indication in the court records that the Justice Department had done anything wrong.\n\n\"They went to the court. They got the judges to approve it,\" Rubio said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"And there was a lot of reasons unrelated to the dossier for why they wanted to look at Carter Page.\"\n\nFour federal judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, approved the surveillance requests, each finding the government had shown \"probable cause\" that Page was acting as an agent of Russia.\n\nPage, a former campaign aide to Trump, denied Sunday that he collaborated with the Russian government to interfere with the election. Speaking for the first time since the documents were made public, Page told CNN the allegations were \"a complete joke.\" Page has not been charged with a crime, despite the extended surveillance.\n\n\"This is so ridiculous,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve never been an agent of a foreign power.\"\n\nPressed by CNN's Jake Tapper about previous remarks in which he described himself as an \"informal adviser\" to Russia, Page dismissed his role.\n\nThe FBI began monitoring Page in October 2016. That surveillance was carried out under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the government to monitor communications when it can persuade a judge that someone is working as an agent of a foreign power. The documents show the surveillance continued last year.\n\nInvestigators said that they had collected evidence that \"the Russian Government\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election were being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with\" Trump's campaign.\n\n\"Totally false,\" Page said on CNN. \"I might have participated in a few meetings. It\u2019s really spin.\"\n\nThe documents were made public after a week in which the White House was repeatedly forced to walk back comments Trump made about Russia, including during a joint appearance with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.\n\nDuring a joint news conference last week, Trump appeared to accept Putin's denial of Russia's attempt to influence the election, but later clarified he thought Moscow was involved. The White House then clarified that Trump believes Russia is still attempting to target U.S. elections after the president appeared to answer a reporter's question hours earlier saying Russia is not.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the James Madison Project, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government accountability, filed a lawsuit last year under the Freedom of Information Act seeking records about surveillance of Trump's campaign. The suit came after Trump claimed the Obama administration \"wire-tapped\" Trump Tower before the election.\n\nMore: Justice Department says it's considering public disclosure of Carter Page surveillance order\nMore: Who is former Trump adviser Carter Page and why is he at the center of the Nunes memo?",
    " Title: President Trump Promotes 'Fair Trade' Agenda at Davos, Urges Global Investment in U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump, during his inaugural address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday, emphasized his commitment to promoting \"fair trade\" rather than protectionism, a shift from his campaign's \"America First\" policy.\n\nTrump stated, \"I'm here to deliver a simple message - there has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again.\"\n\nThe President lauded the economic achievements of his first year in office, including cutting corporation tax and lowering the unemployment rate. He urged foreign investors to \"bring your money, your jobs, your businesses to America.\"\n\nDespite the slowdown in US economic growth from 3.2% to 2.6% in the final quarter of last year, Trump's speech was well-received, with cheers on his arrival on Thursday in the main Congress Centre.\n\nIn his speech, Trump also addressed the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines, a move that has caused concern for countries like South Korea. He demanded a reformed international trade system that was \"fair and reciprocal\" and accused unidentified countries of unfair practices, including \"massive intellectual property theft\" and providing state aid to industry.\n\nTrump also expressed a preference for bilateral fair trade agreements with other countries, including those signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) from which he has withdrawn. He suggested he would consider negotiating with TPP states collectively, if it was in America's interest.\n\nIn a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May the same day, Trump said he expected \"a tremendous increase\" in trade between the US and Britain in the coming years. He also expressed a willingness to apologize for retweeting posts from a British far-right group last November, a move that sparked a Twitter row with May.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, also in Davos, has warned of \"more to come\" on trade tariffs. The President's speech comes days after the US announced new tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines and solar panels, prompting an outcry from China and South Korea - the primary targets of the measure.",
    " Title: A Proposed Republican Response to School Shootings: A Call for Common Sense Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the tragic shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead and several more injured, President Barack Obama has announced his intention to issue executive orders to expand background checks for gun buyers. The shooting has reportedly prompted the President to take action, as he feels that the public may be near a tipping point and his own time in office is slipping by without any progress on this issue.\n\nThe Republican response to this issue has been mainly defensive, with many members of the party focusing on defending against the onslaught of progressives who want more gun control and a reduction of guns in the country. However, it is maddening to watch them bumble and stumble around with no real response to the seemingly growing number of mass shootings in schools except to try and absorb the blows from the gun control advocates and hope that the wave of emotions passes without any real damage.\n\nEnough is enough. The Republicans need an actual plan to reduce these shootings and need to take the offensive rather than being backed into a corner and hit with body shots again and again. Here are four ideas that address the issue of mass shootings without conceding the false argument that guns are the issue and they need to be regulated even more.\n\nFirst, federal minimum sentences for gun crimes already exist when someone is convicted of a federal felony involving violence or drug trafficking. However, this broad-brush approach lumps in people who have legally purchased a gun and those who have acquired it through other means (read: illegally). This should be changed so that the minimum sentences are reduced if the gun is legally owned, but maintained or even increased if it was illegally acquired. This separates legal gun ownership from illegal ownership, a much-needed differentiation in a time where the two often get lumped together.\n\nSecond, a modification to the HIPAA laws could be greatly beneficial to prevent people with severe mental illnesses from purchasing a gun. Currently, there are many states who provide almost no records for individuals who would be prohibited from buying a gun based on mental health reasons. The Privacy Rule in HIPAA creates national standards to protect medical records and the personal health information of patients. The cases in which those records and information are allowed to be shared can be very vague when it comes to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) used to vet a potential gun buyer. Within this rule, there is no explicit permission to share information with the NICS database. This should be corrected so that those who are already legally prohibited from buying a gun are actually stopped should they try to do so. Adding this explicit permission removes any legal questions and gray areas that would have previously prevented states from sharing the pertinent data.\n\nThird, any publicly funded school should install metal detectors at all entrances. I do not believe in forcing every school to comply with this and so I believe it should be an \u201copt-in\u201d plan. Local school boards will have to make the decision in the end, but this gives the parents, students, and employees of the district a very real voice in what that decision is. I do, however, believe a funding mechanism should be in place. Currently, we give out $2.8 billion in \u201cDemocracy, Human Rights and Governance\u201d aid to countries around the world. This is just a small piece of the nearly $34 billion in foreign aid that is planned to be spent. Surely this would be enough to fund any district who chose to secure their schools with metal detectors.\n\nThe other piece to this is that each school will be required to have one frequently trained and tested employee that is armed at all times per 500 students. They will be trained and tested on a regular basis by local police, given a tax-free stipend equal to 5 percent of the average teacher salary for the district, any medical bills incurred while performing their duty will be fully covered, and they will have a life insurance policy equal to double their current salary if they are killed while performing their duty. This, I believe, provides enough incentive for people to volunteer, but not enough that the wrong people step up for the wrong reasons. With about 50.1 million public school students in the country, this equates to just over 100,000 armed volunteers. If that 5 percent stipend averages out to $3,500 per year, it would cost our country just over $350 million. The medical bills and life insurance policies would be negligible due to the fact that shootings are still a rare occurrence at schools. With the above $2.8 billion in play, this would easily be funded.\n\nLast but not least, gun-free zones would be outlawed. The Second Amendment states that the \u201cright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d Unlike the First Amendment, which explicitly applies restrictions to Congress, the Second Amendment simply states that this right shall not be infringed. Period. That means that neither Congress nor any private citizen or business can infringe upon that right. Based on this, gun-free zones would be unconstitutional as they infringe upon an individual\u2019s constitutionally protected rights. Whatever the rationale behind the preference, a business or institution is not allowed to violate someone\u2019s constitutionally protected rights.\n\nTo anyone who would gasp at forcing a business to allow guns in their store in violation of their conscience or preferences, I give you four simple words: Sweet Cakes by Melissa. These four ideas, particularly the last two, address the issue of mass shootings without conceding the false argument that guns are the issue and they need to be regulated even more. None of these ideas expand background checks or create any more restrictions on gun ownership. Rather, they seek to add some real common sense to a difficult issue, help protect those in vulnerable settings, and respect the right of the Second Amendment.\n\nAll that is needed is to find a Republican courageous enough to stick to their guns, advance a set of proposals like this, and not back down. It\u2019s time to stop allowing ourselves to be painted into a defensive corner and to take back the narrative on guns from those who use it to control us.",
    " Title: CNN's Continued Pursuit of Collusion Allegations Despite Mueller Report Findings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the findings of the Mueller report, CNN, a major news network, has persisted in pushing conspiracy theories regarding collusion between President Trump and Russia, despite the Special Counsel's conclusion that no such collusion was found.\n\nOver the past two nights, CNN's prime-time hosts have continued to speculate on the compromising of President Trump or his associates by the Russians. On Monday, host Erin Burnett began her show, OutFront, by forwarding unsubstantiated claims made by California Congressman Adam Schiff (D), who has often claimed to have direct evidence of collusion but was proven incorrect by the Mueller report.\n\nBurnett questioned whether the investigation into potential collusion was still ongoing, despite the Special Counsel's findings. In a conversation with CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz, Burnett seemed unsure if Robert Mueller had ever considered the question of potential compromise. Prokupecz, however, suspected that it was and continued to be a focus of counterintelligence investigations.\n\nEarly in CNN's Tuesday prime-time lineup, analyst Ralph Peters continued to support the debunked Steele dossier, despite Mueller's findings, receiving no pushback from host Anderson Cooper. Later in the evening, Prime Time host Chris Cuomo emphatically asserted that \"collusion is not a crime\" and suggested that evidence for collusion could be found in the full report, despite the summary stating that the Special Counsel did not find any collusion.\n\nDespite the summary's clear statement that \"the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the [Russians] in [their] efforts\u2026\", CNN's relentless pursuit of collusion allegations continues, seemingly disregarding the facts presented in the Mueller report. This raises questions about CNN's commitment to its #FactsFirst mantra.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton to Deliver Foreign Policy Speech Attacking Donald Trump's National Security Plans\n\nIn a significant move, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is set to deliver a major foreign policy speech on Thursday in San Diego, California. The speech aims to draw a clear contrast between Clinton's plans and those proposed by her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.\n\nClinton's campaign has announced that the speech, scheduled for 11.30am local time, will outline why Trump is \"fundamentally unfit\" to be president. The campaign's senior policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, stated that the speech will highlight Trump's policies, including his proposed border wall with Mexico and his temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.\n\nSullivan further explained that the speech will rebuke a series of dangerous policies Trump has advocated, ranging from nuclear proliferation to endorsing war crimes, denouncing NATO to banning Muslims. However, Clinton's critique will extend beyond specific policies, with Sullivan stating that the choice in this election goes beyond partisanship.\n\nClinton's campaign is expecting to secure the final delegates needed to officially become the party's nominee after the California and New Jersey primaries on June 7. Clinton currently has 2,312 delegates, including 543 super delegates, to Bernie Sanders' 1,545 delegates, including 44 super delegates, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn a related development, Clinton did not mention Sanders in a Wednesday night speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey, instead focusing on the newly released documents showing Trump University encouraged staff to target prospective students' financial weakness to enroll them in expensive courses. Clinton described Trump as a \"fraud\" and accused him of trying to \"scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama also delivered a hit on Trump in a speech in Elkhart, Indiana, stating that a Trump presidency would increase the risk of a financial crisis. Obama referred to the Wall Street reforms that Trump has pledged to dismantle.\n\nTrump is also campaigning in California. Speaking in Sacramento on Wednesday night, he responded to Obama's claims by calling the president \"a total lightweight.\"\n\nThis development marks a significant escalation in the rhetoric between the two frontrunners as they campaign in California ahead of the state's primary next week.",
    " Title: The Parallel Evolution of Digital Surveillance and Speech Control in the U.S. and Authoritarian States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, the debate between freedom and control of the internet has been a significant global discourse. A closer examination of the current practices of digital surveillance and speech control in the United States reveals striking similarities to authoritarian states, such as China.\n\nThe recent measures taken by American tech platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic are not an anomaly but rather an acceleration of long-term trends. The United States, despite its constitutional and cultural differences, has been moving towards increased digital surveillance and speech control, with the private sector taking the lead.\n\nThe U.S. government, in collaboration with young tech firms, promoted non-regulation and American-style freedom of speech as essential features of the internet since the 1990s. The assumption was that authoritarian states would crumble in the face of digital networks that seemed to embody American constitutional values. The internet was seen as a vehicle for spreading U.S. civil and political values, with the belief that more speech would lead to better platforms and, ultimately, democratic revolutions worldwide.\n\nHowever, China, concerned about unregulated digital speech, began developing more powerful mechanisms of surveillance and control in the late 1990s. This approach was not only a means to maintain the Communist Party's control but also to preserve the domestic social order. Other authoritarian nations followed China's lead, and in 2009, China, Russia, and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation announced their \"agreement on cooperation in the field of international information security.\" This agreement foresaw a coming \"information war,\" in which internet platforms would be weaponized, posing a threat to nations' \"social and political systems.\"\n\nDuring the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the United States played a role in securing digital freedoms for people living in authoritarian states. It provided resources to support encryption and filter-evasion products designed to help individuals circumvent politically motivated censorship. The U.S. also openly assisted Twitter and other U.S. tech platforms that seemed to be fueling the Arab Spring.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize the shared trajectory of digital surveillance and speech control in both democratic and authoritarian states. The trend towards greater surveillance and speech control, as well as the growing role of governments, is undeniable and likely inexorable. The challenge lies in striking a balance between preserving individual freedoms and maintaining societal norms and values in the digital age.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Women's Rights Advocacy Under Scrutiny as Presidential Bid Looms\n\n Article:\n\n As Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential bid, her record on promoting women's rights around the world is coming under scrutiny. The former Secretary of State's actions during her tenure, as well as foreign funding questions surrounding her family foundation, have raised questions about her connections to regimes that are often unfriendly to women's interests.\n\n Politico reports that Clinton will likely need to provide a better explanation for her friendly relations with governments like Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, where gender inequality is deeply ingrained. This comes as the so-called \"Hillary Doctrine,\" which follows her own words on human rights, stating that the subjugation of women is a threat to global and national security, stands in stark contrast to her interactions with world leaders such as Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of millions in donations from countries like Qatar, Oman, Algeria, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n In those countries, gender inequality is not only prevalent but is a protected way of life. Politico noted that as recently as last week, Clinton defended her record when questions arose about the foundation's donations. She stated, \"There can\u2019t be any mistake about my passion concerning women\u2019s rights here at home and around the world. So I think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what we\u2019re working on.\"\n\n However, others question Clinton's record and are giving it a second look as she prepares to launch her national campaign. Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told Bloomberg, \"What exactly are her grand accomplishments on behalf of women?\" Pletka added, \"I\u2019m really impressed with how she turned around Saudi Arabia. She does not do much more than talk.\"\n\n Other powerful women in the political and business sphere have also raised cold eyebrows to Clinton's contradictions. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, for example, told a Conservative Political Action Conference group in February that Clinton \"tweets about women's rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights.\"\n\n The Clinton family foundation has defended its donations from Middle Eastern countries, with Bill Clinton stating, \"Do we agree with everything they do? No. You\u2019ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\"\n\n As Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign, the scrutiny of her record on women's rights will likely continue to be a topic of discussion and debate.",
    " Title: \" Facebook's Fact-Checking System and the Proposed Transparent Reputation Marker\"\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook's ongoing battle against the spread of fake news has led to the implementation of a system that relies on independent fact-checking organizations to identify false and misleading information. Users who attempt to post such content are presented with a pop-up explaining the issues with the news and asking for confirmation to proceed.\n\nHowever, Facebook's secret monitoring and calculation of users' reliability scores based on their engagement with the fact-checking system has raised concerns about privacy and transparency. In an article published in The Washington Post, it was reported that Facebook calculates scores representing how often users' flags align with the analysis of independent fact-checkers, but these scores are not disclosed to users.\n\nRegina Rini, a philosophy professor at York University in Toronto, has proposed a more transparent system. Instead of calculating secret scores, Facebook should display a simple reliability marker on every post and comment. This marker would indicate a user's propensity to share disputed information after being warned that it might be false or misleading.\n\nRini's proposal involves no censorship. Users would still be able to post whatever they want, but they would have to consider the reliability marker before sharing information. This system aims to assist rather than replace the testimonial norms that have governed information-gathering for centuries.\n\nRini's idea is not just theoretical; it is grounded in existing technology. The solution for fake news, she argues, will not only involve clever programming but also each user's responsibility as a digital citizen and the protection of their epistemic reputation.\n\nRini is the author of \"Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments\" and \"The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,\" with essays from the series, published by Liveright Books.

    " Title: Trump and the Media: A Rocky Relationship Ahead as President-elect Promises Professional Working Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump settles into the White House, the relationship between him and the media is proving to be a challenging one. Distrust and ill feelings are prevalent on both sides, and there is little expectation that the acrimony that characterized the final months of the presidential campaign will dissipate.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Tuesday, Trump offered an olive branch, acknowledging that he is a longtime reader and expressing a willingness to develop a professional working relationship. \"I would like to turn it around,\" Trump said. \"I think it would make the job I am doing much easier.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's words may do little to assuage the press's fears. White House reporters are concerned about access to Trump, who did not allow reporters on his campaign plane and abandoned media staking out Trump Tower last week to have dinner with family at New York's 21 Club. The president-elect's frequent threats to the press have added to a sense that the rules for covering this White House might be different.\n\nJoe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton, said, \"Every incoming president has basic, generally agreed-upon rules of the road. The Trump team has decided they'll blow up the road and build a new one. Where it goes from here will be a test of how far the new president and his team want to push things, and the strength and will of the press to push back.\"\n\nTrump's transition team has committed to having a press pool, which allows for a small group of reporters to remain stationed near the president to document his movements. The pool was on hand for significant events such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, and when George W. Bush was on the move on 9/11.\n\nHowever, there are no laws requiring an administration to maintain a press pool or even grant access to administration officials, news outlets, the briefing room, or White House grounds. During his primary campaign, Trump blackballed some news outlets from covering his rallies, which were open to the public, due to his displeasure with their coverage of him. He also singled out individual reporters for ridicule and whipped up a frenzy against the media at his rallies, where Trump supporters would jeer at the press pen.\n\nTrump has not held a formal press conference\u2014where reporters from a range of media outlets can ask him questions\u2014since July. The Trump campaign once criticized Hillary Clinton for doing the same. But Trump has little incentive to go through traditional media channels, some experts say. Facebook and Twitter combine to give him one of the most powerful social media presences in the world. He has former Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon at his side in the White House, giving him a powerful ally in the massively influential world of right-wing news.\n\nWhen Trump releases a straight-to-camera video to announce his 100-day agenda, as he did this week in lieu of a press conference, it elicits the same volume of coverage as a press conference would. Press advocates are worried that the president-elect appears to be holding all the cards.\n\n\"Over the last 20 to 30 years, each White House has thrown up more obstacles and become more obsessed with controlling their own message,\" said Craig Aaron, president of the advocacy group Free Press. \"But this is a new apex, and it's really dangerous. There used to be basic norms. You have to assume anything is possible now.\"\n\nThe media will likely receive little sympathy from the public, with a favorable rating sitting at an all-time low in the latest Gallup survey. Only 32 percent of Americans say they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the press. Trump's allies believe all their moves to push back against what they view as a hopelessly biased liberal media are justified. They are furious over what they see as a press corps that has dropped any pretense of objectivity in covering Trump, and they are sick of what they view as breathless coverage of frivolous stories, like the \"Hamilton\" actor who chided Vice President-elect Mike Pence after a performance.\n\nTrump allies are apoplectic over the media's obsession with the alt-right and the neo-Nazis who gathered in Washington, D.C., over the weekend to pledge fealty to Trump, arguing that Trump has condemned racism repeatedly and has no ties to either group. By several accounts, there were as many reporters and protesters at the event as there were white nationalists, raising questions about why the event has attracted so much attention.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer exploded at anchor Wolf Blitzer for badgering him on the issue. \"You've asked me eight times the same question,\" Spicer shouted. \"It's the news media over and over again. But I don't know how many times he has to answer that question and you figuring out the way and fashion he should do it next. If he gives a speech, should he then write it in the sky in an airplane? At what point is it enough?\"",
    " Title: USCIS Solicitation Suggests Large-Scale Executive Amnesty Preparations Amidst Election Silence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has gone unnoticed until now, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued a draft solicitation for bids on Oct. 6, indicating a potential surge in work authorization permits, hinting at the possibility of a large-scale executive amnesty. The document, requesting vendors to handle a \"surge\" scenario of 9 million identification cards in a year, suggests an immigration reform initiative that could significantly expand legal immigration.\n\nThe request for proposals (RFP) states that the agency will need a minimum of four million cards per year, with an additional five million cards in the \"surge\" scenario in 2016, totaling 9 million. The RFP also mentions a guaranteed minimum of 4 million cards and an estimated maximum of 34 million cards for the entire contract.\n\nThe RFP is for materials needed to construct both Permanent Residency Cards (PRC), commonly known as green cards, as well as Employment Authorization Documentation (EAD) cards, which have been used to implement President Obama's \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" (DACA) program. The RFP does not specify how many of each type of card would be issued.\n\nJessica Vaughan, an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies and former State Department official, said the document suggests a new program of remarkable breadth. \"The RFP seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that Congress rejected in the 'Gang of Eight' bill,\" Vaughan said.\n\nLast year, Vaughan estimated that the Gang of Eight's provisions would have roughly doubled legal immigration. In the \"surge\" scenario of this RFP, even the relatively high four million cards per year would be more than doubled, meaning that even on its own terms, the agency is preparing for a huge uptick of 125 percent its normal annual output.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for federal agencies to plan for contingencies, the request specifically explains that the surge is related to potential changes in immigration policy. \"The Contractor shall demonstrate the capability to support potential'surge' in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements,\" the document says.\n\nGiven the low chances of a new immigration law following the summer's border crisis, the possibility of this move being in preparation for an executive amnesty by Obama has gained additional credence. Even four million combined green cards and EADs is a significant number, considering that in the first two years after Obama unilaterally enacted DACA, about 600,000 people were approved by USCIS under the program.\n\nVaughan noted that EADs are increasingly coming under scrutiny as a tool used by the Obama administration to provide legalization for groups of illegal aliens short of full green card status. In addition to providing government approval to work for illegal aliens, EADs also cost significantly less in fees to acquire, about $450 compared to more than $1000. In many states, EADs give aliens rights to social services and the ability to obtain drivers' licenses.\n\nVaughan also pointed out that there are currently about 4.5 million individuals waiting for approval for the green cards, having followed immigration law and obtained sponsorships from relatives in the U.S. or otherwise, less than the number of id cards contemplated by the USCIS \"surge.\"\n\nUSCIS officials did not provide additional information about the RFP by press time.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Declares Trump Administration's Sanctuary City Funding Threat Unconstitutional\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York has declared that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January, which withheld federal funding from sanctuary cities, is both illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe ruling, handed down on Friday, aligns with a series of recent court decisions that have invalidated Republican actions against asylum-seekers and sanctuary cities. Judge Ramos' decision specifically targets Section 1373 of the U.S. immigration code, a section that requires information-sharing between the federal government and sanctuary cities, which he found to be a violation of the Tenth Amendment, similar to a California judge's ruling in October.\n\nUnlike previous sanctuary city cases in California, Judge Ramos' decision affects a wide range of states along the East Coast. Cities in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and Virginia will now be legally permitted to function as sanctuaries for asylum-seekers, provided their state governments allow them to do so.\n\nIt is worth noting that while some cities under Democratic control have fought to maintain their legal status as sanctuaries, their commitment to protecting undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers has been questioned, with police departments (including those in New York City) often cooperating with ICE and federal agencies to detain and deport community members.\n\nThis ruling, however, is a significant victory in President Trump's larger war on migrants and refugees, offering a reprieve to cities that have chosen to provide sanctuary to those seeking asylum.",
    " Title: U.S. Administration Faces Internal Disagreement and External Questioning over Iran Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump administration is grappling with a divided message on Iran as a high-ranking military official contradicts the basis for the administration's confrontational strategy and external experts question the U.S.'s endgame. As bombers recently deployed to the Middle East conducted their first message-sending sorties, President Donald Trump appears to be caught between hardline advisors advocating for more aggressive action against Tehran and those seeking to avoid escalation.\n\nIn a notable departure from the Trump administration, a British general, the No. 2 officer in the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, stated Tuesday that the threat from Iran is no greater than it was months ago, prompting a swift rebuke from the Pentagon.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump dismissed a report of plans to send additional troops to the Middle East but also insisted he would do so \"absolutely\" if needed. The president's seemingly contradictory statements have left some experts questioning whether the White House is repeating its aggressive stance toward North Korea before softening the rhetoric in exchange for temporary concessions, a strategy that has been questioned after Kim Jong Un resumed missile tests following Trump's praise for the North Korean leader's suspension of such activities.\n\nTensions with Iran began to escalate this month when National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships were being sent to the region ahead of schedule. A group of bombers was also dispatched, with Bolton citing increasing alarm over threats to the thousands of U.S. troops in the region.\n\nThe following day, Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers noted \"indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against U.S. forces and our interests.\" Ominously, the Pentagon announced the bombers were B-52s, warplanes first flown during the Cold War but updated and capable of loitering aloft with an arsenal of sophisticated weaponry that can be launched from a safe distance at targets inside Iran.\n\nTwo days after Bolton's announcement, Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the military had detected \"credible threat streams emanating from the regime in Iran throughout the CENTCOM area of responsibility.\" By the end of the week, the Pentagon announced it was bolstering the force, sending a Marine transport ship, the USS Arlington, and Patriot air-defense missiles to the region. Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, who commands U.S. forces in the Middle East, had made the request for additional forces, the Pentagon revealed.\n\nMeanwhile, senior military officials, including Patrick Shanahan, the acting Defense Secretary, met quietly on Thursday to develop plans to send as many as 120,000 U.S. troops to the region, according to the New York Times.\n\nTrump offered somewhat contradictory statements Tuesday. Asked about the New York Times report that the administration was considering sending 120,000 troops, the president said no such plans are in the works. But then, in the next breath, he ratcheted up his anti-Iran rhetoric.\n\n\"Would I do that? Absolutely,\" Trump said of troops. If the administration decided to deploy soldiers to the region, he said, \"we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that.\"\n\nHours later, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, the No. 2 officer in Operation Inherent Resolve, told Pentagon reporters the threat from Iran was, in fact, not higher than it was months ago. His comments were at odds with U.S. officials, and Capt. Urban, the spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement that Ghika is wrong.\n\nMichael O' Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against reading too much into the apparent disagreement between coalition officials. \"A threat includes intent to pull the trigger, not just capability \u2013 not just more preparatory activity,\" he said. \"So until the trigger is, in fact, pulled, one can have a full and rich debate.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was traveling in Russia on Tuesday, appeared to tamp down escalating tensions. \"We fundamentally do not see a war with Iran,\" Pompeo said when asked about the New York Times report during a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said the U.S. wants Iran to stop funding terrorist groups and \"behave like a normal country.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official warned Tuesday that the U.S. is playing a \"very dangerous game\" and suggested Trump could \"drag Iran into an unnecessary war.\" Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said Trump made a \"serious miscalculation\" in deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers, and other military personnel and equipment to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, unspecified Iranian threats.\n\nBaeidinejad denied that Iran or its \"proxies\" were behind what Washington described as the \"sabotage\" of oil tankers in the Gulf belonging to Saudi Arabia, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia said drones attacked one of its oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure, an incident that caused global oil price benchmarks to jump.\n\n\"We are prepared for any eventuality,\" Baeidinejad said. \"This I can tell you.\"",
    " Title: Journalist Andy Ngo Assaulted by Antifa Activists During Portland Protest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, photojournalist and editor at Quillette, Andy Ngo, was assaulted by a mob of antifa activists during a protest in Portland on Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred during a demonstration where antifa activists were counter-protesting against several right-wing groups, including the Proud Boys.\n\nNgo, a well-known chronicler of antifa activity, has been vocal in his criticism of their tactics on Fox News. He attended the protest as a journalist, covering a notable public event. According to Ngo, his attacker stole his camera equipment. Video footage recorded by another journalist, Jim Ryan of The Oregonian, shows an antifa activist punching Ngo in the face, and others throwing milkshakes at him.\n\nMilkshakes thrown at political figures, particularly those on the right, has been a tactic used by progressive activists in the UK. U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was hit with one earlier in June. The tactic has its defenders in mainstream left-of-center media as well, with Vox's Carlos Maza tweeting \"milkshake them all\" after a British activist hurled a milkshake at Nigel Farage.\n\nPortland police have claimed that some of the milkshakes thrown by the antifa activists on Saturday contained quick-dry cement. The veracity of this claim is uncertain. However, what is certain is that an antifa mob attacked a journalist\u2014one who is critical of them, but who posed no physical threat and was only there to document their activities\u2014on a public street. This is indefensible, and yet there are many progressive-leaning people currently defending it, or at the very least rationalizing and making light of it.\n\nAntifa, of course, rejects the notion that violence should only be used in response to a physical threat. The group believes that the very existence of far-right people, groups, and ideas is a kind of provocation that justifies violence\u2014against the far-right, and against their enablers. For more information about the ideology, tactics, and goals of the movement, order Andy Ngo's new book, \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,\" which includes an entire chapter on antifa.\n\nNgo has yet to comment on the incident, but he posted a disoriented and clearly injured message on his Twitter page.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler Urges Unredacted Release of Mueller Report, Calls for Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called for the release of the full report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller without any redactions, stating that there could be information in the report that could potentially provide grounds for impeachment or other actions.\n\nThe New York Democrat expressed skepticism towards Attorney General William Barr's recent summary of the report, labeling him as a \"biased defender\" of the Trump administration. Nadler emphasized the need for Congress to have access to the entire report in order to determine the extent of any potential wrongdoing.\n\n\"We are demanding and we have a right, the Congress has a right to the entire report with no redactions whatsoever so we can see what's there,\" said Nadler. He added, \"Who knows? There could be grounds for impeachment. There could be grounds for other action. You can commit shameful acts. You can commit complete betrayals of the public interest without committing impeachable acts. And if you did that, the public ought to know that, too.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has indicated that the report could contain confidential grand jury information, and Nadler acknowledged that lawmakers may have to go to court to secure those parts. However, he remained uncertain about the specifics of what the report would reveal.\n\nIn contrast, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow has expressed little concern about the potential impact of the full report, while Rudolph Giuliani, who is part of the president's legal team, has dismissed Nadler's claims of bias. Giuliani described Barr as a man of \"highest integrity\" and expressed confidence in the report's findings, stating that he is not worried about the report being damaging to President Trump.\n\nIn a four-page summary of the report, Barr stated last month that the report did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia, and that it did not conclude the president obstructed justice after the fact, but that it also did not exonerate him.\n\nThe ongoing debate over the release of the full Mueller report highlights the political divide between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats pushing for transparency and Republicans defending the current administration. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to hold a hearing with Barr on May 2nd, where the issue of the report's release is likely to be a central topic of discussion.",
    " Title: Hurricane Sandy's Political Implications: Five Key Questions Answered\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hurricane Sandy approaches the East Coast, political campaigns have temporarily halted their electioneering efforts, but behind the scenes, political professionals are contemplating the potential impact of the storm on next Tuesday's elections. Here are the answers to five key questions about Hurricane Sandy's impact on the election:\n\n1. How might Hurricane Sandy affect the election outcomes?\nIt is challenging to envision a scenario where the storm benefits the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Romney has narrowed the gap with President Barack Obama in most national polls, but this momentum has not been replicated in crucial states like Ohio and Virginia. Already, Romney had to cancel a full day's worth of events in Virginia on Sunday. President Obama, who is not trying to gain ground, has also had to adjust his schedule. While there are differing opinions on how the storm might influence voters' feelings about the candidates or voter turnout, it is difficult to see how the storm could help Romney, unless the government's response is poorly managed, and voters blame President Obama.\n\n2. Does President Obama have a natural advantage due to his incumbency?\nYes, but only if he avoids unforced errors. While President Obama's response to Hurricane Katrina is often cited as one of the worst blunders in modern presidential history, it has also ensured that no president or candidate will under-react to the threat of a devastating natural disaster. As president, Obama's best politics are to simply perform his duties competently. On Sunday, he visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters for a briefing, which is prominently displayed on the White House website.\n\n3. How will travel restrictions affect the candidates' campaigns?\nThe storm will make it difficult for Romney to make the final push in states affected by the storm, such as Virginia, Florida, and New Hampshire. Romney plans to visit Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio on Monday, critical states where he still needs to make up ground. One Democrat noted, \"To the degree it impacts travel\u2014canceling trips to places like New Hampshire\u2014makes it hard to make up the gap.\"\n\n4. How will the storm affect voter turnout?\nIt is difficult to predict the exact impact of the storm on voter turnout, but it is likely that the storm will affect turnout in states that are directly impacted by the hurricane. Voters in these areas may be preoccupied with securing their homes, families, and communities, which could potentially reduce their likelihood of voting.\n\n5. How will the storm affect early voting?\nEarly voting has already begun in several states, and it is likely that early voting will continue in states that are not directly impacted by the storm. However, it is possible that the storm could affect early voting in states that are impacted, as polling places may be closed or voters may be unable to travel to their polling locations.\n\nIn conclusion, Hurricane Sandy's impact on the election remains uncertain, but it is clear that the storm will present challenges for both candidates and could potentially affect voter turnout and travel plans. The storm's aftermath could also influence voters' feelings about the candidates, particularly if the government's response is poorly managed.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Investigation: What It Means for Donald Trump and the Trump-Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, US Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly using a grand jury in Washington. Here's what you need to know about grand juries and their implications for President Trump.\n\nWhat is a grand jury and how serious is it for Donald Trump?\n\nA grand jury is a body of about 16 to 23 citizens who investigate criminal matters in secret. Unlike a trial jury, a grand jury's purpose is to determine whether there is enough evidence to indict a suspect. The use of a grand jury in this case suggests that Mueller's investigation is serious and could potentially lead to criminal charges.\n\nGrand juries are a powerful investigative tool, allowing them to subpoena witnesses and demand the production of documents. Notable figures such as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton have testified before grand juries in the past. Donald Trump Jr. and President Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, could potentially be called to testify over their controversial June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\n\nUnlike in ordinary courts, witnesses are not allowed to have lawyers present during questioning. Witnesses are also not allowed to answer questions while consulting with their lawyers, and grand juries are characterized by the time-consuming act of witnesses going in and out.\n\nMueller, who was appointed special counsel in May following the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, has been investigating since May whether members of the Trump team have lied about links to Russians and whether Trump himself tried to obstruct justice. As of yet, no subpoenas have been received by the president or Kushner.\n\nHow long will it take for a grand jury to decide if criminal charges should be brought?\n\nGrand juries tend to be slow, running for months or even years. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed reports of links to Russia as \"fake news.\"\n\nIn a rally in West Virginia on Thursday night, Trump told his supporters, \"They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story.\"\n\nThe use of a grand jury in the Trump-Russia probe underscores the seriousness of the investigation and the potential for criminal charges to be brought against members of the Trump team. The outcome of the investigation remains uncertain, but the use of a grand jury indicates that Mueller's investigation is far from over.",
    " Title: Acquittal vs. Exoneration: Trump's Impeachment Trial and the Concept of Political Accountability\n\n(CNN) - John Avlon, a CNN senior political analyst, argues that the Senate's acquittal of President Donald Trump does not equate to exoneration in an impeachment trial. The President's actions during the Ukraine scandal will be a permanent part of his presidential legacy, placing him in a \"presidential hall of shame.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial's outcome was predictable, as no American president has been removed from office following a Senate trial. However, impeachment will be a significant footnote in Trump's obituary, as it involves foreign interference in elections, a concern the Founding Fathers held dear.\n\nUnlike the impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, this impeachment was not about obscure matters like violating the \"tenure of office act\" or lying under oath about an affair. Instead, it was about foreign interference in elections, a matter the Founding Fathers feared and warned against.\n\nTrump's acquittal should not be seen as a victory, as surviving impeachment is not a \"gold star.\" The President's approval rating ticked up to 49%, but his \"removal rating\" - the portion of Americans who thought the Senate should convict him - remains higher than his approval rating.\n\nThroughout the trial, the President and his legal team argued that he did nothing wrong. Michael Purpura, one of his lead lawyers, stated, \"The facts and evidence of the case the house managers have brought exonerate the President.\" However, this was not the case, as the Democrats had proven their case.\n\nThe call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine, which led to the impeachment, was \"off-the-rails wrong,\" according to \"Fox and Friends\" host Steve Doocy. By the end of the trial, at least a half-dozen Republicans admitted that Trump's conduct was wrong, and the evidence did not exonerate him.\n\nThe Founding Fathers defined impeachable offenses as those that proceed from the misconduct of public men or the abuse or violation of some public trust. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, stated that the subjects of the jurisdiction are offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\n\nThe argument that obstruction of Congress was an absurd charge was also debunked. Washington specifically wrote that Congress could not get its hands on his papers - except in the case of impeachment. The argument that a president could not be impeached for actions that help him get elected was also refuted, as the Founding Fathers anticipated that a president might \"betray his trust to foreign powers.\"\n\nThe lack of interest in calling witnesses could open the door to a massive expansion of presidential power while effectively opening the door to foreign interference in our elections. This is happening at exactly the same time that we know foreign powers are trying to interfere in our elections.\n\nAn elegant solution to this collective failure of political courage would have been to censure the President, as Sen. Joe Manchin proposed. However, this was dismissed by some senators, like Susan Collins, who said it was proposed too late in the process.\n\nMitt Romney's speech was a reminder that principles matter more than party loyalty and oaths \"to do impartial justice\" should be upheld. Fear of hyperpartisan reprisals and bullying tactics from the President should not be enough for senators or citizens to abandon their conscience or common sense. Moral courage is an essential quality in a functioning democracy.\n\nFor all their far-sighted insights into human nature, the Founding Fathers did not anticipate the ways that hyperpartisan polarization could short-circuit our system of checks and balances while causing the Senate to forget first principles. It's up to all of us as citizens to reassert first principles and core values - like truth defeats lies - to change the equation and cause our elected officials to remember that decency and honesty can be the most practical form of politics.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on China over Uighur Muslim Repression in Xinjiang\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday that imposes sanctions on those responsible for the repression of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. The bill, which passed the U.S. Congress with a single 'no' vote, aims to send a strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those involved in the oppression of China's Muslim minority.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that over one million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang, which China claims are vocational skills training centers necessary to combat extremism. However, China's foreign ministry has labeled the U.S. law a malicious attack, urging the U.S. to correct its mistakes and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.\n\nPresident Trump issued a \"signing statement\" alongside the law, stating that some of the sanctions' requirements might limit his constitutional authority as president to conduct diplomacy. As a result, he regards the sanctions as advisory rather than mandatory.\n\nThe Uighur law calls for sanctions on Xinjiang's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, for \"gross human rights violations.\" It also encourages U.S. companies with operations in Xinjiang to ensure their supply chains are free from forced labor.\n\nThe World Uyghur Congress, one of the main Uighur exile groups, welcomed Trump's move, stating that the law gives hope to the desperate Uighur people. The law's passage comes amidst allegations in a new book by Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, that Trump spoke approvingly of China's internment of Uighurs during a G20 meeting in 2019. Bolton's book also alleges that Trump made similar comments during a 2017 trip to China.",
    " Title: Pelosi and Journalist James Rosen Exchange Words Over Whistleblower Anonymity at Press Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and journalist James Rosen of Sinclair Broadcast Group engaged in a heated exchange over the issue of whistleblower anonymity.\n\nRosen, who is a Fox News alum, asked Pelosi, \"And so I wonder if you could explain to the American people why the legal rights of the whistleblower should prevail in this political setting over those of President Trump, who should ordinarily enjoy a right to confront his accuser?\"\n\nPelosi responded, \"I'll say to you, Mr. Republican Talking Points, what I said to the president of the United States: When you talk about the whistleblower, you're coming into my wheelhouse.\" She then went on to highlight her extensive legislative experience in intelligence matters, stating, \"I have more experience in intelligence than anybody in the Congress, anybody that's ever served, 25 years on the committee as top Democrat, ex officio, as Speaker and leader. I was there when we wrote the whistleblower laws.\"\n\nPelosi continued, \"The whistleblower is there to speak truth to power and have protection for doing that. And any, any retribution or harm coming to a whistleblower undermines our ability to hear truth about power. So, I will defend the rights of the whistleblower vehemently, vehemently.\"\n\nWhen Rosen pushed back, Pelosi said Trump can make his case to those overseeing impeachment proceedings, adding that \"the president is not above the law, the president will be held accountable, and nobody should have the right to endanger whistleblowers, and that is the system that I will defend.\"\n\nThe exchange between Pelosi and Rosen was met with criticism from some commenters on Rosen's tweet, with some accusing Pelosi of personal attacks and polarizing tactics. However, others defended Rosen and his question, stating that it was a valid inquiry that should have been asked.\n\nRosen, who was spied on by the Obama administration, later reported on the issues he brought up at the press conference and said Pelosi \"grew testy,\" \"attacked\" him, and resorted to \"personal disparagement\" in response to his question.",
    " Title: \" Republican Party Faces Demographic Challenges as Minority Voters Grow in Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, the Republican Party is grappling with a significant demographic shift that has seen the growth of minority constituencies, particularly among Asian-Americans and Hispanics, who have traditionally leaned towards the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, this issue is no longer just important, but essential for the Republican Party. \"Before, we thought it was an important issue, but now we know it's an essential issue,\" he said. \"You have to ignore reality not to deal with this issue.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's central problem lies in the fact that the Democratic Party's biggest constituencies are growing, while the party's traditional base of older white voters is shrinking. In the 2012 election, President Obama won a second term despite winning only 39 percent of white voters and 44 percent of voters older than 65, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.\n\nThe Republican Party, according to former strategist for George W. Bush, Mark McKinnon, needs to adopt messages and policies that appeal to a broader audience. \"This election proved that trying to expand a shrinking base ain't going to cut it,\" he said. \"It's time to put some compassion back in conservatism. The party needs more tolerance, more diversity, and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.\"\n\nThe immediate question for the Republican Party, according to people within the party, is how to improve their image with voters they are already losing in large numbers. Corey Stewart, a Republican running for lieutenant governor next year, believes that the party needs to modulate its tone to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nIn Prince William, as elsewhere, the biggest challenge for Republicans may be among Hispanic voters, given their numbers. Hispanic voters were almost one-fifth of the electorate in Florida, and President Obama won about three-fifths of them. In Colorado, 14 percent of the voters were Hispanic, and President Obama won three-fourths of them.\n\nThe Republican Party's coalition is contracting, not expanding, according to Tom Davis, a former Republican member of Congress who represented Dale City. The party needs to find a way to broaden its reach, in part by finding more minority and female candidates to run under the Republican banner, Mr. Davis argues.\n\nRepublicans like Mr. Davis are quick to point out that the election this week was close, not a blowout. However, they must be honest with themselves about the future, he says. \"It is time to sit down practically and say where are we going to add pieces to our coalition,\" he said. \"There just are not enough middle-aged white guys that we can scrape together to win. There's just not enough of them.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Recovery Remains Sluggish, Leaving Millions on the Sidelines and Complicating Fed's Tapering Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market recovery, while showing incremental improvements, remains slow and is leaving millions of Americans on the sidelines, complicating the Federal Reserve's decision on when to taper its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program.\n\nIn August, employers added 169,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's report on Friday, a slight increase from July's figure, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.3%, the best mark of the recovery. However, beneath these positive numbers lies evidence of a job market stuck in second gear. The government revised down its estimate for June and July hiring by a combined 74,000 jobs, and a disproportionate share of the jobs being added are in low-paying sectors such as restaurants and retail. At the current pace of hiring, the economy will not return to pre-recession levels of employment, adjusting for population growth, for more than eight years.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell not because people found jobs but because they stopped looking. The number of people reporting they had jobs\u2014a measure based on a separate survey from the one used to calculate payroll gains\u2014fell by 115,000 in August. As a share of the population, fewer Americans are working or looking for work than at any time in the past 35 years.\n\n\"There is little evidence that the overall economy is accelerating,\" said Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick LLP, an accounting and advisory firm. \"Even with these incremental improvements, the recovery remains subpar.\"\n\nAugust's jobs numbers suggest the recovery is not gaining strength, which may complicate the Fed's plans for tapering. Many private-sector economists had been expecting the pullback to begin at the Fed's September policy meeting, and such a move remains possible. Job growth has remained steady, and the unemployment rate continues to fall. However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and other board members have stressed that they are watching a range of job-market indicators, many of which suggest less improvement.\n\n\"I don't think it truly tilts the balance away from the Fed starting to dial back bond buying in September,\" said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc. \"But it's no longer the slam dunk that it would have been.\"\n\nAugust's lackluster report stands in contrast with other recent signals that the economy is gaining momentum. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are expanding, exports have held up despite weak growth overseas, and the housing market is mending, although rising mortgage rates may curb activity. Car sales recently surpassed their pre-recession levels, and broader measures of spending and confidence suggest consumers were relatively unfazed by early-2013 obstacles such as higher taxes and gas prices and the federal budget cuts known as the sequester.\n\nFriday's Labor Department snapshot, too, contained some encouraging details. Average hourly earnings and hours worked both climbed, after falling in July. Local governments, which slashed jobs during the recession and early in the recovery, added workers for the fifth time in six months. Full-time employment increased, and the number of workers stuck involuntarily in part-time jobs fell sharply.\n\nHowever, such positive signals were overshadowed by the continued exodus from the American labor force. The share of the population that is working or looking for work\u2014a measure known as the participation rate\u2014fell to its lowest level since 1978, when women were still under-represented in the workforce and manufacturing accounted for more than a quarter of private-sector jobs.\n\nThe decline in labor-force participation reflects, to some degree, long-term trends, such as an aging population and increased rates of college attendance. The rate has been trending down since 2000, and government economists expected it to keep falling even before the recession hit.\n\nHowever, much of the recent decline has been driven by the weak economy. Nearly a million Americans say they have given up looking for work because they do not believe they can find a job, and millions more say they would like to work but are not actively searching. August was the 40th consecutive month in which more unemployed workers left the labor market than found jobs.\n\nWhen\u2014and if\u2014those workers will return to the labor force is one of the most significant questions for both short-term economic policy and long-term economic growth. Economists increasingly fear that many of the labor-force dropouts may be gone for good: Hundreds of thousands more workers are receiving federal disability benefits than before the recession, and research shows many employers won't even consider hiring the long-term jobless. However, much of the decline in the labor force has been among younger workers, many of whom are likely to return to work if hiring picks up.\n\nSo far, however, there is little sign of that happening. More than 4 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, and their odds of finding a job have barely improved in the past two years, even as prospects have improved for the more recently unemployed.\n\nPhilip Hasskarl has spent much of the past three years looking for work. The 61-year-old Haverhill, Mass., resident finally found a job last year, only to lose it in February when his employer cut the company sales force to 14 people from 50. He said he recently had three interviews and remains optimistic, but has little doubt that his age is making it harder to find work.\n\nMr. Hasskarl, who trained people to sell medical devices, said giving up is not an option. He and his wife \"burned through whatever I had set aside for retirement just to keep the house,\" he said.\n\nMost experts attribute the subdued pace of hiring to lackluster economic growth, which has given companies little reason to add workers.\n\n\"There has not been enough duration of strong economic growth for companies to choose to shift hiring into a higher gear on permanent employees,\" said Carl Camden, chief executive of temporary-staffing firm Kelly Services Inc. \"I'm already hearing\u2026customers wondering when the next recession is going to hit.\"\n\nFor other companies, the recession never ended. Jay Lunt, owner and president of Folkers Window Co. in Pensacola, Fla., said real estate \"hasn't recovered at all\" on Florida's Gulf Coast. As a result, Mr. Lunt, whose company installs doors and storm shutters, has no plans to add to his workforce of 23 full-time employees.\n\n\"The bottom line is when the customers are not out there to buy your product, there's no reason for expansion,\" he said. \"When people start spending money\u2026we gear up to address that.\"",
    " Title: Homeland Security Details Separation of Children at Border Under Zero Tolerance Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press briefing on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed that nearly 2,000 children were apprehended at the border with their parents or guardians between April 19 and May 31, under the Trump administration's new zero tolerance policy. A total of 1,995 juveniles traveling with 1,940 adults were detained during this period, according to DHS.\n\nThe separation of children from their parents has become a contentious issue in the ongoing immigration debate, with both Democrats and some Republicans in Congress expressing concern over the practice. DHS, however, maintains that they are enforcing the law as it stands.\n\nIn response to a CNN report alleging a mother's baby being taken from her while she was nursing, a DHS official refuted the claim, stating that they have been unable to verify the incident. \"We do not separate babies from adults,\" the official said, labeling the report as false.\n\nThe official also criticized media personalities who compared immigration authorities to Nazis, stating that such comparisons were disrespectful to law enforcement officers carrying out their duties according to the laws passed by Congress.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough and other network figures have made such comparisons in recent days. On Thursday, Scarborough said parents were being told their children were being \"taken off to the showers,\" and then separated. On Friday, Stephanie Cutter compared the detention facilities to \"concentration camps,\" and Michael Steele warned viewers that \"your kids could be next.\"\n\nThe DHS official who briefed reporters emphasized that immigration officers and agents deserved better treatment, stating, \"For someone sitting in a studio to go on air and call them Nazis for doing their jobs, as called for by the laws Congress passed, it's really disgusting.\" The official added that they were awaiting an apology from the offending parties.",
    " Title: The Debate on Marijuana Legalization: A Neutral Analysis of the Arguments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the legal marijuana industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, with projections by Marijuana Business Daily's \"Marijuana Business Factbook 2017\" suggesting a 30% increase in sales this year, 45% in 2018, and a cumulative 300% growth between 2016 and 2021, reaching a market value of approximately $17 billion. This growth has attracted significant investment, yet the federal government maintains its stance on marijuana, classifying it as a Schedule I drug, with no recognized medical benefits and illegal status, similar to LSD and heroin.\n\nThis article will present three arguments for legalization, followed by three arguments for maintaining marijuana as a Schedule I drug.\n\nFirstly, public opinion polls consistently indicate a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization. Gallup's October 2016 poll and CBS News' April 2017 poll found 60% and 61% support, respectively, for legal marijuana nationwide. A Quinnipiac University poll from April 2021 showed 94% support for legal medical cannabis, compared to 5% who opposed the idea. As elected officials are meant to represent the will of the people, failure to adjust cannabis scheduling in line with public opinion could potentially lead to a loss of voter support.\n\nSecondly, clinical data suggests marijuana may offer positive health benefits. For example, a study published in the American Public Health Association this week found that since Colorado legalized recreational cannabis, opioid-related deaths have decreased by 6.5%. The study suggests marijuana could serve as an alternative to pain-fighting opioids, offering a safer option.\n\nThirdly, legalization could lead to increased tax revenue and job creation. As the industry grows, so too does the potential for job opportunities and tax revenue generation. This could help alleviate budgetary constraints in states that legalize marijuana.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments for maintaining marijuana as a Schedule I drug include:\n\nFirstly, the potential negative health effects of marijuana use, particularly on adolescents, are a significant concern. Studies have shown that marijuana use during adolescence can impact brain development and lead to long-term cognitive impairment.\n\nSecondly, the lack of long-term, large-scale clinical studies on marijuana makes it difficult to fully understand its potential risks and benefits. More research is needed to ensure that any potential benefits are weighed against potential risks.\n\nThirdly, there are concerns about the impact of legal marijuana on public safety. This includes the potential for increased impaired driving incidents and the potential for marijuana to serve as a gateway drug.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on marijuana legalization is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. As more states move towards legalization, it is crucial to continue researching and understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with marijuana use.",
    " Title: Shift in Republican Presidential Race: Ben Carson Overtakes Donald Trump in Latest CBS/New York Times Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential race has taken an unexpected turn, with neurosurgeon Ben Carson now leading Donald Trump and the Republican field in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Carson garnered 26 percent of the vote, while Trump earned 22 percent. Although Carson's lead is within the margin of error, this marks a significant shift in longstanding trends.\n\nTrump, who has been the frontrunner for several months, appears to have been surpassed by Carson, particularly among key demographics, such as evangelicals. The CBS report highlights Carson's advantages:\n\nCarson has made gains across many key Republican groups. In a reversal from earlier this month, he now leads Trump among women and is running neck and neck with him among men. Carson's support among evangelicals has risen, and he now leads Trump by more than 20 points with this group. Carson performs well among conservative Republicans and those who identify as Tea Partiers.\n\nThe shift in support among men and Tea Partiers, relative to Trump, is somewhat surprising. Tea Partiers, known for their negative and obstructionist approach to politics, don't typically align with policy-focused candidates. However, both Carson and Trump share a common appeal: they are outsiders with no political experience who aim to disrupt the status quo.\n\nTrump's louder and more aggressively obnoxious demeanor might have traditionally appealed to these demographics, but Carson's unassuming, unhinged nice-guy routine seems to be resonating. His new campaign ad, which promises to balance the budget, secure the border, and put aside partisanship without offering specifics, encapsulates both his appeal and his vacuity.\n\nOne of the more interesting findings in the new CBS/NYT poll is that 55 percent of Trump backers say their support is firm, while 80 percent of Carson supporters say they could change their minds. This suggests Carson may be more of a \"flavor of the month\" candidate than Trump.\n\nDespite Carson's boost in the polls, his long-term viability remains debatable. If this trend continues for another month or two, however, Trump might face real challenges. Carson's strong showing in Iowa, thanks to his support among evangelicals, is noteworthy, but the GOP's last two Iowa winners \u2013 Santorum and Huckabee \u2013 lost the nomination. Trump, on the other hand, is well-positioned in other early primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he remains comfortably ahead of Carson.",
    " Title: Trump's Approval Rating Drops: A Look at the Controversy Surrounding Polling and Media Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Fox News, President Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to 40%, down from 45% in the previous month. The poll also revealed that 53% of respondents believe Trump's agenda is unraveling, while 44% believe he is shaking up Washington. The poll also showed that 68% approve of the Department of Justice naming a special counsel, while 29% disapprove.\n\nHowever, the release of these findings sparked a wave of angry responses on Twitter, with many Trump supporters attacking the poll and the media in general. The responses ranged from accusations of media bias to claims that the polls are flawed or simply wrong.\n\nDespite the backlash, the poll results are in line with other recent polls, with Gallup, Quinnipiac, Economist, and Reuters all reporting similar approval ratings for Trump. The exception is Rasmussen, which puts Trump's approval at 48%.\n\nThe responses to the poll reveal a troubling trend of distrust in the media and polling, with many Trump supporters dismissing news organizations and their polling as mere fiction. This distrust is not limited to Fox News, with many also turning away from more traditional news sources such as the New York Times and Washington Post.\n\nThe lack of trust in the media and polling is concerning, as it undermines the role of news in fostering intelligent debate and promoting a shared understanding of the facts. As the polls show, Trump's approval rating is low, but the responses to the poll reveal a deeper issue: a growing divide between conservatives and liberals, with each side turning to their own opinionated media sources and constructing their social media feeds in a way that reinforces their own beliefs.\n\nIn the end, the role of news in fostering intelligent debate is decimated when everything is labeled as fake news. And it's not just a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact, as the polls show.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 220,000 Jobs in June, Unemployment Rate Remains at 4.4 Percent\n\nThe U.S. economy showed a strong performance in June, with the addition of 220,000 jobs, according to the latest labor statistics released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This figure surpassed analysts' expectations of 174,000 jobs and marks the best showing since February.\n\nThe number of employed Americans, which set records in February, March, and April, reached another high in June, at 153,168,000. The number of Americans not in the labor force, after four consecutive monthly gains, dropped slightly to 94,813,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained steady at 4.4 percent. Projections by the Economic Policy Institute suggest that it could drop to 4.0 percent by January 2019 if the current rate of decline continues, as it did from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016.\n\nThe labor force participation rate rose 0.1 percent to 62.8 percent. The BLS report excluded Americans who are retired, students, homemakers, the disabled, and any other individuals who have stopped looking for employment.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady attributed the positive report to the Republican party's efforts to roll back regulations. He stated, \"With President Trump in the White House, Republicans have already taken historic steps to roll back damaging regulations that have discouraged investment, dragged down our nation\u2019s productivity, and left too many workers waiting for better employment opportunities.\"\n\nBrady added that the Republicans aim to further improve these numbers by enacting meaningful tax reform.\n\nWhile conservative groups have welcomed the positive news, some, such as Ed Morrissey of Hot Air, have cautioned against celebrating too soon, as Republicans have yet to implement a significant portion of their economic agenda.",
    " Title: U.S. Aid to Iraq Enhances Counterterrorism Efforts, but No Plans for Armed Drone Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is providing significant aid to Iraq to bolster its counterterrorism efforts, but there are no plans for American-operated armed drones to carry out strikes within Iraq. This development comes as Iraq's foreign minister has suggested the use of such drones to combat the expanding militant network, but no formal request has been made, and the Obama administration has not expressed support for the idea.\n\nThe aid package includes a shipment of 75 Hellfire missiles, delivered last week, which are being used by small Cessna turboprop planes to target militant camps with covert C.I.A. assistance. Additionally, 10 ScanEagle reconnaissance drones are expected to be delivered by March, smaller cousins of the larger Predators that once patrolled Iraqi skies.\n\nAmerican intelligence and counterterrorism officials have reportedly mapped the locations and origins of the Qaeda network in Iraq, and this information is being shared with Iraqi forces. The aid is significant, as the Iraqi military, with a limited air force and reconnaissance capabilities, has struggled to locate and strike Qaeda militants in western and northern Iraq.\n\nThe combination of American-supplied Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, tactical drones, and intelligence is intended to augment Iraq's limited ability to counter militant activity. The Obama administration has also provided three sensor-laden Aerostat balloons, three reconnaissance helicopters, and is planning to send 48 Raven reconnaissance drones before the end of 2014. Furthermore, the first of the F-16 fighters Iraq has purchased is expected to be delivered in the fall.\n\nDespite the ongoing aid, the Obama administration has not received a formal request for U.S.-operated armed drones to operate over Iraq, and there are no plans to divert armed Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions over Iraq. This development may raise questions about the Obama administration's commitment to bringing the Iraq war to a \"responsible end,\" as President Obama has described it.",
    " Title: McConnell's Political Evolution: From Centrist to Conservative Senate Majority Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, the long-serving Senate Majority Leader, reflects a transformation not only of his party but also of his home state. As a young Republican in a Democratic-leaning Kentucky, McConnell was a centrist, supporting collective-bargaining rights and backing moderate candidates. He even ran for office with the endorsement of local labor groups and The Courier-Journal.\n\nHowever, after his ascension to the Senate, McConnell aligned himself with the conservative tide sweeping his party. He changed his stance on issues like collective-bargaining rights and minimum wage increases, and he abandoned his previous support for pork-barrel spending projects. McConnell attributes this shift to the growing appeal of conservatism, citing Ronald Reagan as a significant influence.\n\nIn 1997, McConnell became the head of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, and in 2002, he ascended to his party's deputy post, paving the way for him to become the Republican leader after Frist stepped aside. Critics argue that McConnell's political evolution is driven more by a desire to maintain power than by ideological convictions.\n\nWhen asked about his plans if he became majority leader amid a deeply divided nation, McConnell expressed a desire to restore the Senate as a chamber of deliberative debate, rather than political theater. However, he acknowledged that maintaining a majority in the Senate could lead to taking politically challenging votes to pass bills.\n\nMcConnell's significant legislative achievements include his attempts to block the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, his buyout of tobacco farmers, extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, and support of various First Amendment-related causes.\n\nKentucky, historically ferociously divided during the Civil War, is now a chaotic patchwork of political and cultural regions. The state's political landscape is marked by the Democrats' dominance in urban areas and survival along rural borders. However, longtime Democrats in rural regions increasingly see Republicans as more culturally in step on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and the environment.\n\nIn the upcoming Senate race, Alison Lundergan Grimes will need to run up huge advantages in Louisville and Lexington to offset the rest of the state. McConnell's strategy, on the other hand, is to wash out the cities with a tidal wave of rural votes. Kentucky, once a Democratic stronghold, now leans Republican, with no Democratic Senate winner since 1992 and no Democratic presidential candidate carrying the state since 1996. John Yarmuth is the only Democratic congressman in the state.",
    " Title: \"Mitt Romney's Struggles as a Political Candidate: A Personal and Professional Assessment\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the Republican campaign, the focus has shifted from the convention, leaked videos, and campaign strategy to the candidate himself, Mitt Romney. As the Republican Party grapples with the perceived shortcomings of the Romney campaign, those who know him personally and professionally offer a simple explanation: Mitt Romney, they argue, is not a natural political candidate for this era.\n\nDespite his leadership skills, business acumen, and personal integrity, Romney's admirers acknowledge that he is not a good political candidate. A top Romney official succinctly sums up this sentiment, \"Lousy candidate; highly qualified to be president.\" The candidate's professional suit, they argue, does not fit him naturally; he is an executive, not a politician.\n\nRomney himself has been a self-critic, acknowledging his mistakes, such as the secret video where he wrote off 47 percent of Americans as ungovernable and out of reach politically. He has admitted, \"That's not the campaign. That was me, right?\" This self-awareness, his closest confidants believe, is a testament to his leadership abilities, but it has also contributed to his struggles on the campaign trail.\n\nRomney is respected by his staff, works hard on his weaknesses, and is driven by a supreme confidence in his leadership abilities. However, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and personal style seem ill-suited for the current political climate. He is a son of privilege who made hundreds of millions in private equity, running in the first election since the 2008 economic meltdown, an event many blame on rich, Wall Street tycoons. Furthermore, he is a socially stiff relic of a pre-ironic America, who struggles with improvisation and personal connections in an era that demands both.\n\nDespite these challenges, others have overcome innate political limitations to reach the White House, such as George H.W. Bush and Richard Nixon. Romney's advisers recognize they have 40 days to make his fundamental strength - a track record of high professional achievement - erase concerns about his weaknesses as a political performer. The question remains whether Romney can adapt quickly enough to connect with voters and secure the presidency.",
    " Title: Op-Ed: A Call for Balanced Immigration Reform, Opposing National ID and Invasive Worker-Verification Systems\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding immigration reform, a controversial bill recently passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee has sparked controversy. The bill, expected to be considered by the Senate in June, includes measures such as a strong E-Verify system and a \"photo tool,\" which many see as a means to control unlawful immigrants' access to unlawful employment. However, I argue that these measures go too far and infringe upon individual privacy.\n\nI propose a different approach to immigration reform that secures the border, expands existing work-visa programs, and prevents noncitizens from accessing welfare. This simple yet effective solution eliminates the perceived need for an invasive worker-verification system and a government-run citizenship database.\n\nThe idea of American citizens being forced to carry a National Identification Card as a condition of citizenship is a concern. I am wary of the Senate's consideration of provisions in comprehensive immigration reform that may lead to a national ID card for all individuals present in the United States, both citizens and noncitizens. Such draconian ideas would grant the government too much power.\n\nForcing Americans to carry identification cards to affirmatively prove citizenship offends our basic concept of freedom. The desire to avoid a \"papers please\" culture in our country is also why conservatives oppose federal universal gun background checks. We oppose such measures not because we don't believe in common-sense rules or regulation, but because we are cautious of giving the federal government this kind of centralized power over our daily lives.\n\nI am against government lists of those who own or have transferred a firearm for the same reason I oppose any pathway to a national ID. I do not think that the government should have the power to monitor the legal activities of American citizens. That is not a proper role of the federal government, or any level of government, for that matter.\n\nI am opposed to immigration reform that contains the photo tool in the Interior Enforcement and Employment Verification System title of the bill. This provision, in the name of preventing the \"unlawful employment of aliens,\" enables employers to match the photo on a provided identify document to a photo maintained by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services database. This, too, is troubling.\n\nA national picture database of all citizens raises the question: What activities will require someone to present their papers? A national ID allows more power to gravitate to Washington and a greater likelihood that power will be abused. I will fight to remove the photo tool from this legislation because I think it will become a national ID.\n\nWe already know the federal government is rife with false positives on the no-fly list and the National Instant Check system for gun buyers. Why would we be foolish enough to think that a massive database of all citizens would not have the same problems on a grander scale?\n\nWe have a Second Amendment that must be protected. We also have a Fourth Amendment that must be protected. Citizenship means that the government is supposed to protect our rights, not take them away. We must have stronger borders, but there's no reason we can't have better security while respecting constitutional limits and liberties.\n\nIn the past week, we have witnessed examples of the Obama administration spying on the media and Internal Revenue Service discrimination against Tea Party free speech. People around the world always have dreamed of emigrating to America, the Land of the Free. It is our job to make sure our country stays that way.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees.",
    " Title: Apple Unveils Apple Watch, Delays Release Until Early 2015, Introduces New iPhone Models\n\nIn a much-anticipated event on Tuesday, Apple Inc. officially entered the wearable technology market with the unveiling of the Apple Watch. The event, held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, California, also saw the introduction of new additions to Apple's iPhone family, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook declared the Apple Watch as the \"next chapter\" in Apple's story during the event. Despite speculation that the device would be available in time for the holiday season, the Apple Watch will not be released until early next year, with prices starting from $349.\n\nIn addition to the Apple Watch, Apple also unveiled the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, which Cook described as the biggest advancements in iPhone history. The new phones are thinner than previous versions, featuring Retina HD displays and an enhanced A8 processor, which is 50 percent more efficient than the A7 processor found on the iPhone 5s and 5c. The phones also mark the debut of Apple Pay, a contactless mobile payment technology.\n\nApple Pay will be supported by companies such as Mastercard, Visa, and American Express, as well as retailers like Target and Whole Foods. Tech analysts had hoped that Apple would launch the watch in time for the lucrative holiday season, particularly as rival Samsung ramps up its efforts in the smartwatch space.\n\nContrary to expectations, the Apple Watch is not intended to replace existing devices. During his speech, Cook made it clear that the watch is designed to work with the iPhone. The Apple Watch will be available in three versions - Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition, a high-end version built using 18-karat rose or yellow gold. The watch will also be available in two sizes - 38 mm and 42 mm.\n\nThe Apple Watch boasts several unique features, such as its 'Digital Crown' - a small dial on the side of the device used to navigate through the watch's screens. Other features include a \"taptic engine,\" which subtly vibrates to alert users of messages or notifications, and sensors to monitor vital signs such as heart rate.\n\nApple appears to be emphasizing variety in its smartwatch strategy, offering a range of different straps, from a 'Sport Band' made from Elastomer to a leather quilted leather loop to a stainless steel bracelet.\n\nCharles King, principal analyst of the Hayward, Calif.-based tech research firm Pund-IT, expressed surprise that Apple will not launch its smartwatch until 2015. \"If you're going to launch a luxury item weeks before a holiday buying season starts and then tell people that it won't be available in time for the holiday season - what's the point?\" he told FoxNews.com.\n\nKing also noted that some Apple users may face a costly upgrade if they want to use the Apple Watch, as the device only works with iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6, or 6 Plus running iOS8, the latest version of Apple's operating system.\n\nBoth the new phones come in gold, silver, and space gray. Pricing for the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for a 16GB version, $299 for a 64GB model, and $399 for a 128GB version. The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for a 16GB model, $399 for a 64GB version, and $499 for a 128GB model of the phone. The devices will be available in the U.S. on September 19.",
    " Title: Texas Court Grants Sole Custody to Mother in Controversial Gender Identity Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly contentious custody battle that has garnered national attention, a Texas jury has decided to grant sole managing conservatorship of a seven-year-old child, James, to the child's mother, Anne Georgulas, a pediatrician. The father, Jeff Younger, had argued that James is not transgender and that a \"social transition\" or \"medical transition\" would not be in his best interest.\n\nFor a week, jurors listened to the family court trial between Younger and Georgulas, who disagreed over whether James has gender dysphoria and, if so, whether they should affirm their child's gender identity or adopt a \"watchful waiting\" approach. The jury's decision means that Georgulas, who contends that James is transgender and should be affirmed by allowing him to wear dresses and sending him to school as a girl named \"Luna,\" will have sole decision-making authority over James and his twin brother, Jude.\n\nYounger had argued that James is not transgender and is content being a boy. He had also filed a request for sole managing conservatorship over James and Jude. Georgulas had filed a request to modify their joint managing conservatorship, asking the court to require Younger to refer to James as \"Luna\" and to follow the recommendations of the therapists regarding his gender identity.\n\nThe trial saw testimony from therapists and counselors who supported Georgulas' position, stating that James had expressed a desire to be called \"Luna\" and identified as a girl. Younger's witnesses, who were medical professionals, testified about the dangers of a \"social transition\" and the potential risks associated with subsequent \"medical transitions,\" which can include puberty suppression, cross-sex hormones, and surgical removal of reproductive organs.\n\nIn their closing arguments, both parties reiterated their positions. Georgulas argued for a revised joint custody agreement, while Younger sought to become the sole managing conservator. An amicus attorney, appointed by the court to provide a more neutral perspective, suggested that the parents remain joint managing conservators and that the court address the father's concerns in its ruling.\n\nThe jury's verdict, delivered today, saw them answer two questions: whether the current joint managing conservatorship should change to a sole managing conservatorship, and, if so, whether Younger should be the sole managing conservator. The jury answered \"yes\" to the first question and \"no\" to the second, effectively making Georgulas the sole managing conservator.\n\nThe judge is expected to make a final verdict on the details of the new arrangement on Wednesday. Benjamin Albritton, who compiled a report for the court on the case, had advocated for the \"affirmation\" approach but recommended the court prohibit Georgulas from initiating a medical transition without Younger's approval. The judge's verdict on Thursday may include Albritton's recommendation and maintain a similar arrangement to the current one.\n\nYounger has the option to appeal the jury's decision, but doing so would be a costly and time-consuming process that could take a year. By that time, Younger is concerned that James could begin puberty and be treated with puberty blockers.\n\nThis piece has been updated to reflect that the verdict has been moved to Thursday instead of today. The time change was made after publication.",

However, the administration has expressed its \"appalled\" response to these recent developments. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda's newest ally has claimed another American in captivity and has issued a threat to kill him if the U.S. does not halt its airstrike operations.\n\nFormer CIA Director Mike Morell argued that the beheading of James Foley should not deter the U.S. from taking the fight to the enemy. In fact, Morell suggested that the U.S. should accelerate its efforts against ISIL. \"The definition of terrorism is political violence,\" Morell stated, \"so we should mark this date down because this is ISIL's first terrorist attack against the United States.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a potential presidential candidate, strongly condemned ISIL in a statement today. \"The brutal execution of American journalist James Foley by ISIL is the latest example of the evil and barbarism of these terrorists,\" Rubio said. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the Foley family and with other Western hostages who are still being held.\"\n\nRubio further stated that ISIL's barbaric beheading of a defenseless hostage is the clearest indication to date that ISIL has declared war on the United States, the American people, and freedom-loving people everywhere. He expressed concern that, despite the overwhelming evidence that ISIL poses a fundamentally evil and dangerous terrorist threat to the U.S., President Obama continues to appear unwilling to take the necessary actions to confront ISIL and communicate the threat ISIL poses to the American people and to American way of life.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to address the alleged beheading of James Wright Foley and its implications in a press conference today.

    " Title: Anonymous Call to British Reporter 25 Minutes Before JFK Assassination Revealed in Declassified CIA File\n\nA declassified CIA file released on Thursday has revealed an anonymous phone call made to a senior reporter at a British newspaper 25 minutes before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The call, made on November 26, 1963, alerted the reporter to \"some big news\" and instructed him to contact the American Embassy in London.\n\nAccording to the document, penned by former CIA Deputy Director James Angleton, the caller simply stated that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy for \"some big news\" and then hung up. The reporter, who remained unidentified in the report, had never received such a call before, and MI5, Britain's Security Service, described him as a \"sound and loyal person with no security record.\"\n\nFollowing Kennedy's death, the reporter informed the Cambridge police about the call, and the police subsequently notified MI5. The report states that the call was made approximately 25 minutes before the President was shot.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, citing potential harm to national security. He placed these files under a six-month review while releasing 2,800 others to meet a deadline mandated by law.\n\nThe documents that were released show federal agents actively pursuing leads and managing worldwide rumors in the days following the assassination on November 22, 1963. The materials also shed light on the Kennedy administration's covert activities, such as its efforts to destabilize Fidel Castro's government in Cuba.\n\nA CIA spokesperson told Fox News that the agency had released all but 18,000 of its more than 87,000 documents related to the assassination, with the remaining records to be made available. The spokesperson added that the outstanding documents contained redactions to protect information that, if disclosed, could harm national security, including the names of CIA assets, current and former CIA officers, and specific intelligence methods and partnerships still relevant to national security today.",
    " Title: GAO Report: Trump Violated Law in Freezing Ukraine Aid, According to Watchdog\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a federal watchdog has concluded that President Donald Trump violated the law when he froze assistance funds for Ukraine last year, according to a report unveiled on Thursday. The White House has maintained that Trump was acting within his legal authority.\n\nThe report, released by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), states that Trump's decision to freeze military aid appropriated by Congress is at the heart of the ongoing impeachment proceedings against the president. The proceedings are set to move from the Democrat-controlled House to the majority-Republican Senate this week.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have accused Trump of abusing his office by withholding hundreds of millions in assistance in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) blocked the Defense Department from spending money designated by Congress on July 25, citing a pending policy decision, according to OMB General Counsel Mark Paoletta. The hold was lifted on Sept. 12.\n\nHowever, the GAO report states that a 1974 law that governs budget procedure within the government \"does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.\" Thomas Armstrong, general counsel for the GAO, made this assertion.\n\nDocuments and testimony released during and after House impeachment hearings revealed that some administration officials had raised concerns that the Ukraine hold might have violated the Impoundment Control Act, a law that designates the ways in which Congress has the power of the purse. Under the Impoundment Control Act, it is illegal for OMB to withhold money that has been appropriated by Congress and signed into law without first alerting Congress.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, asked the GAO to assess Trump's decisions to freeze the Ukraine aid. Van Hollen stated that the report vindicated Congress's decision to impeach Trump.\n\n\"We now have a GAO decision stating conclusively that the Trump administration violated the law,\" Van Hollen told NPR. \"We know the president ordered that violation of law. And it's all the more important that Republican senators support a fair trial,\" he added, emphasizing the need for all relevant documents and witnesses in the Senate trial.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposes the introduction of fresh witnesses or evidence into a Senate trial, arguing that the Senate's role is to assess the House's fact-finding, not to conduct new investigations. Senators are expected to vote on this question, and it is unclear whether there might be sufficient support from enough Republicans to bring in new evidence or witnesses.\n\nAfter the release of the GAO report, the OMB issued a statement disagreeing with the findings. \"OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the president's priorities and with the law,\" said OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel.\n\nIn a letter to GAO in December, OMB lawyer Paoletta argued that the holdup of the Ukraine aid was a simple \"programmatic delay\" and therefore did not require prior notice to Congress. Paoletta also argued that the Defense Department's general counsel never told his office that it would have any problems spending the money before the funds expired at the end of the fiscal year in September.\n\nHowever, national security online forum Just Security reported in early January that Defense Department emails showed repeated warnings from the department to OMB that the delays put its ability to distribute the aid at risk.",
    " Title: Gillette's New Commercial: A Call for Better Behavior or Cultural Marxism?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, Gillette, the shaving company, released a new commercial this week that challenges men to behave better towards women and each other. However, the commercial, which encourages men to reject toxic masculinity and promote respectful behavior, has been criticized by some on the right as a product of \"mainstream radicalized feminism\" and \"Cultural Marxism.\"\n\nCandace Owens, a conservative pundit, wrote that the commercial is \"the product of mainstream radicalized feminism\u2014and emblematic of Cultural Marxism.\" Right-leaning author Michael Knowles accused Gillette of \"granting the premises of SJW jackals.\" Ben Shapiro, over at National Review, claimed that the company was \"kowtowing to leftist social priorities\" in order to \"inoculate [ itself ] from the woke scolds of the Left.\"\n\nThese strong claims\u2014cultural Marxism! SJW jackals! Leftist social priorities!\u2014should strike anyone who actually watches the ad as fairly ridiculous. The ad invokes \"toxic masculinity,\" an ill-defined concept sometimes deployed by the campus left in overbroad ways. But most of the ad depicts men deciding not to bully each other, harass women, or commit violence. Are these really \"leftist social priorities\"? Do conservatives really wish to portray them as such?\n\nShapiro's catchphrase is \"facts do not care about your feelings,\" which he deploys\u2014often correctly\u2014to chide the left for having rendered unsayable something that is true: there are generally some differences between men and women. But this seems to be a case where the right's feelings are getting in the way of facts. Men commit a lot more violence than women, sexual harassment is undeniably a problem in many workplaces, and boys should be raised not to attack each other.\n\nIt's true that not all men engage in violence, sexual harassment, and bullying\u2014and on the flip side, plenty of women are abusers. Collectivist assumptions are obnoxious\u2014and anathema to libertarian principles\u2014whether they are deployed against men, women, white people, black people, etc. Certainly, some on the left are guilty of going this route (as are many who claim to speak for the right). But the ad never said that all men are bad. It never argued that masculinity is always and everywhere a dangerous ideal. It made a very modest statement\u2014treat people better\u2014in hopes of selling more razors to people who agree. Again, why is this bad?\n\nTo his credit, Shapiro makes perfectly legitimate points in the rest of his column about the importance of young men having strong male role models in their lives. If you want to raise a generation of men who will treat women well, act as protectors rather than victimizers, and become the bedrock for a stable society, you need more masculinity, not less. In fact, a recent study from Stanford, Harvard, and the Census Bureau found that high levels of father presence in local communities may matter even more than having a father in the home directly; the study explained, \"black boys who grow up in areas with high father presence are also significantly less likely to be incarcerated.\"\n\nExactly right: young guys need to learn from men who treat women well and act as protectors rather than victimizers, which\u2026is exactly what the Gillette ad called on men to do. People are free to associate with whatever brand they want, so if Gillette's so-called virtue signaling bothers someone that much, that person may go ahead and buy razors elsewhere. But it would be a shame if the right started boycotting companies for taking the position that maybe hurting people is bad. Is owning the libs really that important?",
    " Title: The Unforeseen Impact of News Coverage: A Study on the Boston Marathon Bombings and Mental Health\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a team of researchers led by Alison Holman from the University of California, Irvine, found themselves in an unusual position. They were in possession of data on the mental wellbeing of nearly 5,000 individuals, collected just before the tragic event. In an effort to understand the impact of the bombings on mental health, they decided to compare the data before and after the incident.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, revealed an unexpected finding. While it was intuitive that being physically present for or personally affected by a terrorist incident would negatively impact mental health, the researchers found that the group most affected were those who consumed six or more hours of news coverage per day in the week following the bombings.\n\nInterestingly, being in close proximity to the explosions or knowing someone who was injured or killed did not predict high levels of acute stress as much as excessive news consumption. Holman, the lead researcher, described this as a \"big 'aha' moment\" for the team, emphasizing the profound impact news can have on individuals, far beyond the mere transmission of facts.\n\nNews coverage, it seems, is more than just a source of information. It can seep into our subconscious, influencing our attitudes, shaping our views, and potentially impacting our health. The study suggests that news consumption can lead to miscalculations of certain risks, influence our views of foreign countries, and even affect the health of entire economies.\n\nMoreover, the study found that the emotional fallout of news coverage can impact our physical health, increasing the risk of heart attacks and developing health problems years later. The study's findings underscore the need for news consumers to be mindful of their consumption habits and the potential impact on their mental and physical wellbeing.\n\nCrucially, the study suggests that even a few hours of news consumption each day can have a significant impact, far beyond what one might expect. This finding highlights the importance of news literacy and the need for consumers to be aware of the potential consequences of their news consumption habits.",
    " Title: Red-State Democrats Struggle to Balance Tax Vote, Re-election Bids\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent tax-cut bill's passage, one-party lines, several red-state Democrats are grappling with the political implications of their votes. These Democrats, who face re-election battles next year in states President Trump won by significant margins, are hoping voters will not penalize them for their stance on the tax bill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has consistently attempted to find common ground with Republicans for President Trump's agenda, could not support the tax bill this time. In an interview on West Virginia talk radio, Manchin acknowledged the potential benefits for the state's middle class but expressed concerns about the bill's focus on corporate tax cuts.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, another red-state Democrat, voted against the bill, framing her decision as a disappointment with the plan's corporate-friendly nature and a betrayal of the principles Trump originally proposed. However, her opposition has been met with confusion from some voters, such as Dennis Hugo, a self-described Libertarian, who expressed difficulty understanding her stance.\n\nIn Indiana, Sen. Joe Donnelly met with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence over the tax bill and expressed a willingness to partner with Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump administration. However, he criticized the bill produced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan as being the opposite of what he and the president had discussed.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who previously expressed openness to voting for the bill, ultimately voted against it due to the additional $1.5 trillion in deficits the tax cuts would create. However, some voters in her state question the validity of this opposition, particularly regarding the doubling of the death tax, a provision that drew attention in agricultural North Dakota.\n\nDaryl Lies, president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, questioned the necessity of taxing events like death and expressed support for the bill's increased deduction for the full purchase of equipment, which he believes will benefit local farmers. Lies also expressed little concern about the added debt, citing enhanced crop insurance during that time.\n\nAs the 2018 midterm elections approach, red-state Democrats are walking a fine line between their party loyalty and the desire to appeal to voters in states that supported President Trump. The tax bill's passage without any Democratic support has left these Democrats hoping voters will understand their rationale for their votes, even as President Trump has criticized their opposition.",
    " Title: GOP Senators Probe Hunter Biden's Business Dealings Amidst Impeachment Acquittal\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), have continued their investigation into potential conflicts of interest involving Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China, following President Donald Trump's acquittal by the Senate on articles of impeachment for his own conduct in Ukraine.\n\nIn a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray on Wednesday, the senators sought clarification on whether Hunter Biden used government-sponsored travel to conduct private business and details of his travel records. The senators have previously requested records related to Hunter Biden from the State and Treasury Departments.\n\nThe investigation comes as Republicans have sought to shift focus from Trump's alleged improper pressure on Ukraine to conduct investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, for which there is no evidence. The GOP claims that Joe Biden pushed out a former Ukrainian prosecutor to quell a probe into the Ukrainian energy company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. However, the former vice president's position was that the prosecutor was not tough enough on corruption cases in the nation, a view shared by international leaders and anti-corruption groups.\n\nDemocrats have argued that Trump only wanted investigations to damage Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while Trump's legal team argued in the Senate trial that the president had legitimate reasons to be concerned.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also stated his intention to pursue the Bidens, stating that the day of reckoning is coming for congressional and Senate oversight of Joe Biden. Graham hopes the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will call witnesses, including Hunter Biden, to testify about the matter in the coming weeks.\n\nThe former vice president has dismissed all allegations as conspiracy theories, but acknowledged that Hunter Biden's role created a \"bad image.\" Joe Biden stated on Monday, \"No one's found anything wrong with his dealings with Ukraine except they say it sets a bad image.\"\n\nThis investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings adds another layer to the ongoing political drama surrounding the Bidens and their ties to Ukraine. The outcome of this investigation remains to be seen, but it is clear that the political landscape in Washington continues to be shaped by the ongoing investigations and allegations.",
    " Title: USCIS Director Francis Cissna Resigns, to be Replaced by Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Francis Cissna, has resigned from his post on Friday, following a request from President Donald Trump, according to his resignation letter. Cissna will be succeeded by former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, as per a source familiar with the situation.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Cissna emphasized his commitment to enforcing the rule of law and laying the groundwork for effective immigration reform during his tenure. \"We are the government servants charged with lawfully, efficiently, and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits, while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our nation\u2019s values,\" Cissna wrote. \"I have always been and will remain keenly aware of these charges and your diligence in fulfilling our mission.\"\n\nCissna's departure from the USCIS has been in the works for several weeks, as Trump has sought to reshuffle his immigration officials. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Ronald Vitiello, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also left their posts last month. Republican lawmakers had urged the president to retain Cissna, but White House advisor Stephen Miller had sought to remove him for several weeks.\n\nRumors of Cuccinelli's selection to a top immigration post surfaced earlier this week. Cuccinelli led the charge among the Republican National Convention to back Sen. Ted Cruz's nomination in 2016. However, members of Trump's inner circle told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this week that the president had put their past differences aside and had come to admire Cuccinelli.\n\nUSCIS, which oversees legal immigration and has traditionally defended it, has been a key player in the Trump administration's hardline approach to immigration under Cissna's leadership. Cissna has overseen the significant reduction of the country's refugee program, the creation of a \"denaturalization task force\" aimed at stripping citizenship from those who committed fraud, and a change in policy to make it easier for visas to be denied.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine in September, Cissna stated that he was not driven by anti-immigrant sentiment but rather a \"strong commitment to the law, and to the rule of law.\"\n\nCuccinelli's appointment to the USCIS marks a continuation of the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration. The new director is expected to maintain and further the administration's policies on immigration, as the USCIS continues to play a significant role in enforcing these policies.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Criticize Obama's Surveillance Program Review, Accuse White House of Reactive Policymaking\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, congressional leaders have criticized President Obama for his plan to review and potentially alter government surveillance programs, with lawmakers taking aim at the White House's perceived reactive approach to national security versus privacy debates. The criticism stems not from the proposed changes, but from the perceived perpetual game of catch-up, with the national security versus privacy debate being driven not by the administration but by figures such as National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nRep. Michael T. McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, voiced his concerns on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" stating, \"I think Snowden came out and leaked this information, and the White House has been backtracking ever since. When the story initially broke, the president went undercover. He finally came out last Friday trying to come up with ways to salvage the program by window dressing. The problem fundamentally is he\u2019s failed to explain these programs which are lawful, which have saved lives, which have stopped terrorist plots.\"\n\nPresident Obama's remarks, made before the first family's vacation, were intended to address concerns that the federal government is eroding Americans' Fourth Amendment rights. Among other things, the president asked Congress to review portions of the Patriot Act that allow the NSA and other agencies to monitor telephone records and gather other forms of data.\n\nThe depth of these programs was first revealed by Mr. Snowden, the former government contractor who was granted asylum in Russia. He has been charged by the Justice Department with espionage and other offenses.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the Patriot Act, Mr. Obama also proposed putting privacy advocates in the courtroom to argue against the government's case for search warrants and enhanced snooping efforts. He also said there must be greater transparency around these programs, an effort to restore skeptical Americans' trust in their leaders.\n\nThe White House has maintained that it welcomes the debate and that the president intends to lead a national conversation on the best way to balance security and privacy. However, critics argue that the administration has fallen into the trap of reacting to events, such as the Snowden leaks, and the public pressure that results.\n\nRep. Peter T. King (R-NY), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" \"He\u2019s allowed the Edward Snowdens and the others of the world to dominate the media, and now we have people who actually think the NSA is spying on people, is listening to our phone calls, is reading our emails.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, lawmakers' voices have become louder in the larger debate. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-SC) joined Republicans last month in voting to defund NSA surveillance programs. He said he did so not because he doesn't trust the president but because he thinks Congress must be more involved.\n\n\"The president spoke out on this issue long before Snowden. And I was very comfortable with the president\u2019s position on this,\" he said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"It\u2019s just that every now and then, you cast a vote in order to let your constituents know, and for your colleagues to know, exactly how you feel about a situation, and sometimes, let the White House know that this is something that we can not allow you to have just a blank check on.\"\n\nMr. Obama's proposed changes have also drawn criticism from outside Washington, including from Edward Snowden's father, Lon. \"What I\u2019ve seen is much political theater,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I was disappointed in the president\u2019s press conference. I believe that\u2019s driven by his clear understanding that the American people are absolutely unhappy with what they learned. Much of what he suggested is superficial.\"\n\nLon Snowden and his attorney, Bruce Fein, confirmed that they have secured visas and will travel to Russia soon to meet with Edward Snowden.\n\nThe debate sparked by Edward Snowden's revelations and the national debate they have spawned underscores a deeper problem in American society, some lawmakers say. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said Sunday that he doesn't disagree with any of the reform ideas that the president laid out last week but that efforts also must focus on the broader goal of restoring public confidence in elected leaders.\n\n\"There\u2019s a careful balance here between preserving our assets and capabilities and making sure the American people are convinced that their privacy is not being violated,\" Mr. McCain said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Right now, there is kind of a generational change. Young Americans do not trust this government. Without trust in government, you can\u2019t do a lot of things.\"\n\nMr. McCain cited the disparate reactions to the Snowden leaks as an example of the generation gap. \"There\u2019s a young generation who believes he\u2019s some kind of Jason Bourne,\" he said.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Conflict Escalates as Trump Imposes Tariffs on $200 Billion of Chinese Goods\n\nThe U.S.-China trade conflict is intensifying as President Donald Trump prepares to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese-made products, ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators. The new tariffs, announced on Tuesday, will raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from China.\n\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or respond with retaliatory measures. President Xi Jinping, facing political pressure to appear tough, has already imposed retaliatory duties on U.S. products, including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon. Matching the latest U.S. tariffs could force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps, such as canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts, and putting up regulatory hurdles.\n\nTrump has framed his trade actions as necessary to protect American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices. \"Other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses,\" Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels, where he's attending a NATO summit. \"I will open things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!\"\n\nThe trade conflict could have significant economic consequences. Economists warn that a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years. The S&P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated on Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would retaliate against the U.S. tariffs. There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs. Beijing \"never yields to threat or blackmail\" and will retaliate against the \"groundless\" tariffs, China's Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe trade conflict is causing political divisions within the U.S. Republican Party. House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady warned of \"a long, multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe.\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch called the new levies \"reckless\" and not \"targeted.\" Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, expressed concern about the trade spat with China and the uncertainty it's creating among farmers and businesses in his state.\n\nThe U.S. is demanding more systemic change from China, including rolling back its \"Made-in-China 2025\" program, a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries. The trade conflict poses an existential concern for Xi, whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success.",
    " Title: House GOP Budget Proposal: A New Path for Middle-Class Families and Small Businesses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from the current administration's proposed budget, the newly passed GOP House budget aims to provide new opportunities for middle-class families and small businesses, according to House Speaker John Boehner. In a column for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Boehner outlined the pro-growth, balanced budget as a solution to the spending problem under President Barack Obama, a catalyst for job creation, and a step towards a simpler and fairer tax code.\n\nBoehner criticized the president's budget, which he described as increasing spending by 65 percent over 10 years, imposing more than $2 trillion in new taxes on working families, and adding $8.5 trillion in new debt to the nation's future generations. He argued that many middle-class families are currently experiencing a decrease in earnings, high energy prices, rising food prices, and a challenging job market under the Obama administration.\n\nThe Republican budget, Boehner contended, addresses the spending issue directly while safeguarding programs like Medicare and Social Security. The House also voted overwhelmingly to replace the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula with a system that rewards quality and innovation in Medicare. This permanent SGR solution, Boehner stated, will ensure seniors' access to healthcare, strengthen Medicare, and provide long-term savings for taxpayers.\n\nBoehner concluded by expressing optimism for the House's first 100 days of 2015, promising continued focus on the American people's needs and a commitment to making decisions that benefit the country, not just the easy ones.",
    " Title: Manhunt Intensifies for Berlin Christmas Market Attack Suspect Anis Amri\n\nArticle:\n\nA manhunt is currently underway across Europe for the suspect behind Monday's deadly lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market. German prosecutors have identified the suspect as Anis Amri, a 23-year-old Tunisian national. Authorities warn that he could be armed and dangerous.\n\nThe residence permit of the suspect was found in the cab of the lorry, and reports suggest he may have been injured in a struggle with the lorry driver, who was found dead in the cab. The attack resulted in 12 fatalities, with 49 others injured.\n\nPolice are searching a migrant shelter in the Emmerich area of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the suspect's permit was issued. Chancellor Angela Merkel has convened her security cabinet to discuss the investigation into the attack.\n\nIn another development, the German cabinet has approved plans to allow more video surveillance of public places. Anis Amri is reported to have travelled to Italy in 2012 and then to Germany in 2015, where he applied for asylum and was granted temporary leave to stay in April of this year.\n\nRalf Jaeger, the minister of interior of North Rhine-Westphalia, stated that the claim for asylum had been rejected in June but the necessary papers for deportation had not been ready. Security agencies had exchanged information about Anis Amri with the Joint Counter-Terrorism Centre in November 2016.\n\nTunisia, Mr. Jaeger said, had denied Anis Amri was its citizen, so the authorities had to wait for temporary passport documentation from Tunisia. Judicial sources suggest the suspect was monitored in Berlin between March and September on suspicion of planning a robbery to pay for automatic weapons for use in an attack.\n\nThe suspect is reported to have moved within the circle of an Islamist preacher, Ahmad Abdelazziz A, known as Abu Walaa, who was arrested in November. Anis Amri's father and security sources told a Tunisian radio station that he had served four years in an Italian prison over a fire at a school and was also sentenced to five years in prison in Tunisia in absentia for aggravated theft with violence.\n\nAn earlier suspect, a Pakistani asylum seeker, was released from German custody on Tuesday, with officials stating there was no evidence to link him to the attack. The only confirmed death is that of Polish lorry driver Lukasz Urban, who appears to have fought the attacker before dying of stab and gunshot wounds.\n\nPolish citizen Lukasz Urban is feared dead, while Italian expatriate Fabrizia di Lorenzo, 31, from Sulmona near L'Aquila, is also feared dead. A woman from Neuss, near the west German city of Duesseldorf, is believed to be among the dead, while her son, aged 40, is among the injured.\n\nThe German authorities have asked the family of Israeli woman Dalia Elyakim, missing since the attack, for DNA samples to help identify her. An Israeli man, Rami Elyakim, was seriously injured. A Spanish student, 21-year-old Inaki Ellakuria, survived the attack with leg injuries.\n\nThere appears to be evidence that, despite being stabbed, Mr. Urban wrestled his hijacker for the steering wheel. The post-mortem examination suggests that Mr. Urban survived up until the attack and was shot dead when the truck came to a halt. No gun has been recovered. Police say they are acting on hundreds of tips from the public and are examining DNA traces from the cab of the truck.\n\nThe IS group claimed the attack through its self-styled news agency, stating it was \"in response to calls to target nationals of the coalition countries.\" Prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters that the style of attack and the choice of target suggested Islamic extremism.",
    " Title: Job Market Takes a Sudden Downturn in December, Raising Concerns for Economists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the job market experienced a significant slowdown in December, with the economy adding only 74,000 jobs, according to the latest government data. This figure represents the weakest month for job growth since January 2011 and is significantly lower than the expected 193,000 jobs that economists had forecasted.\n\nFor the entire year of 2013, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, which is on par with 2012's gains. Some economists attribute December's weak job gains to a potential fluke, citing other robust economic indicators. They anticipate that the government will revise the numbers higher in the coming months.\n\nTim Hopper, chief economist for TIAA-CREF, stated, \"Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire, extending hours and laying off fewer people.\" Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, added, \"Let's not panic. It's not a horrible year, all things considered.\"\n\nThe government also noted that \"unusually cold weather in parts of the country\" could have impacted construction jobs, as this sector lost 16,000 jobs in December.\n\nIn addition to the lower job growth, the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December. However, the decrease was primarily due to workers leaving the labor force. These job market dropouts could be engaged in various activities, such as retirement, enrollment in educational programs, or caring for relatives. However, many have given up hope of finding work.\n\nCurrently, only 62.8% of the adult population is participating in the labor market, which is the lowest level since 1978. During the job market's 2007 heyday, unemployment was under 5%, but in the two years that followed, the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs. To this day, not all those jobs have returned.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, economist with the Economic Policy Institute, stated, \"We're going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time.\"\n\nSeveral individuals who have been unemployed for an extended period have shared their stories with CNNMoney. Jamie May, a former senior manager for a corporate housing company, has been job hunting for over a year. She has submitted applications for positions across the country and has even indicated a willingness to take jobs in the $30,000 to $40,000 range.\n\nFred Royal, a former administrative assistant for a grocery chain, lost his job in March and has encountered the same challenges in interviews. \"Many have said they think I will leave for a better paying job,\" he said. \"Better paying job? I can't even get one job.\"\n\nBoth May and Royal were among the 1.3 million Americans who received their final check in federal unemployment benefits last week after Congress agreed on a budget that did not include the recession-era program. Democrats are pushing for an extension of the program, but Republicans insist on finding a way to pay for it through cost-cutting elsewhere.\n\nThe ongoing tension between Washington policymakers, as they haggle over budget cuts versus aid to the still fragile economy, exemplifies the ongoing challenges facing the job market. While Congress has primarily focused on reducing government spending, the Federal Reserve has been injecting trillions of dollars into the economy in an attempt to help the job market.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke will end his second term at the central bank later this month without reaching his goal of \"full employment.\" In a speech last week, Bernanke acknowledged, \"The recovery clearly remains incomplete.\" He blamed part of the problem on government policy, stating, \"Excessively tight near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive.\"\n\nThe federal government has cut 98,000 jobs over the past three years, not including the Postal Service, which is independently funded but has also been slashing jobs.

    " Title: Super Typhoon Mangkhut Slams into China's Guangdong Province, Causing Devastation and Loss of Life\n\nArticle:\n\nA powerful super typhoon, named Mangkhut, made landfall in China's Guangdong province on Sunday, following its destructive path through Hong Kong and Macau, and potentially causing more than 50 deaths in the Philippines.\n\nPacking winds of over 200 kph (125 mph) at its peak, tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year. Its strength surpasses that of Hurricane Florence, which reached maximum sustained winds of 150 kph (90 mph) when it struck North Carolina in the United States on Friday.\n\nThe eye of Mangkhut, named after the Thai mangosteen fruit, skirted approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Hong Kong, but the city was still subjected to the typhoon's swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds. Hong Kong raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal mid-morning, as ferocious winds uprooted trees, shattered windows in buildings, and caused some structures to sway.\n\nIn the Philippines, the death toll from Mangkhut's impact is estimated to exceed 50, with most fatalities occurring in landslides in or near mountainous areas of the Cordillera region. As of Sunday evening, 33 deaths and 56 missing persons have been reported, but the number of casualties may rise as search and rescue operations continue.\n\nIn Macau, which temporarily halted casino gambling late on Saturday, there was significant flooding of up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet), with some people requiring rescue from their homes using rubber dinghies. Around 20,000 Macau households also experienced a power blackout, according to local media.\n\nThe typhoon, known as the \"King of Storms\" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5 p.m. local time. Ports, oil refineries, and industrial plants in the area have been shut down, and power has been reduced in some areas as a precaution. In Shenzhen, the electricity supply to over 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday.\n\nMangkhut is expected to continue its northwesterly track, bringing heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday. The storm is forecast to weaken into a tropical depression when it reaches southwestern Yunnan province in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nThe typhoon has raised concerns about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for about a tenth of national output at approximately 1 million tonnes. More than 2.45 million people have been relocated, over 48,000 fishing boats have been recalled to port, and work at more than 29,000 construction sites has been suspended.\n\nState television showed scenes of crashing waves, inundated streets, and trees bent by the strong winds as Mangkhut unleashed its power. Shenzhen airport, closed since midnight, will remain shut until 8 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have also been canceled in Guangzhou and the island of Hainan, China's southernmost province. High winds and swells have affected Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services, and canceling over 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 meters (24 feet) were reported in the Taiwan Strait, according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\nTraveling at 30 kph (19 mph), Mangkhut is expected to continue its destructive path, bringing heavy rain and winds to the affected regions in the coming days.",
    " Title: Physician David Nathan Disagrees with David Frum on Marijuana Legalization for Adults, Advocates Regulation Over Prohibition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent op-ed for CNN.com, conservative political commentator David Frum argued against the legalization of marijuana, citing potential harm, particularly to young people and the psychiatrically ill. Clinical psychiatrist David Nathan, however, disagrees with Frum's stance, asserting that marijuana should be legal for adults and regulated similarly to alcohol.\n\nNathan, who shares Frum's concerns about the drug's impact on young people and the mentally ill, believes that the negative legal consequences of marijuana use are far more damaging than the medical consequences. Frum, he argues, is attempting to hide marijuana from young people by maintaining its illegality, which Nathan contends only elevates its status as a forbidden fruit.\n\nInstead, Nathan proposes a more open approach, advocating for the legalization of marijuana for adults and educating children about the actual dangers of recreational use from a young age. \"Throughout my career as a clinical psychiatrist, I have seen lives ruined by drugs like cocaine, painkillers, and alcohol,\" Nathan says. \"I have also borne witness to the devastation brought upon cannabis users -- almost never by abuse of the drug, but by a justice system that chooses a sledgehammer to kill a weed.\"\n\nNathan points out that alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, caffeine, and refined sugar are among the most commonly used, potentially habit-forming recreational substances. While all are best left out of our daily diets, only marijuana is illegal, though alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful. In several respects, even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation's health than pot.\n\nAlcohol, Nathan explains, is associated with pancreatitis, gastritis, cirrhosis, permanent dementia, physiological dependence, and fatal withdrawal. In healthy but reckless teens and young adults, it is frighteningly easy to consume a lethal dose of alcohol, but it is essentially impossible to do so with marijuana. Furthermore, alcohol causes severe impairment of judgment, which results in violence, risky sexual behavior, and more use of hard drugs.\n\nNathan also addresses the argument that cannabis is a gateway to opioids and other dangerous drugs. He contends that the illegal purchase of marijuana exposes consumers to dealers who push the hard stuff. Given marijuana's popularity in this country, the consumption of more dangerous drugs could actually decrease if pot were purchased at a liquor store rather than on the street corner where heroin and crack are sold.\n\nAnother pressing reason to legalize and regulate marijuana, according to Nathan, is the potential for adulteration of black-market cannabis and the substitution of even more dangerous copycat compounds. These compounds, with street names like K2 and Spice, are proliferating, and the Drug Enforcement Administration struggles to combat them. Natural marijuana poses much less danger than synthetic cannabinoids -- legal or otherwise.\n\nNathan concludes by questioning the origins of marijuana prohibition, which he attributes to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, which in 1937 pushed through laws ending the growth, trade, and consumption of all forms of cannabis, including the inert but commercially useful hemp plant. America's ban on the so-called \"Weed of Madness\" was based on bad science and fabricated stories of violence perpetrated under the influence. Nathan suggests that America can fix this mess through marijuana legalization, regulating the cannabis trade as they do with alcohol and tobacco, monitoring production for safety and purity, controlling where it is sold, taxing all aspects of marijuana production and consumption, and redirecting resources from punishment to prevention.",
    " Title: Donald Trump's Entrance into the 2016 Presidential Race: A Look at the Billionaire Businessman and Reality TV Star\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been widely anticipated, Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate developer and television personality, has officially entered the 2016 presidential race. Trump, who turns 69 on June 14, made his announcement two days prior, joining a diverse field of candidates that has been described as the most extensive in recent history.\n\nKnown for his high national name recognition, Trump's career spans various industries, including real estate development and television. His signature properties include Trump Plaza in Manhattan, golf resorts in Florida, and casinos in Atlantic City. He is also recognized for his successful run as a reality TV star on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nTrump has made occasional forays into national politics over the past two decades. In 1999, he was among several contenders for the Reform Party nomination, following the decline of President Bill Clinton's term. Although he withdrew from the contest, he expressed interest in seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012, and remained a vocal critic of President Obama's policies during those years. He also frequently appeared with other candidates, such as Sarah Palin.\n\nTrump was a prominent figure in the so-called birther movement, questioning President Obama's eligibility for the office based on allegations of foreign birth. Despite the release of definitive documents confirming Obama's birth in Hawaii in 1961, Trump continued to express doubts about the president's citizenship.\n\nBorn in Queens, New York, Trump was sent to the New York Military Academy at the age of 13 to learn discipline. He later attended Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance. He then went into business with his father, a developer of middle-class housing, but later focused on Manhattan and participated in higher-risk, higher-reward projects.\n\nTrump has been polling at around 5% among Republicans, a figure that would qualify him for the Fox News debate on August 6, which will feature the top 10 candidates based on an average of national polls. Although his actual net worth has been a subject of dispute, Forbes magazine estimates it to be $4.1 billion, ranking him 133rd among American billionaires and 388th globally.\n\nIn 2000, Trump received 15,311 votes in the California Reform Party primary, despite not actively campaigning for the position. His television show, The Apprentice, was a hit from its introduction in 2004, and he has been a frequent guest on talk shows, including The Late Show With David Letterman.\n\nTrump's business career had a significant breakthrough when he was just 34, with the acquisition of an option to buy the old Commodore Hotel near Manhattan's Grand Central Station. This property was later redesigned and became the Grand Hyatt, a major success after extensive restoration of Grand Central itself. Trump also bought and renovated the iconic Plaza Hotel at the southeast corner of Central Park and the Barbizon at the southwest corner.\n\nTrump has been married three times and has five children. His three children from his first marriage\u2014Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric\u2014are now in their 30s and involved in the Trump Organization businesses. Trump and his first wife, Ivana, were married from 1977 to 1991 but continued to appear in advertisements together, such as for Pizza Hut, even after their separation, joking about how they would split the pizza.\n\nOn Tuesday, after his political rally, Trump is expected to release a summary of assets totaling $9 billion, according to the Washington Post. This figure includes valuations on his real estate holdings.",
    " Title: The Nation's Aging Water Infrastructure: A Hidden Crisis Beyond Flint\n\nArticle:\n\nThe water crisis in Flint, Michigan, serves as a stark reminder of the deep-rooted issues plaguing the nation's water infrastructure. The aging water systems in the United States, serving over 300 million people, are based on rusting, leaky pipes and outdated plans that, if not addressed, will have long-lasting and devastating effects on communities across the country.\n\nThe Flint crisis, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit's system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure, is a grim premonition of potential disasters lurking in other communities. It is incomprehensible that in one of the most developed nations, families and young children are being exposed to the toxic effects of lead. The negligence exhibited by water supply officials is alarming, with the failure to recognize the danger posed by the lead-contaminated water flowing through a major American city.\n\nLead, a harmful compound, can have severe and detrimental effects on the developing brain and body. In 1978, a successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products led to a new law, following the discovery that small children could ingest lead-laden paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter in 1991, requiring water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.\n\nOnce lead enters the human body, it attaches itself to cells, accumulating in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. The most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities, and other neurological deficits. The damage caused by chronic lead exposure is, for the most part, irreversible.\n\nThe Obama administration's plan to appoint Dr. Nicole Lurie as a \"czar\" to address the Flint crisis is a step in the right direction. However, it is crucial that Lurie and others evaluate other areas of the United States where the population is most susceptible to a disaster such as this. The government's failure in Flint underscores the urgent need for proactive measures to protect other communities from similar crises. The nation's water infrastructure requires immediate attention and investment to ensure the safety and health of its citizens.",
    " Title: Professor Vanessa Tyson Accuses Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of Sexual Assault\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Vanessa Tyson, a college professor from California, accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) of sexual assault. The alleged incident occurred in 2004 at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\nTyson, a professor of politics at Scripps College in California, stated, \"What began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault.\" She claimed that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nFairfax, in a statement earlier Wednesday, maintained that his interaction with Tyson was consensual. He said, \"At no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions.\"\n\nTyson contradicted Fairfax's denial, stating, \"I can not believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. To be very clear, I did not want to engage in oral sex with Mr. Fairfax and I never gave any form of consent.\"\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTyson said she did not tell anyone about the incident for years. She approached The Washington Post with her story last year, but the paper did not publish it due to a lack of corroboration.\n\nTyson is represented by Katz, Marshall & Banks, the same law firm that represented Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of assault last year. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe allegation against Fairfax surfaced after a photo was released Friday of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's (D) medical school yearbook page that pictured a man dressed in blackface and another dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) also admitted to using blackface as a teenager on Wednesday, deepening the leadership crisis in the Commonwealth.",
    " Title: Donald Trump's Impact on the Republican Party: A Shift in the Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, is challenging the traditional narrative of the Grand Old Party (GOP) by exposing what he perceives as the delusional and incompetent leadership within the party. The GOP, according to Trump, has failed to deliver significant results despite a 15-year-long war, two trillion dollars in funding, and the sacrifice of thousands of American lives.\n\nFor years, politicians have promised to reform Washington, D.C., but have failed to deliver on their promises. The Obama administration, with its stronghold on the House of Representatives and Senate, has been a source of frustration for many Americans. The media's portrayal of political events has been met with skepticism, with Trump choosing to believe that the media's inaccuracies are unintentional rather than malicious.\n\nThe candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been criticized for their inability to distinguish themselves from each other, allowing Trump to maintain a strong lead in the race. This dynamic is a microcosm of the stagnation that has plagued Washington for the past 8 to 16 years, with politicians prioritizing personal status over the common good.\n\nIn just nine months, Trump has managed to disrupt the political status quo, effectively ending the Jeb Bush campaign and outmaneuvering his competitors. His unconventional approach has earned him a clear path to the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump's impact on the political landscape is undeniable. From coast to coast, he has garnered widespread support, exposing the GOP's perceived flaws and challenging the status quo. While Trump is not without his flaws, his candidacy represents a departure from traditional politics and a call for change that resonates with many Americans.\n\nWhether Trump's presidency would mark a positive or negative shift in American politics remains to be seen. However, his candidacy has undoubtedly shaken up the political landscape and forced the GOP to confront its perceived shortcomings. As the primary race continues, it is clear that Trump's impact on the party and the political landscape will be significant.",
    " Title: House Democrats Initiate Steps to Obtain President Trump's Tax Returns, Holding Hearing on Tax Law and Potential Release\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - House Democrats will take their first step toward obtaining President Donald Trump's personal tax returns, convening a hearing on Thursday to examine legislative proposals and laws dictating the process to acquire the documents. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight will hear testimony from a slate of experts on tax law, including a 1924 measure that allows the chairman of the exclusive tax-writing panel to privately examine anyone's tax returns. A majority vote from the committee would be required to publicly release the returns, if obtained.\n\nDemocratic leaders have argued that the filings could provide a roadmap for investigations into Trump's global businesses and alleviate concerns caused by his refusal to share details about his wealth, debt, charitable giving, and potential conflicts of interest. The call for Trump to make public his tax returns dates back to the early days of the 2016 presidential contest, when he initially signaled he'd gather the volumes of documents that composed his returns and make them available for public inspection. As the campaign progressed, he dialed back that pledge, citing ongoing IRS audits that would complicate any attempt to make them public. Ultimately, the president never released them.\n\n\"There's nothing to learn from them,\" Trump said in an interview with The Associated Press in May 2016.\n\nWhile some progressive Democratic lawmakers have clamored for the release of Trump's tax returns, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Wednesday that it's \"appropriate\" to take a more cautious approach and hold a hearing before acting to obtain the documents.\n\n\"A president of the United States is in a very unique position to individually do things, as this president has displayed probably more than most,\" Hoyer, D-Md., said. \"And, therefore, it's important that the American people know whether the president is acting on their behalf or in his interest.\"\n\n\"We'll see what the hearing comes out with, but I would expect at some point in time we're going to ask for the president's tax returns,\" Hoyer predicted.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the committee who served as chairman during the last Congress and chose not to pursue Trump's returns, said GOP opposition is not necessarily over whether Trump should release his returns but more about \"protecting the rights of every private taxpayer.\"\n\n\"Weaponizing the tax code for political purposes sets a dangerous precedent,\" Brady, R-Texas, told reporters on Wednesday. \"Because if Democrats or any party can abuse their power to rummage through the tax returns of the president, what will stop them from abusing that power in the future frankly to target any individual American that they see as a political enemy?\"\n\nAfter Trump boldly advised Congress not to pursue \"ridiculous partisan investigations\" during his State of the Union address Tuesday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, a senior member of the Ways and Means committee, stressed that the U.S. has a \"checks and balances government.\"\n\n\"This needs to be done methodically,\" Pascrell, D-N.J., said. \"There can not be an ounce of 'let's go get them.' That's never been my intention.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, has vowed to fight requests for the documents while the Treasury Department has signaled it would review the legality of a request, potentially prolonging the process via legal challenges. Five witnesses are expected to testify: Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, an initiative from Tax Analysts; George K. Yin, the Edwin S. Cohen Distinguished Professor of Law and Taxation at the University of Virginia School of Law; Noah Bookbinder, executive director at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington; Steven M. Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center; and Ken Kies, managing director of the Federal Policy Group.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona's Immigration Law's Enforcement Provisions, Strikes Down Penalty Clauses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Monday, the Supreme Court struck down most of Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB 1070, as an unconstitutional infringement on federal power. However, the Court upheld the law's most significant provision, which allows police to question the immigration status of individuals they suspect are in the country illegally.\n\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, announced her intention to move forward with enforcing this part of the law, even as the rest of it is deemed unconstitutional. The ruling, which was 5-3, saw all eight justices agree that Arizona police can question the legal status of those they stop, but the five-justice majority struck down the parts of the law that sought to impose Arizona's own criminal penalties for immigration violations.\n\nThe decision comes less than a week after President Obama announced a policy change that would halt the deportation of most young adult illegal immigrants. This ruling, in conjunction with the policy change, marks a significant shift in the national immigration debate.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy stated that states cannot act in areas where the Constitution grants powers to Congress, specifically citing Article I, Section 8, Clause 4, which grants Congress the power over naturalization. This has long been interpreted to mean that only the federal government can set immigration policy unless it invites states to play a role.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. each wrote dissents, arguing that Arizona should have been allowed to enact its own penalties for immigration violations, in addition to questioning individuals' status.\n\nGovernor Brewer hailed the decision as a \"victory for the rule of law\" and stated that police in her state are prepared to enforce the new authorities fairly. The law requires police to check the immigration status of those they encounter whom they have reasonable suspicion are in the country illegally, and requires them to contact federal immigration authorities to give them a chance to put the individuals in deportation proceedings. The law also imposed state penalties on illegal immigrants who applied for jobs.\n\nThe Obama administration sued to stop the state crackdown laws, but has not taken action against so-called sanctuary city policies. During the debate over SB 1070, both President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. criticized the law as opening up the chance for racial profiling, but did not make this argument in their challenge to the law.\n\nGovernor Brewer issued an executive order asking for training materials to be distributed to all police to refresh them on what constitutes reasonable suspicion for a stop. Race or ethnicity alone is not enough to meet the threshold. The implementation of the law and its potential impact on racial profiling remains a contentious issue.\n\nThe ruling's impact on future state immigration laws is yet to be seen. In 2011, the Court upheld an earlier Arizona law that required all businesses in the state to use E-Verify, the voluntary electronic system the federal government makes available for businesses to ensure their new hires are legal workers. After Arizona, a series of other states passed similar E-Verify laws, but the pace slowed in 2012, according to a study by ImmigrationWorks USA.",
    " Title: The George Zimmerman Verdict and the Persistent Issue of Racism in American Society\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin has sparked a nationwide debate on race, justice, and the application of the law. The verdict, many argue, is a reflection of a broader issue in American society: the subtle, insidious nature of racism that persists despite the abolition of overt, biologically-based discrimination.\n\nThis perspective is echoed in a ThinkProgress piece on \"laissez-faire racism,\" which posits that modern American racism has evolved into a more subtle form of exclusion, blaming African Americans themselves and their cultural norms for their social and economic position. This shift is encapsulated in the quote by Chief Justice John Roberts: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nThe case of Jordan Davis, another shooting in Florida, underscores this point. It's not about the law, although Stand Your Ground may embolden those who might have otherwise retreated, but a culture that views all black youth as potential suspects, drug dealers, gang members, or gun owners, despite their lack of criminal activity. This culture denies young blacks the opportunities needed to succeed, then blames them for their failure, and labels efforts to help them as \"racist.\"\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that African-Americans do not commit crimes at higher rates than whites. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Justice Statistics, rates of robbery, serious property offenses, and violent crime among black youth are at their lowest in 40 years. Yet, young black men are disproportionately victims of murder, a situation often linked to hyper-segregation, entrenched poverty, and lack of economic opportunities in many black communities.\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman is not an isolated incident but the \"correct result of forces we set in motion years ago and have done very little to arrest,\" as noted by The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates. The injustice is not a product of a flawed jury, but a society that has, for the majority of its history, created a pariah class.\n\nAs a society, we must acknowledge and address the inputs that cause racial disparities. This is the purpose of programs aimed at creating opportunities for disadvantaged African-Americans through education, mentoring, and community programs. Blacks care deeply about the violence in their communities, as they live with it daily.\n\nIn conclusion, the George Zimmerman verdict serves as a stark reminder of the persisting issue of racism in American society. It's not about declaring our justice system \"color-blind\" or denying that race plays a role in cases like these, despite the obvious inequality in outcomes. Understanding and addressing the roots of racism is the first step towards achieving a more equitable society.",
    " Title: 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Injunction Against Revised Travel Ban, Sending Case to Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision on Monday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Hawaii District Court's ruling that blocks parts of President Trump's revised travel ban, dealing another blow to the administration as it awaits the Supreme Court's decision on whether to intervene. The California-based court affirmed the lower court's ruling, which temporarily bars nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., suspends the entry of all refugees, and reduces the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nThe three-judge panel on the court ruled that President Trump's revised order does not provide a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality. The judges stated that while the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president broad powers to control the entry of foreigners, the president's authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints.\n\nThe judges cited President Trump's tweets in their finding that the order does not provide a reason why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The judges vacated the part of the lower court ruling that blocked the government's ability to conduct interagency reviews of its vetting procedures, but they ordered the court to issue a new order that blocks the temporary ban but allows the government to proceed with its review.\n\nThe court also called the government's argument that the District Court erred in issuing an injunction that runs against the president himself \"well taken.\" They vacated that part of the District Court's injunction to the extent it runs against the president, but said it still applies to the remaining defendants and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and people in active concert or participation with them.\n\nThe decision marks the second time the 9th Circuit has ruled against President Trump. In February, the court refused to reinstate Trump's first travel ban after a federal District Court judge in Washington state blocked it. President Trump revised the order to address the court's concerns, removing Iraq from the list of banned countries, eliminating the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees, and deleting language that gave preference to religious minorities when the refugee program resumed.\n\nThe administration has already asked the Supreme Court to step in. The Department of Justice filed two emergency applications on June 1 asking the Supreme Court to block the 4th Circuit and Hawaii District Court rulings blocking the ban and to review its case. The Supreme Court had asked the groups fighting the ban to respond to the department's requests by 3 p.m. on Monday. The 9th Circuit is now the second federal appeals court to rule against President Trump's revised travel ban. A full panel of 13 judges on the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to reinstate it, but focused on the statements President Trump made while on the campaign trail and in office in finding the order discriminatory. The judges said in their 10-3 ruling that the revised order \"speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\"",
    " Title: The Democratic Party's Political Crisis: A Legacy of the Obama Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently grappling with a political crisis that could intensify if they fail to secure the White House in the upcoming November elections. This political predicament is a significant part of President Obama's legacy, as his tenure has seen a marked decline in the health of the Democratic Party.\n\nDuring Obama's eight-year presidency, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative, and governorship seats than any other administration in history. When Obama took office, there were 60 Democratic senators; now, there are 46. The number of House seats held by Democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188. There are now nine fewer Democratic governors than in 2009. Democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s.\n\nThe United States electorate is divided into two distinct groups: the Presidential Election America and the Midterm Election America. The former is characterized by a younger, browner, more single, more secular electorate, which is more Democratic. The latter, on the other hand, is older, whiter, more rural, and more church-going, which is more Republican. The majority of governorships and state legislative seats are elected during midterm elections, and these positions serve as the foundation for a party, often referred to as the farm teams for higher-level offices.\n\nCurrently, the Democrats are at a low ebb, a situation President Obama himself has lamented during his campaign for Democrats in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. Democrats, for some reason, only manage to turn out their voters every four years, while Republicans consistently turn out their voters every two years.\n\nThe Democrats also suffered from one significant piece of bad luck: the Republicans' Tea Party-fueled surge in 2010, which coincided with the decennial census, after which new congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn. The Republicans' massive gains in the 2010 midterms gave them control over redistricting in 2011, allowing them to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantaged Democrats.\n\nThis decline in the Democratic Party is not solely due to bad timing and gerrymandering. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee official, notes that Democrats have historically neglected state legislative races, while Republicans prioritize these races. This disparity in focus and resources makes it easier for Republicans to draw districts that disadvantage Democrats, as Democratic voters are often clustered in urban areas, leaving them at a disadvantage in suburban and rural districts.\n\nThis November, the stakes for the Democrats could not be higher. Without the White House, assuming party control elsewhere remains the same, the Democrats would find themselves truly out in the cold.",
    " Title: ICE Council President Criticizes Gang of 8 for Excluding Law Enforcement in Immigration Overhaul Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council President Chris Crane has expressed frustration with the Gang of 8, a bipartisan group of senators working on a new illegal immigration overhaul, for allegedly excluding law enforcement input in the legislative process.\n\nDuring a hearing yesterday, Crane criticized the current lawmaking approach, stating, \"Law enforcement officers within our nation's broken immigration system are purposely excluded from the process and prohibited from providing input.\" He further added, \"Never before have I seen such contempt for law enforcement officers as what I've seen from the Gang of 8.\"\n\nCrane claimed that law enforcement agents, including border sheriffs, interior sheriffs, deputies, and immigration agents, had hoped to share their concerns with the Gang of 8, but were met with indifference. According to Crane, the group failed to attend two meetings held on separate days, and he was escorted out by police when he attempted to ask a question during a Gang of 8 press conference.\n\nCrane has previously criticized the Gang of 8 plan for its perceived inadequacies in addressing the criminal alien and cartel element in the United States. He has also expressed concern that the plan does not allow ICE agents to enforce current immigration laws effectively, both at the border and within the interior of the United States.\n\nDuring a phone call with reporters two weeks ago, Crane emphasized the need to address the criminal illegal alien problem in the United States, stating, \"That part [cartels] is absent from this discussion as are many parts of this...we know that the drug cartels, that the lieutenants and the troops, the soldiers, they're all within the interior of the United States and they're all conducting business as are many other criminal elements and criminal individuals.\"\n\nCrane's comments suggest a growing concern among law enforcement officials that the ongoing immigration debate is more about politics than about addressing the problems within the broken immigration system and ensuring public safety.",
    " Title: GOP Tensions Escalate as Trump's Criticism of Khan Family Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of last week's Democratic National Convention, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has faced mounting criticism from within his own party for his continued attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq.\n\nTwo weeks ago, amidst controversy over plagiarized passages in Melania Trump's convention speech, Donald Trump tweeted, \"All press is good press.\" This seems to be the mindset Trump was embracing Monday morning as he continued to engage in a public feud with the Khans.\n\nSenator John McCain, who was once mocked by Trump for being shot down and captured during the Vietnam War, issued a nearly 700-word statement Monday morning denouncing Trump's critiques of the Khans. McCain stated, \"In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States \u2014 to say nothing of entering its service.\"\n\nMcCain continued, \"I can not emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.\"\n\nOn the final night of the Democratic convention, Khizr Khan spoke out against Trump's call to temporarily ban all Muslim immigrants from the United States, asking whether the candidate had read the Constitution before pulling out a copy from his suit jacket and offering to lend Trump his personal copy.\n\nTrump, in turn, criticized the Khans in TV appearances and on Twitter. Speaking to ABC's This Week, he asked whether Ghazala Khan \"was not allowed to have anything to say.\" (Her response: speaking about her dead son is too painful for her to do in public.)\n\nRepublicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spent the weekend issuing statements distancing themselves from Trump's attacks on the Muslim immigrants. However, on Monday morning, Trump continued to tweet, despite a Sunday night statement issued by Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, that sought to present a more conciliatory picture, saying, \"Donald Trump and I believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family, like all Gold Star families, should be cherished by every American.\"\n\nGold Star families is a term the military uses for the parents, siblings, and children of men and women killed in combat.\n\nIn a Monday morning appearance on the Today Show, Khizr Khan said of Trump's response, \"This candidate amazes me \u2014 his ignorance. He can get up and malign the entire nation. The religions, the communities, the minorities.\"\n\nKhan continued, \"And yet a private citizen in this political process, in his candidacy for the stewardship of this country, I can not say what I feel? That proves the point he has not read the Constitution of the country.\"\n\nDespite being embroiled in a feud with the GOP's presidential nominee, Khan said his last week was a positive experience. \"My belief in the goodness of America is reaffirmed,\" he said. \"Everywhere people are supporting our message. People are hugging, holding hands, wanting to get pictures. That is the goodness of America I was speaking about.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Rule Change to End Flores Settlement, Allow Longer Detention of Immigrant Families\n\nThe Trump administration has announced a proposal to end the Flores settlement, a decades-old legal agreement that limits the detention of immigrant children to 20 days. The new rule, set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, aims to allow families to be detained together throughout their immigration proceedings.\n\nThe proposal, which is almost certain to face legal challenges, is a response to the administration's efforts to crack down on illegal border-crossers and adhere to its zero-tolerance policy. The policy, implemented earlier this year, resulted in the separation of children from their families who were arrested at the border.\n\nThe new rule would offer protections similar to those outlined in the Flores settlement, ensuring that all juveniles in the government's custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors. The proposal states that it aims to address the \"legal loopholes\" that hinder the Department of Homeland Security's ability to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe rule would allow families, most of whom are seeking asylum, to be detained together throughout the duration of their lengthy immigration proceedings. The government has struggled to adhere to the Flores settlement's terms while trying to impose the zero-tolerance policy.\n\nThe administration's practice of separating children from their families had sparked rare, forceful pushback from Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated, \"We should not be separating people at the border.\"\n\nImmigration advocates and others were swift to condemn the proposal. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, stated, \"It is sickening to see the United States government looking for ways to jail more children for longer. That's the complete opposite of what we should be doing.\"\n\nThe administration also reported that ICE deported more than 191,000 immigrants between October and the end of June, a 9% increase from the same time last year. During the Trump administration's first year, 226,199 immigrants were deported, a nearly 6% decrease from the last year of the Obama administration. The agency has also made nearly 120,000 arrests, a 16% increase since last year. About 55% of those arrested were convicted criminals.",
    " Title: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Defends Justice Department's Transparency on Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare interview, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended the Justice Department's handling of the special counsel Robert Mueller's report, stating that Attorney General William Barr is \"being as forthcoming as he can\" in the process of redacting and releasing the report.\n\nDuring the interview, Mr. Rosenstein countered suggestions that Mr. Barr is misleading the public by releasing only a four-page summary of the investigation. The attorney general's letter stated that the Mueller probe found no evidence of President Trump and his campaign conspiring with Russian interference in the 2016 election, but it reached no conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nWith the full report set to be released, likely next week, after redactions for sensitive information, Democrats have demanded access to the document. Mr. Rosenstein dismissed concerns that Mr. Barr is seeking to protect the president from politically damaging information, stating, \"What he said is, 'Look, it's going to take a while to process the report. In the meantime, people really want to know what's in it. I'm going to give you the top-line conclusions.'\"\n\nMr. Rosenstein, Mr. Barr, their top advisers, and a member of Mr. Mueller's team have been reviewing the report for material related to intelligence sources, continuing investigations, grand-jury matters, and the privacy of individuals not charged with crimes. Mr. Rosenstein expressed confidence in Mr. Barr's handling of the report.\n\nThe interview took place in Mr. Rosenstein's office at the Justice Department, as he prepares to leave his position with the special counsel investigation now complete. Mr. Trump's nominee to replace him, Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen, is awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\nOn Thursday, former FBI Director James Comey expressed concern over Attorney General William Barr's characterization of the FBI's court-ordered electronic surveillance as \"spying.\" Mr. Rosenstein declined to comment on Mr. Barr's inquiry into the origins of the 2016 counterintelligence investigation, but he stood by his approval of the renewal of surveillance on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nMr. Rosenstein has been under scrutiny due to his decision to appoint Mr. Mueller early in his tenure, a move that drew criticism from President Trump and some of his advisers. Mr. Rosenstein stated that he has stayed on the job at Mr. Barr's request and expressed pride in his time in office.",
    " Title: President Trump Threatens to Use Military Force, Withhold Aid Over Migrant Caravan Approaching U.S. Border\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to use military force and potentially close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico fails to stop a caravan of more than 4,000 migrants traveling from Honduras towards the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe president's tweets come in response to the ongoing migrant caravan, which has been making its way through Mexico for several days. In the tweets, Trump accused the Democratic Party of encouraging open borders and weak immigration laws, and blamed them for the \"assault on our country\" by migrants from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.\n\nTrump also threatened to withhold aid from these countries if they fail to stop the caravan, and stated that the issue of immigration is more important to him than trade or the USMCA agreement. He further warned that the caravan poses a threat to national security, with \"Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in.\"\n\nThe president's tweets echoed earlier threats made this week, in which he threatened to withhold aid from Honduras if the country failed to stop the caravan. The U.S. has historically provided significant aid to Central American countries, including Honduras, to help address the root causes of migration, such as poverty and violence.\n\nThe migrant caravan is currently making its way through Mexico and is expected to reach the U.S. border in the coming days. It remains to be seen whether Mexico will take action to stop the caravan, or whether the U.S. will follow through on the president's threats to use military force or withhold aid. The situation is developing and will likely continue to be a topic of debate and discussion in the coming days.",
    " Title: New York Times' Decision to Publish Sen. Cotton's Op-Ed Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, The New York Times published an op-ed penned by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) on June 4, 2020, urging President Trump to send in the military to quell the violent riots that have erupted in the wake of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. The op-ed, which has been met with backlash, stands out as a contrasting viewpoint on The New York Times' homepage, known for its liberal leanings.\n\nSen. Cotton, in his piece, advocated for a more aggressive response to the ongoing unrest. This stance, however, has been met with criticism, particularly from those who disagree with his approach. In response to the backlash, Sen. Cotton took to Twitter, commending The New York Times for standing up to the \"woke progressive mob\" in their newsroom.\n\nThe New York Times' editorial page editor, James Bennet, addressed the publication of the op-ed in a series of tweets. He explained that the Times editorial board, which has forcefully defended the protests and criticized the use of force, felt it necessary to publish Sen. Cotton's opinion to provide a counter-argument and foster public scrutiny and debate.\n\nThe response to Bennet's explanation was mixed. Some praised the decision as a testament to the importance of ideological diversity, while others criticized the publication for giving a platform to a senator advocating for potentially harmful policies.\n\nIn the aftermath of the op-ed's publication, it remains to be seen whether other conservative voices will be given similar opportunities to express their views in The New York Times. However, the controversy surrounding the op-ed has sparked a broader conversation about the role of the media in fostering open and honest debate, particularly in times of political and social unrest.",
    " Title: President Obama Launches Economic Agenda Tour, Focuses on Job Security, Education, and Health Care\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to revitalize the American economy, President Barack Obama will embark on a multi-week tour across the country starting Wednesday, aiming to persuade resistant Republicans to collaborate on economic issues. The tour will see Obama outline his vision for the role of Washington and the private sector in stimulating an economy that is experiencing inconsistent growth.\n\nIn his campaign, Obama will address the nation directly, discussing the economy's current state and his proposals for job security, education, and healthcare. Dan Pfeiffer, White House senior adviser, stated in an email that Obama believes that Washington has neglected the economy, the most critical issue facing the country.\n\nThe tour will commence with a significant address at Knox College in western Illinois on Wednesday. Pfeiffer explained that Obama's economic vision was first \"sown\" in this very college during his 2005 commencement speech.\n\nObama's choice of Galesburg, a small town with a long-standing connection to the President, signifies his continued interest in the community. In 2003, former representative Lane Evans introduced Obama, then a state senator, to the community during his underdog campaign for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThroughout his political career, Obama has highlighted Galesburg's struggles, most notably in his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, following the loss of 1,600 jobs at the Maytag plant to Mexico. He delivered the commencement address at Knox College in 2005, his first major economic address.\n\nIn addition to his return to Galesburg, Obama will also visit rural Warrensburg, Missouri, on Wednesday and Jacksonville on Thursday to deliver remarks. The extent to which immigration reform will feature in his speeches remains uncertain, as the Senate has passed immigration legislation, but the GOP-controlled House has shown reluctance.\n\nAs hopes for immigration legislation wane, Obama may be cautiously delving deeper into the immigration debate, as he has previously resisted engaging too deeply in the Capitol Hill debate, in the hope of creating a \"permission structure\" for conservative lawmakers to support the law without appearing supportive of the President.",
    " Title: Online Learning Platforms See Surge in Enrollments Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, many individuals are utilizing their self-isolation time to enhance their skillset through online learning platforms such as edX, FutureLearn, and Coursera. These platforms offer \"massive open online courses\" (Moocs), which have seen a significant increase in enrollments since the onset of the virus.\n\nCoursera, for instance, has experienced an eightfold increase in enrollments for social science, personal development, arts, and humanities courses since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. \"It's unprecedented,\" says the company's chief product officer, Shravan Goli. In late March, its Science of Well Being course saw 500,000 new enrollments in a single weekend.\n\nInvesting some of our quarantine time in self-education makes sense, as it can help bolster careers during this economic uncertainty and provide a sense of control that aids in coping with the anxiety caused by the epidemic. According to James Wallman, author of Time and How to Spend It, personal growth is central to many psychological theories of long-term happiness. Although an hour spent listening to a lecture may not be as appealing as the instant gratification offered by reality TV or social media, it will lead to greater life-satisfaction in the long term.\n\nThe specifics of the courses vary from platform to platform, though many follow a similar model. With larger platforms such as edX, Coursera, and FutureLearn, you can choose university-affiliated courses, ensuring you are learning from experts in the field. The courses range in length, from a few hours to a regular, weekly commitment over several months, and typically involve video lectures, reading texts, and regular tests to assess memory and understanding of the syllabus.\n\nEnrollment is often free, but may require payment to obtain a certificate verifying course completion. While you may be tempted to sign up for courses with the most prestigious instructors, that would be a mistake, says James Murphy, who used Moocs to prepare a master's degree while housebound with an illness. \"Institutional affiliations aren't always a good guide to quality,\" he says.\n\nMany platforms offer user reviews, allowing you to gauge other learners' enjoyment and satisfaction with the course. However, according to Murphy, who is now an associate lecturer at the Open University, nothing beats trying the course for yourself. \"I think the best advice is to sign up and see if you like it \u2013 there's no reason to stick with one you dislike if the delivery isn't engaging. You can usually tell in the first hour if you'll enjoy the course or not,\" he says.\n\nIf you are considering the cost of the certificate and professional development, you might want to check whether employers recognize the qualification. Coursera's Goli points out that about 30 companies now accept the Google-affiliated course on IT management, for example. The reviews can guide you on this, as can the course descriptions, which sometimes include statistics from student surveys about the professional benefits that came from the experience.\n\nIt's also important to pick a course of the right difficulty \u2013 something just beyond your comfort-zone \u2013 engaging enough to occupy your mind, but not so ambitious that it's frustrating. This way, you'll achieve the \"flow state.\" \"You'll lose track of time,\" says Wallman \u2013 and the deep concentration will feel much more rewarding than simply scrolling through social media.\n\nEven if you have chosen a course that is perfectly suited to your goals, you may find your initial enthusiasm evaporates, and your discipline trails off. \"Lack of routine and time is often the biggest hurdle,\" says writer and regular Mooc user Bianca Barratt. Her advice is to try to set up a schedule and \"treat it like a physical class you've signed up for. Show up when you say you will, make an effort with the class exercises and homework, and complete the course in full.\"\n\nAnother good strategy, according to Anant Agarwal, the founder and CEO of edX, is to find a \"study buddy or form a bigger learning group, so that they can motivate each other and enjoy the course together.\" You might make a pact with people you already know, or you could connect with people from the discussion forums that accompany the course. Like your classmates at a traditional school or university, you can help each other to understand the difficult material, and the feeling of accountability might spur you on when you find distractions drawing you away from your goal.\n\nFor some, this may be just the start of the journey \u2013 furnishing them with the confidence to learn and the motivation to take it further. If you find that you're hooked, many of the platforms also provide accredited bachelor's and master's degrees from selected universities, though this will be more expensive.\n\nFor others, the completion of a single course will be enough. But whatever your goals, the quest to learn a new skill or discipline may be the perfect distraction from the frustrations of self-isolation \u2013 allowing you to connect with new people and transforming this period into a time of enlightenment and self-discovery.\n\nHere are seven Moocs to expand your mind:\n\n1. With over 2 million enrollments, this short course offers the mental tools for mastering any new subject.\n2. Physicist Hitoshi Murayama examines the origins of the universe.\n3. Professor James Engell will help you polish your communication skills in this eight-week course.\n4. Physicists, chemists, and restaurant chefs explore the transformation of food in the kitchen.\n5.

    " Title: Baltimore Riots of 1968 and the Echoes of the Past in Today's Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, a scholar of the civil-rights movement expressed concerns about the recent unrest in Baltimore, likening it to the turmoil that swept the city in April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The 1968 riots, which lasted almost four days, resulted in six deaths, 700 injuries, and the destruction of 1,000 businesses.\n\nThe 1968 riots had significant national political implications. The reaction of then-Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew, a moderate Republican, was particularly noteworthy. Agnew summoned 100 black leaders to his office in Baltimore for a heated meeting, during which he accused them of refusing to criticize black militants and of being intimidated by veiled threats.\n\nMany of the black leaders present walked out before Agnew finished his remarks. Others stayed behind to argue with Agnew about his controversial remarks, which were seen as \"speaking truth to enablers\" by some, and an \"insulting sermon\" by others.\n\nA 2008 documentary on the Baltimore riots by radio station WYPR noted that black leaders were conflicted about the looting and burning. They knew it was damaging the black community, but they sympathized with the anger and despair. The riots also had profound political implications, with Agnew becoming Richard Nixon's vice-presidential running mate four months later.\n\nThe riots and Agnew's elevation to the vice presidency also ended the political career of Baltimore Mayor Tommy D'Alessandro, the brother of current House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The WYPR documentary reports that some black leaders believe the Baltimore riots \"helped trigger the law-and-order backlash of the 70's and 80's and a national criminal justice policy that helped put thousands of black men behind bars.\"\n\nIn the current unrest, there are initial concerns about the response of Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and others in dealing effectively with the situation. Her comments about balancing the right to free speech with the need to protect protesters and those causing destruction were misinterpreted and sent a toxic message.\n\nWhether the current riots in Baltimore signal a \"long, hot summer\" of urban unrest this year remains to be seen. However, it is hoped that lessons can be learned from the response to the riots that will be employed in other tense cities.",
    " Title: \"Sequestration Threatens U.S. National Security as Automatic Cuts Loom, but Public Support for Defense Spending Cuts Remains High\"\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta has issued a stern warning that the impending automatic spending cuts, set to impact the Pentagon and various government branches next week, will weaken U.S. national security. In a letter to Congress, Panetta described these cuts as a path towards a \"hollow force.\" However, these warnings seem to have minimal impact on lawmakers and the American public.\n\nPresident Obama highlighted the Navy's decision to keep one of its aircraft carriers docked due to budget constraints. \"As our military leaders have made clear, changes like this \u2013 not well-thought through, not phased in properly \u2013 changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world,\" Obama stated.\n\nHistorically, idling an aircraft carrier to save money would have been unthinkable. The White House initially believed that the prospect of such a move would deter congressional Republicans from allowing the automatic spending cuts to take effect.\n\nWhile some Republicans, such as House Speaker John Boehner, have expressed concern over the military cuts, describing them as \"devastating,\" there appears to be a divide within the GOP when it comes to protecting the Pentagon. According to Congressional expert Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution, there is a \"defense wing of defense hawks\" that is vocal about the impact on the Defense Department and national security. However, there is also a hard-core group that is opposed to any and all revenue increases.\n\nIn an attempt to pressure lawmakers, President Obama is engaging in a series of local TV interviews and planning a visit to a military community outside Washington, D.C. White House spokesman Jay Carney stated, \"The fact of the matter is, congressional Republicans are going to listen to the American people.\"\n\nHowever, the American public may not be as alarmed by the prospect of Pentagon budget cuts. Last year, a survey conducted by the Stimson Center, the Center for Public Integrity, and the Program for Public Consultation asked people how they would address the federal deficit. Nearly two-thirds of respondents opted for defense cuts.\n\nMatt Leatherman of the Stimson Center noted, \"Defense spending was an area that respondents seemed to feel especially comfortable with reductions.\" This suggests that the Pentagon may not be as untouchable as it once was, particularly as more Americans become informed about the intricacies of the defense budget.\n\nThe impending cuts could be a significant test of the public's willingness to accept defense spending reductions if lawmakers fail to reach a deal to avoid across-the-board cuts. Congressional scholar Sarah Binder points out that the automatic cuts were agreed upon in 2011 as a means to postpone the pain of political gridlock. With the gridlock still unresolved, these cuts may indeed be the \"can\" that explodes.",
    " Title: Luxury Beliefs: The New Status Symbols Among the Affluent and Their Impact on Society\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a conversation with a former classmate from Yale, the topic of monogamy and marriage arose, leading to an intriguing discussion about the evolving perceptions of family structures and social norms among the affluent. This conversation sparked an investigation into the concept of luxury beliefs, a modern phenomenon where the upper class adopts ideas and opinions that confer status at minimal cost, often at the expense of the lower class.\n\nThe former classmate, who hails from an affluent family and works at a well-known technology company, expressed a personal preference for monogamous marriage but argued that it should not be a universal expectation. Raised in a traditional family, she plans on having a traditional family, but she views traditional families as outdated and believes society should \"evolve\" beyond them.\n\nLuxury beliefs are not limited to attitudes about marriage and family structures. They also encompass ideas about religion, individual responsibility, and race. For instance, the belief that all family structures are equal is a luxury belief, as evidence shows that families with two married parents are the most beneficial for young children. However, affluent, educated people raised by two married parents are more likely to believe that monogamy is outdated, marriage is a sham, or that all families are the same.\n\nAnother luxury belief is the denigration of religion, which can harm poor communities that often rely on places of worship for social fabric. The luxury belief that individual decisions don't matter much compared to random social forces is more common among the affluent, which can discourage striving among disadvantaged people.\n\nThe luxury belief that took the longest to understand is white privilege. Affluent whites often claim that racial disparities stem from inherent advantages held by whites, yet Asian Americans are more educated, have higher earnings, and live longer than whites. This belief, while popular among the affluent, can have detrimental effects on poor whites when laws are enacted to combat white privilege.\n\nIn conclusion, luxury beliefs are a modern form of status symbol among the affluent, producing real, tangible consequences for disadvantaged people, further widening the social divide. As fashionable clothing will soon be outdated, so will today's fashionable beliefs. In the future, expect the upper class to defame even more values in their quest to gain top-dog status.\n\nRob Henderson (@robkhenderson), a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge and a former Air Force member, offers insightful perspectives on these issues. His work sheds light on the complex interplay between class, beliefs, and social status, providing a nuanced understanding of the role luxury beliefs play in shaping our society.",
    " Title: Tim Pawlenty Endorses Jeb Bush for 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty expressed his belief that former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has the potential to secure the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Pawlenty, who ended his own presidential campaign in 2011, compared Bush to past Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney, citing their personal stories, gritty performances, and campaign resources.\n\n\"Jeb can do that,\" Pawlenty said, acknowledging that Bush's candidacy would not be uncontested if he decides to run. He also noted the evolving nature of the Republican Party, suggesting that it has shifted towards a more Libertarian wing, represented by figures like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nHowever, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll suggests that Bush's last name could pose a challenge for him if he chooses to run. The poll found that 69% of respondents agreed with former first lady Barbara Bush's statement that \"there are more than two or three families who should run for high office in America.\" When asked to specify which families they were referring to, 10% of respondents mentioned Bush, while 7% pointed to the Clinton family. The remaining 50% believed the statement applied equally to both families.\n\nThe poll also showed a decline in Americans' favorable views of Bush compared to a year ago. Currently, 21% view him positively, while 32% have a negative view. In contrast, 11 months ago, 26% had a positive view of him, and 23% had a negative view. The poll, which surveyed 1,000 adults from April 23-27, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nPawlenty's endorsement of Bush comes as several other potential Republican candidates, such as Senator Rand Paul and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, are also considering runs for the 2016 presidential election. The Republican primary race is expected to be highly competitive.",
    " Title: Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford Discusses North Korea Threat and Military Options\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the Aspen Security Forum at the Aspen Institute in Aspen, Colorado, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized the urgency of the North Korean nuclear threat and the need to prepare for the possibility of a military confrontation.\n\nDunford, who chairs the Joint Chiefs of Staff since October 2015, under President Barack Obama, stated that while economic and diplomatic pressure should be applied to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear arms program, a military option should not be ruled out. He described a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula as \"horrific\" and a loss of life unprecedented in modern times, but emphasized that the prospect of a military response to North Korea's nuclear capability is not unimaginable.\n\nDunford's comments followed North Korea's testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile earlier this month. At present, Pyongyang is not believed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon on such missiles, but its rapid advancement in overall weapons systems is a significant concern for the Trump administration.\n\nThe United States is already prepared to defend itself and allies such as South Korea and Japan against North Korea's current capability of carrying out a more limited missile attack, according to Dunford.\n\nDuring the discussion, which was moderated by Andrea Mitchell of NBC News, Dunford expressed his support for the work of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is currently addressing a range of crises, including gathering more international support to pressure North Korea and attempting to mend a diplomatic rift between Qatar and a group of other countries led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe State Department has faced proposed significant financial cuts under a Trump budget plan that is facing resistance in Congress. Dunford underscored the importance of adequately resourcing America's diplomats.\n\nThroughout the hour-long session, there were some lighter moments. When asked about his relationship with President Trump, Dunford joked, \"He loves me! At least I think so.\"",

These documents, which have been partially redacted, suggest that the Justice Department did not initiate the request to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, as previously testified by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nThe emails and memos, made public as part of the lawsuits, reveal that Ross pressured Commerce Department staff to add the question for reasons that a federal judge in Maryland has described as \"mysterious.\" Portions of the documents are blacked out due to redactions by the Trump administration, citing privileges such as attorney-client communications and certain decision-making discussions between government officials.\n\nLawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have been seeking the full release of these emails and memos, as well as other unreleased documents, as part of their investigation into the administration's motives for the citizenship question. This week, President Trump invoked executive privilege over the requested documents, shortly before the committee's Democrats and Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan, voted to hold Ross and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas for the documents.\n\nThe following is a list of the redacted emails that could spark another court battle over the citizenship question:\n\n1. An email sent to Ross by Commerce Department official Earl Comstock on May 2, 2017\n2. An email sent to Ross' then-chief of staff, Wendy Teramoto, by Ross on May 2, 2017\n3. An email sent to Comstock by Ross on Aug. 8, 2017\n4.

Dennis Raico, a former executive at the bank, testified under immunity that Calk had expressed interest in posts such as Treasury secretary or Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nAccording to Raico, Calk took a personal interest in Manafort's loan applications and expedited them. One loan was approved a day after a call on July 27, 2016, during which Calk indicated his desire for a role in the administration. Manafort later asked the incoming administration to consider tapping Calk for the position of Secretary of the Army, as testified earlier in the week. Calk, a retired Army officer and helicopter pilot, did not receive any post in the administration, although he was named to a Trump campaign advisory panel in August 2016.\n\nRaico was one of three witnesses called to the stand on Friday, as the trial resumed after an unexpected recess. The delay disrupted the prosecution's plans to wrap up its case by the end of the week. Greg Andres, a prosecutor on U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, plans to call James Brennan, a vice president at Federal Savings Bank who was also granted immunity, and two other witnesses on Monday before resting their case.\n\nIt remains unclear if Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to 18 felony counts of bank fraud, tax fraud, and failing to disclose about 30 foreign bank accounts, will call any witnesses. So far, Manafort's lawyers have focused their defense on attacking Rick Gates, Manafort's former right-hand man who cut a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller's probe.\n\nRaico testified that Gates had no involvement in the two Federal Savings loans in question - a $9.5 million mortgage on Manafort's estate in the Hamptons and a $6.5 million loan on a brownstone in Brooklyn. Prosecutors claim Manafort lied about his income and provided false information to secure the loans.\n\nRaico testified that Calk asked him to call Manafort shortly after the November 8, 2016, election, to discuss potential roles in the Treasury or HUD posts. Raico stated that the involvement of Calk in the Manafort loans was unusual and made him uncomfortable. He said he had never seen loans approved so quickly at the bank.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Richard Westling sought to justify the loans to Manafort. Westling pointed out that the Hamptons property was appraised at $13 million, well above the $9.5 million borrowed, and that the bank's credit committee had approved the loans.\n\nRaico testified that a letter from Gates indicating that he, not Manafort, would be paying for Yankees season tickets in 2016 lowered Manafort's debts, helping him qualify for the Federal loans. In the letter, Gates stated he had borrowed Manafort's American Express card to pay for the tickets, which cost more than $200,000 a year.\n\nIrfan Kirimca, senior director of ticket operations at the Yankees, testified on Friday that Manafort had purchased four season tickets since at least 2010 and that Gates never had an account with the Yankees. Kirimca testified about one email exchange in which Manafort instructed a Yankees employee to send the tickets to his Trump Tower address.\n\nAndres also questioned Andrew Chojnowski, chief operating officer of home lending at Federal, asking him whether Manafort had signed various documents warning that he could be prosecuted for providing false information to the bank. Chojnowski read one disclaimer which noted that mortgage fraud was punishable by up to 30 years in prison.\n\nAndres plans to call James Brennan, a Federal Savings executive who, like Raico, was granted immunity, on Monday. He also intends to recall Paula Liss, a special agent for the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, who testified earlier this week. Manafort's lawyers have opposed Liss taking the stand again, a matter on which T.S. Ellis, the judge overseeing the case, has yet to rule.\n\nEllis stated that the recess on Friday could not be avoided as he had matters to attend to. Without further details, courtroom observers were left to speculate about the reason for the break and a long bench discussion with attorneys from both sides.\n\nEllis, who reminded jurors in the morning in unusual detail about the need to \"keep an open mind\" about the trial and not to talk to anyone about the case, gave them the same instructions before dismissing them for the weekend. \"Put it completely out of your mind until Monday,\" Ellis said.",
    " Title: Millions of Workers to Receive Overtime Pay Under New Obama Administration Rule\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the Labor Department has finalized a new rule that will make millions of American workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule, which will take effect on December 1, states that anyone who makes less than $47,476 per year must receive time-and-a-half pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours a week. This threshold is roughly double the current threshold of $23,660.\n\nThe rule, one of the most sweeping moves made by the Obama administration so far in its efforts to boost slow-growing incomes, is expected to benefit 4.2 million salaried workers who were previously not eligible for overtime. It could also benefit millions more who are technically eligible but not receiving overtime.\n\nLabor Secretary Tom Perez told NPR that the aim of the rule change is to \"strengthen and grow the middle class.\" He stated, \"In order to do that, we need to ensure that middle-class jobs pay middle-class wages.\"\n\nThe new rule is authorized under the Fair Labor Standards Act, a New Deal-era legislation. In 1975, more than 60 percent of salaried workers were eligible for overtime. However, inflation and regulatory changes under the George W. Bush Administration eroded that protection, and today, only about 7 percent of salaried workers receive time-and-a-half when they work extra hours.\n\nThe rule change has been more than two years in the making. The Labor Department initially proposed an even higher income threshold of more than $50,000 but scaled it back in response to complaints that it did not reflect pay scales in low-wage parts of the country. The new threshold will cover about 35 percent of salaried workers, according to Perez.\n\nWhile some employers have welcomed the change, others have expressed concerns about the speed of the implementation. David French, vice president of the National Retail Federation, stated, \"What our members have told us, what many other employers have told us, is there's not a golden pot of money out there sitting in employers' pockets where they can all of a sudden pay a lot more overtime pay. Instead, they're going to make the rational change, and they're going to change jobs.\"\n\nCritics are urging Congress to block the new rule, but any such push would face a certain veto by President Obama. Secretary Perez says employers have a variety of ways they can comply with the new rule when it takes effect. \"People are going to get at least one of three benefits,\" Perez said. \"They're either going to get more money... more time with their family, or everybody is going to get clarity.\"",
    " Title: Trump Weighs In on Franken Allegations, Remains Silent on Moore Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday night, President Donald Trump commented on the sexual misconduct allegations against Democratic Senator Al Franken, while maintaining his silence on the similar allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.\n\nTrump's tweets, which referenced a photo of Franken allegedly groping a woman while she was asleep and a 1995 New York magazine article about a joke Franken made about drugging and raping journalist Lesley Stahl, marked the first time the President has publicly addressed the allegations against Franken. Franken has apologized for his behavior and has welcomed an ethics probe into his conduct.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has remained largely silent on the Moore controversy, despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against the Republican candidate. When the allegations first surfaced, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement on behalf of the President, stating that if the allegations are true, Moore should drop out of the race. However, Trump has declined to comment further and has ignored questions from reporters regarding Moore's candidacy.\n\nSanders told reporters on Thursday that a Senate investigation into the allegations against Franken was an \"appropriate action,\" but that the decision regarding Moore's candidacy is one for the people of Alabama to make.\n\nThe White House's relative silence on Moore is reportedly due in part to Trump's own history of facing sexual misconduct allegations. A Republican close to the White House told CNN that Trump is apprehensive about being dragged into the topic of sexual assault or harassment if he weighs in.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway offered a different explanation for Trump's silence on Moore, telling Fox News on Friday that the President's silence on the Moore controversy was due to the Franken controversy being \"brand new\" at the time, while the Moore story was \"old news\" by the time Trump returned from Asia. Conway added that Sanders had spoken on behalf of the President regarding Moore, stating that he believes the people of Alabama will sort out what to do with Moore and that the election is their decision.\n\nHowever, Moore's controversy has remained a frequent news story since Trump returned from Asia, and two new Moore accusers came forward as recently as Wednesday.",
    " Title: Senate Kicks Off Bipartisan Debate on Immigration Reform, Awaits Compromise Amidst Uncertain Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States Senate initiated a wide-ranging debate on immigration reform Monday night, with the aim of finding a bipartisan compromise that can secure at least 60 votes, the minimum required for most substantive matters. The legislation under discussion seeks to provide legal protection for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, while also strengthening immigration enforcement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) described the process as an opportunity for diverse perspectives to be expressed, stating, \"It will be an opportunity for a thousand flowers to bloom.\" McConnell has proposed a shell bill, open to amendments and debate over the coming days and weeks. The Senate voted 97-1 to commence the debate Monday night, with only Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz voting against.\n\nIn September, President Trump announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which had previously shielded certain undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, from deportation. The president set a March 5 deadline for Congress to address the issue. Despite several proposals, including some bipartisan efforts, no bill has been brought to a vote in either chamber of Congress.\n\nOn Monday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee unveiled a bill that would offer a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million DREAMers, in exchange for $25 billion for a border wall and at least a 25% reduction in legal immigration. This bill, known as the Secure and Succeed Act, mirrors the White House's proposed solution.\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell endorsed the bill on the Senate floor Monday, calling it a \"balanced proposal\" that offers a \"compassionate resolution\" for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe bill's prospects in the Senate remain uncertain, as many Democrats have expressed concern over the significant reductions in legal immigration, while some conservatives have reservations about the path to citizenship for such a large group.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) stated on the floor Monday, \"Now is not the time, nor the place, to reform the entire legal immigration system. Rather, this is the moment for a narrow bill, and every ounce of our energy is going into finding one that can pass.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) described the legislation as \"a reasonable approach\" that \"is the only Senate proposal that has any chance of passing the House and being signed into law.\"\n\nUnlike the Senate, where the GOP holds a 51-49 majority but needs 60 votes to pass legislation, Republicans in the House have a large enough majority that they do not require a single Democrat's support. Before becoming speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promised some of his party's most conservative members that he would not bring up immigration legislation without the majority's support. Ryan has also stated he would not bring up legislation without the president's support, to avoid risking a veto.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Democratic whip and a key player in the immigration debate, expressed uncertainty about the bill's chances, stating, \"I just don't know at this moment if we'll have 60 votes, I do not know if we can get 11 Republicans to join all the Democrats.\"\n\nThe bipartisan \"gang of six\" previously outlined a more moderate plan that addresses the four areas the White House has indicated it would like to see addressed: legal protections for DREAMers, funding for border security and a wall, changes to family-based or \"chain\" migration, and an end to the diversity visa lottery program. However, the White House has rejected this proposal, and the bipartisan group is still deciding whether to introduce it or a similar amendment.",
    " Title: U.S. President Trump Claims High COVID-19 Case Count Due to Superior Testing Capacity, Health Officials Discuss Testing Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump attributed the United States' high number of coronavirus infections to the country's superior testing capacity. The U.S. has reported over a million confirmed cases, with total deaths exceeding 58,000 by late Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nThe President's comments came as state public health officials have warned of shortages of trained workers and materials that have limited testing capacity. The rise in cases has put pressure on efforts to boost testing capacity and health officials have flagged the challenge of getting tests to those who need them most.\n\n\"The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world,\" Trump tweeted. \"Other countries are way behind us in testing, and therefore show far fewer cases.\"\n\nU.S. infectious diseases expert and health official Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN in an interview on Tuesday that every American in need of a virus test should be able to get one by the end of May or the beginning of June.\n\n\"One of the problems has been is the tests getting to the people who need them,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe virus has taken an unprecedented toll on the U.S. economy, with a likely contraction in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession. The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits over the past five weeks has soared to 26.5 million, or nearly one in six U.S. workers, and the Trump administration has forecast an April unemployment rate exceeding 16%.\n\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)",
    " Title: Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi Shooting Investigated as Terrorism-Related Incident\n\nThe Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi in Texas is currently on lockdown following an active shooter incident that occurred on Thursday, May 21, 2020. The shooter, identified as Adam Alsahli of Corpus Christi, was reportedly neutralized, and the facility remains on lockdown.\n\nAccording to three unnamed officials familiar with the investigation, the shooter attempted to enter the base at approximately 6:15 a.m., opening fire and wounding a sailor who is a member of base security. The sailor was able to roll over and activate a barrier, preventing the gunman from gaining access to the base.\n\nInitial concerns arose regarding the possibility of an explosive device, but Navy experts conducted a sweep of the area and the suspect's vehicle, finding no evidence of such a device. Officials are still processing the crime scene and have recovered some type of electronic media.\n\nFBI Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Leah Greeves confirmed at a news conference that the incident is being investigated as terrorism-related. Investigators are working to determine whether a second person of interest is at large, but no further details have been provided. The motive behind the shooting remains undisclosed, and the FBI is leading the investigation in conjunction with state, local, and federal partners.\n\nThe injured sailor has since been discharged from the hospital, where she received treatment for minor injuries. The air station, which is home to Naval pilot training since 1941, is surrounded by water on three sides and also houses the Corpus Christi Army Depot, a Department of Defense rotary wing aircraft depot.\n\nThe base experienced a similar lockdown in December 2019, and in another incident last year, a man pleaded guilty to destruction of U.S. government property and possession of a stolen firearm for ramming his truck into a barricade at the Corpus Christi station.\n\nThe shooting also follows a similar incident at a Navy base in Pensacola, Florida, in which a Saudi Air Force officer killed three U.S. sailors and wounded eight other people in a shooting that American officials described as an act of terrorism. The gunman in that attack, Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, had reportedly been in touch with al-Qaida operatives about planning and tactics in the months leading up to the shooting.\n\nAttorney General William Barr has been briefed on the ongoing investigation, and no international or foreign national students are currently at the Texas base, according to U.S. officials. The military has implemented new safety procedures in response to the Pensacola shooting to restrict and better screen international students.",
    " Title: White House Expands Obamacare Exemptions, Allows Millions to Opt Out of Individual Mandate\n\nThe White House has announced that millions of Americans whose health plans were cancelled due to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) will be exempt from the individual mandate. This decision comes just before the deadline for signing up for coverage starting January 1.\n\nThe administration also revealed that people who had their plans cancelled could opt for a scaled-back catastrophic health plan, which offers more limited benefits compared to other Obamacare health plans. This move has prompted criticism from Republicans and concerns from the insurance industry, who fear it could lead to marketplace instability and consumer confusion.\n\nKaren Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, stated, \"This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers.\"\n\nRepublicans, who have long opposed the individual mandate as a contentious aspect of the health law, view this change as another sign of a flawed policy. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) commented, \"The administration is recognizing the grim reality that more Americans have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare... This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama had previously stated that people could keep their health plans under his health law, a promise that faced criticism following the cancellation of millions of plans, particularly in light of the HealthCare.gov debacle that made it difficult for people to shop for replacement coverage. Obama conceded last month that he was wrong to make that pledge.\n\nThe administration estimates that fewer than half a million people whose plans were cancelled have not yet found new coverage. However, the new rules will allow people to get a \"hardship exemption\" if their new options are too expensive. Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, explained, \"This is a common sense clarification of the law... For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been canceled and are seeking coverage, this is one more option.\"\n\nThe catastrophic plan, which has always been a part of the Affordable Care Act, is an option for people under 30 and for those who qualify for specific exemptions, such as affordability. Under the new policy, people would need to provide proof of a cancelled policy to qualify for the exemption.\n\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a letter to six Senate Democrats who requested a policy change, \"As a result, in addition to their existing options these individuals will also be able to buy a catastrophic plan to smooth their transition to coverage through the Marketplace.\"\n\nThe administration does not expect many people will take up the new option, but wants to ensure that catastrophic coverage is available to those who had plans cancelled. However, making catastrophic health plans more broadly available also poses problems for insurers, as it could disrupt the insurance pools and further depress enrollment, which is already below target due to website problems.",
    " Title: US Citizenship Data for 2013 Reveals Immigration Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security has released data on the 779,929 immigrants who became U.S. citizens in 2013. The data shows a global influx of individuals, with a few countries dominating the list of origin.\n\nA chart of naturalized citizens based on country of origin reveals a steep curve. Twice as many people born in Mexico became citizens in 2013 as people born in India, the next largest group. India, in turn, saw twice as many citizenship applications approved from its citizens than nearly any other country, with the exceptions being the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, China, and Cuba.\n\nThe data also shows a wide range of countries represented, with people who became citizens last year hailing from 198 countries in total. Notably, 2,807 new citizens are listed as having been born in the \"former Soviet Union,\" which could indicate a significant presence of individuals who have lived in the United States since before the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe map accompanying the data is not a mistake, as it shows 55 new citizens born in the United States. While most people born in the U.S. are automatically citizens at birth, there are exceptions, with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services explaining that these 55 new citizens could be the children of diplomats from other countries.\n\nNew citizens are also clustered in a handful of states, notably California, New York, and Florida. However, every state has at least some new citizens in it. Wyoming, which has the fewest new citizens, is still home to 242 of them, almost as many as were born in the whole country of Austria (248).\n\nA second map, labeled based on the country of origin that produced the number of new US citizens closest to the number of new citizens present in each state, offers a different perspective. Wyoming, for example, is labeled Austria, while Kentucky is labeled Turkey. A few countries are used twice, but attempts were made to avoid duplicates.\n\nCalifornia stands out as an exception to the map, with 164,792 new citizens living there. No single country even had close to that many people naturalized as U.S. citizens last year, even in a country that's still a nation of immigrants.",
    " Title: CNN's Report on RAISE Act Job Losses: A Closer Look at the Economic Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report, CNN joined several other national media outlets in expressing concerns about the potential economic effects of the RAISE Act, a bill proposed by the Trump administration that aims to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade. The report, titled \"Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs, Ivy League study finds,\" relies on an analysis of the bill by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n\nThe Wharton study projects that by 2040, the American economy would lose over 4 million jobs and be 2% smaller under the RAISE Act than it would be under current immigration levels. However, the report's interpretation of these findings may be misleading.\n\nSteve Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), argues that CNN's report overlooks a crucial factor: the RAISE Act would result in a smaller population due to the decrease in immigration, which would naturally lead to fewer workers. In other words, a smaller population would have fewer workers, but this does not necessarily indicate harm to the native population.\n\nCamarota further contends that the report's focus on overall GDP and job losses is misleading. He suggests that the media's emphasis on GDP does not accurately reflect the standard of living, as adding people to a country does not inherently raise the standard of living. For instance, Bangladesh, with a larger population and GDP, is not considered richer than New Zealand. What truly matters, according to Camarota, is per capita GDP, which the Wharton analysis also addresses, finding a negligible effect from reduced immigration under the RAISE Act.\n\nFurthermore, the study's authors suggest that the domestic worker participation rate wouldn't increase enough under the RAISE Act to fill the jobs that immigrants would have filled. This implies that the job market would become more favorable for native-born Americans, as noted by CIS fellow Jason Richwine in a blog post.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Wharton study provides insights into the potential economic effects of the RAISE Act, it is essential to consider the perspectives of experts like Camarota and Richwine, who argue that the report's interpretation may be misleading and that the RAISE Act could potentially lead to a more favorable job market for native-born Americans.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Hopefuls Converge in Iowa for Iowa Freedom Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nA number of potential Republican presidential candidates will gather in Des Moines this weekend for the Iowa Freedom Summit, an event widely regarded as the first major gathering of the 2016 GOP presidential race. The daylong event, co-hosted by the group Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, is set to feature nearly a dozen potential candidates, with Iowa, the first state to vote in the presidential nominating season, being a crucial stop for White House hopefuls.\n\nAmong the speakers at the summit are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Notably absent are Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, who cited scheduling conflicts, as well as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who are both attending a separate event in California this weekend.\n\nChristie, who is considered a moderate and pragmatic candidate, is one of the most anticipated speakers at the summit. He has angered social conservatives in the past due to his stance on same-sex marriage and contraceptive coverage, but has focused on drug rehabilitation programs in his state. The governor has made five trips to Iowa in the past year, including stops to help raise money for King and Gov. Terry Branstad.\n\nThe summit will provide Christie an opportunity to stand out and earn points among Iowans, as Romney and Bush are soaking up much of the attention and resources among establishment Republicans. Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist from Iowa, said, \"In terms of optics, I think it's clear that Gov. Christie intends to run\u2014and has every intention to speak to as many Iowans as possible. That's how you build a winning coalition\u2014and he seems to get that.\"\n\nOther issues that could get frequent mention this weekend include immigration reform, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The Supreme Court's decision to take up same-sex marriage this year will likely be a hot topic, as the court will essentially decide whether states have the right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married. The House recently passed a measure banning all taxpayer money for abortions, while the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision was marked this week with tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists marching in the nation's capital.\n\nSantorum, who battled Romney late into the 2012 primary season, tweeted out photos of his family yesterday explaining why they were marching. The former senator from Pennsylvania barely won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, edging out Romney in a delayed vote count by 34 votes.\n\nLike Christie, some Republicans have also taken on criminal justice reform and anti-poverty policies as key talking points in their platforms. We'll see how potential candidates tackle those issues this weekend, especially as the party on the national level has made efforts to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nSeveral of the potential candidates plan to stay longer in Iowa. Huckabee has book signings on Sunday in Cedar Rapids and Windsor Heights, Iowa, while Perry is staying until Monday and Santorum until Tuesday for multiple events throughout the state.",

Bradley Moss, an attorney who specializes in national security and transparency issues, said \"facts and legal reality have no relation\" to the threatened lawsuit.\n\nSyria: Trump says Kurds are'very happy' with U.S.-brokered deal and U.S. has 'taken control' of oil\n\nThe complaint is the latest salvo in the long-running war between Trump and the news media, particularly CNN. Trump frequently sued rivals during his business career. This latest threat cites reports from a conservative group that obtained tapes of CNN employees discussing coverage of the president.\n\nThe threatened lawsuit is not a libel suit, as Trump's attorneys cite alleged violations of the Lanham Act, which is designed to prohibit trademark infringement and \"false advertising.\"\n\nLegal analysts pointed out that this would not be a libel suit. Moss said, \"Trump suing CNN is not about winning in court, it's about appealing to his base with a PR stunt.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has been involved in a legal dispute with the media. In August of 2018, after an attack from Trump, CNN issued a statement saying, \"Make no mistake, Mr. President, CNN does not lie. We report the news. And we report when people in power tell lies.

    " Title: Family of Suspect in Finsbury Park Attack Expresses Shock and Sorrow\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the terror attack near a London mosque, the family of the arrested suspect, Darren Osborne, has issued a statement expressing their shock and sorrow. The 47-year-old man was detained on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences following the incident in Finsbury Park where a van hit a group of Muslims who were helping a man who had collapsed.\n\nThe statement, released by Osborne's mother, sister, and nephew, reads: \"We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in.\" They also expressed their condolences to those who were injured in the attack.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police, led by Commissioner Cressida Dick, has confirmed that the incident was \"quite clearly an attack on Muslims,\" and the community will see increased police presence, particularly around religious establishments. The suspect is believed to have acted alone, according to Security Minister Ben Wallace.\n\nThe attack occurred shortly after midnight near the Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road, which is also a community center. Eleven people were injured, including nine taken to hospital and two treated at the scene. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt.\n\nFaith leaders addressed a vigil outside the nearby Finsbury Park Mosque on Monday night. Mohammed Kozbar, chairman of the mosque, told the gathering that the attack was \"on our families, on our freedom, on our dignity.\" The Bishop of Stepney, Rt Rev Adrian Newman, said \"an attack on one faith is an attack on us all.\"\n\nThis is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, following incidents in Westminster, Manchester, and on London Bridge. Prime Minister Theresa May described the attack as \"every bit as sickening\" as the others.\n\nThe driver of the van was detained by bystanders before police arrived. The imam of Muslim Welfare House said a passing police van was flagged down. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters, \"We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you do not take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt.\"\n\nThe unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are a stark contrast to the beliefs of extremists of both far-right and violent jihadist ideologies. The attack risks being used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks, as online followers of the so-called Islamic State have already seized on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of widespread hostility towards Muslims in the West.",

The two leaders chatted throughout their walk to the House of Peace and were all smiles and handshakes inside as they began their discussions.\n\nKim Jong-un expressed his surprise at not having met Moon before, stating that he had wondered to himself why it had taken so long. Kim also extended an invitation to visit Seoul at any time if invited. In a significant development, Kim reportedly promised Moon that there would be no more nuclear missile tests, stating that he did not want to disturb Moon's early morning sleep due to national security council meetings caused by their actions.\n\nKim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, was by his side throughout the formalities at the House of Peace. She handed him a pen to sign a guestbook, took the schoolchildren's flowers from his hand, and sat next to him scribbling notes at the start of the talks with Moon.\n\nAlthough this is the first time the public has heard Kim Jong-un in conversation, Kyung Bok-cho, a Bloomberg journalist, noted that Kim's speaking voice did not have much of an accent and \"wouldn't sound out of place in the middle of Seoul.\" Kim's demeanor as he walked towards Moon at the border also spoke volumes.\n\nWhile the mood of the summit was optimistic, there is still a great deal of skepticism about what it all means for peace on the peninsula. Robert Kelly of Pusan National University in South Korea warned that Pyongyang \"hasn't really changed, and it hasn't offered a meaningful concession yet.\" He added that there are still \"huge\" strategic and political divisions between the North and the South, as well as the US.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that there have been false dawns before on the Korean peninsula, while US President Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about the proposed meeting with Kim, stating that he did not know if it would even take place. As such, the situation remains tense on the peninsula.",
    " Title: Controversy Surrounds $53,000 Curtain Installation in U.S. Ambassador to the UN's Residence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, Nikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, is facing criticism over the purchase of customized curtains for her official residence, which cost nearly $53,000. The purchase, made in 2016 during the Obama administration, is being scrutinized amid deep budget cuts within the State Department.\n\nThe New York Times reported this week that $52,701 was spent last year on customized and mechanized curtains for the picture windows in Haley's New York City residence, for which rent is $58,000 a month. However, the paper did not mention until the sixth paragraph that Haley's spokesman stated the Trump administration had no input in the purchase decision.\n\nBrett Bruen, a White House official in the Obama administration, questioned the expenditure, stating, \"How can you, on the one hand, tell diplomats that basic needs can not be met and, on the other hand, spend more than $50,000 on a customized curtain system for the ambassador to the U.N.?\"\n\nAndrew Stroehlein, Human Rights Watch's European Media Director, expressed his disapproval in a tweet, stating, \"When @nikkihaley's not busy rejecting the idea of universal human rights, she's busy spending $52,701 of US taxpayer money on curtains for her residence. Milk the people, screw the world. Fine priorities you got there, [sic].\"\n\nThe curtains themselves reportedly cost almost $30,000, but the hardware needed to operate them cost an additional $22,801. The curtains were installed last year.\n\nPatrick Kennedy, the top management official at the State Department during the Obama administration, defended the spending, stating the curtains will be used by future officials and citing security and entertainment purposes. Kennedy explained, \"All she's got is a part-time maid, and the ability to open and close the curtains quickly is important.\"\n\nThe State Department, under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, had frozen hiring, reduced diplomatic staff, and proposed cutting the department's budget by 31 percent.",
    " Title: Roberts' Narrow Victory Over Wolf: A Closer Look at the Kansas Senate Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Senate primary in Kansas, incumbent Pat Roberts managed a narrower-than-expected win over challenger Milton Wolf on Tuesday, effectively thwarting conservative efforts to topple an incumbent GOP senator in 2014. This marks the first cycle since 2008 when no incumbent Republican senator lost renomination.\n\nRoberts secured 48 percent of the vote, while Wolf garnered 41 percent. The remaining 11 percent of the vote was split between two minor candidates. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), chaired by Roberts' Kansas colleague, Sen. Jerry Moran, played a significant role in Roberts' victory.\n\nThe NRSC sent six workers to the Kansas City area for the final 10 days, and they knocked on more than 10,000 doors in Johnson County alone. A Washington phone bank set up by the NRSC also made more than 40,000 phone calls in the final three weeks. This strategic focus on turning out supporters in Wolf's home base proved crucial, as Wolf needed a strong margin in Johnson County to offset Roberts' strength in the 1st Congressional District on the western side of the state, which Roberts represented in the House for 16 years.\n\nIn Johnson County, Roberts and Wolf fought to a virtual tie, with Wolf taking 45.7 percent to Roberts' 45.4 percent, a 147-vote difference. Roberts' campaign reached more than 200,000 GOP households in the state through live telephone calls and door knocks over the final three weeks.\n\nThe NRSC also sent its regional political director, Brittany Belt, into Kansas for the final three weeks before the primary. She focused on the early vote and worked with the campaign on messaging in the final weeks.\n\nSen. Roberts, who has served as a diligent check on Democrats' push for ever-expansive government and is a true conservative voice for the state, according to Sen. Jerry Moran, alluded to the bruising campaign in his victory speech and urged Republicans to refrain from similar infighting in future elections.\n\nWolf, a radiologist who attacked Roberts from the right, portrayed Roberts, 78, as a creature of Washington, frequently questioning whether he truly resided in the state or merely parachuted in to fight for reelection. Wolf, a second cousin once removed of President Barack Obama, presented himself as a hard-line conservative and built his bid around an effort to undo Obamacare.\n\nThis primary race, while focused on the Republican primary, highlights the ongoing tension between the Republican establishment and the tea party movement, with the former providing significant support to incumbents and the latter pushing for more conservative candidates. The stakes are high, as both parties gear up for the general election in November.",
    " Title: Journalists and News Organizations Challenge New Restrictions on Coverage of Senate Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and concern among news organizations and journalists, new ground rules for reporters covering the Senate impeachment trial have been imposed by the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, Michael Stenger. These restrictions, negotiated in part with Republican leadership, have been met with pushback from reporters and advocates who argue that they limit access to newsmakers and infringe upon the public's right to know.\n\nTypically, correspondents who undergo an official credentialing process are granted broad access throughout the Capitol complex, with few restrictions when it comes to talking with members of Congress or others. However, under the new rules for the impeachment trial, reporters are being confined to small cordoned-off sections in areas where unrestricted access was previously standard. They are also being prevented from walking with senators to continue conversations, even when the senator is willingly participating.\n\nFurthermore, reporters are now prohibited from approaching senators for interviews in the halls surrounding the Senate chamber. Taken together, these new rules effectively prevent members of the press from reaching many senators.\n\nThe Capitol is one of the few places in official Washington where journalists get direct access to newsmakers. Elsewhere, such as in the White House or the State Department, reporters' movements are more closely controlled, and access to principals can be severely limited. The Senate's new security measures are unusually strict, even more so than the security protocols typically put in place for the annual State of the Union address, which is attended by the president, many members of the Cabinet, and the Supreme Court. The president is not expected to attend the trial.\n\nSenate Sergeant-at-Arms Stenger and the Capitol Police may fear that the additional attention drawn to the Senate impeachment trial may increase risks to members of Congress. However, members of the press corps are vetted through a longstanding system and pass through security checks every time they enter the Capitol complex.\n\nIn response to these new restrictions, nearly 60 news organizations, including NPR, signed a letter organized by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press on Thursday. The letter, addressed to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), urges the relaxation of the new restrictions on reporters.\n\n\"Absent an articulable security rationale, Senate leaders, the Senate sergeant at arms, and the United States Capitol Police have an obligation to preserve and promote the public's right to know,\" the letter states. \"Reporters must have the ability to respond quickly to rapid developments and need reasonable access to lawmakers who wish to speak to the press.\"\n\nPatricia Gallagher Newberry, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, criticized the new Senate restrictions because they deny reporters the ability to fully cover a once-in-a-generation spectacle. \"To deny journalists their constitutional right to document the historical events occurring now is a gross injustice to the American people,\" she said.\n\n\"The press is charged with holding the government accountable. It is through its access that the public is informed. When the public is informed, it can make better decisions. The American public should also be outraged about these restrictions,\" Gallagher Newberry added.\n\nAngela Greiling Keane, president of the National Press Club Journalism Institute, warned that the prospect of these continued restrictions could chill reporters' ability to cover big events or even normal business in the Capitol in the future. \"These restrictions set a horrible precedent and reinforce the lie that the news media is dangerous and the 'enemy of the people,'\" Keane said. \"Congress should be the most accessible institution in government. As the branch closest to the people, it is ironic that these limits only isolate those who are elected to serve.\"\n\nNews organizations that assign correspondents to the Capitol, including NPR, are continuing to negotiate ground rules with Stenger and the Capitol Police.",
    " Title: House Leaders Vow to Pass $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill Despite Last-Minute Hurdles\n\nThe House of Representatives has vowed to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday, despite a last-minute obstacle posed by a conservative member that has prompted lawmakers to return to Washington.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expressed confidence in the bill's passage as she entered the Capitol on Friday morning, stating, \"We're going to pass it today.\"\n\nInitially, House leaders aimed to pass the massive stimulus package, which was approved by the Senate on Wednesday night, without convening the full chamber due to concerns about travel and crowding. They intended to do so through a voice vote, allowing some members to debate the legislation and voice their concerns without the need for the entire House to reconvene.\n\nHowever, a conservative lawmaker, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has threatened to force a roll-call vote on Friday, necessitating party leaders to devise a contingency plan for moving the package to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) has been in discussions with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to find a swift solution. \"I've talked to McCarthy last night, and we're working together to get this done,\" Hoyer said.\n\nIf Massie forces a roll-call vote, party leaders expect to have enough lawmakers on the floor on Friday to form a quorum, the minimum number of members required to stage a recorded vote. In this case, the House can approve the measure on Friday, despite Massie's maneuver.\n\nThe House convened at 9 a.m. to begin the debate, which was initially expected to last for two hours. However, Pelosi stated that the debate has been extended to three hours. \"We will respect the congressional traditions, and we will have a little longer debate than we had anticipated. My understanding is it will be extended to three hours, and then we'll have the votes,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked whether the vote would be by voice or recorded, Pelosi left the decision open. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), speaking earlier on CNBC, remained uncertain about the Friday vote, reflecting the ongoing efforts by leaders to finalize the plan.\n\n\"So we get this done one way or the other today or tomorrow,\" said Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. \"I think there's a better than even chance we get this done today. We do have some names mentioned of people who might call for a roll-call vote. I hope that doesn't happen. But in case it does, members are coming back for this vote.\"",
    " Title: Trump Shifts Stance on Border Wall Funding, Clearing Path for Government Spending Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to delay funding for the proposed border wall with Mexico until later this year, potentially paving the way for a government spending bill to avoid a shutdown this weekend. This move could remove one of the last remaining obstacles in the ongoing negotiations between congressional Democrats and Republicans over the five-month spending bill.\n\nThe president's new flexibility on the border wall funding, discussed at a White House reception with conservative media on Monday, could ease the tension surrounding the contentious issue. The president's decision to consider funding the wall in a later bill rather than the current one removes a significant hurdle in the bipartisan and bicameral negotiations.\n\nThe debate over the border wall, which was initially expected to be included in the spending bill, is now likely to be put on hold to prevent a government shutdown. The House Republican debate over a healthcare bill is expected to be pushed aside for the time being.\n\nWithout the border wall as a point of contention, lawmakers may be able to reach an agreement on the spending bill more quickly. Both Democrats and Republicans had signaled their willingness to increase funding for the military and broader border security, but there was little appetite among Republicans on Capitol Hill for specifically funding the border wall. Democrats had stated they would oppose a spending bill that included money for the border wall.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) welcomed the president's decision, stating, \"It's good for the country that President Trump is taking the wall off the table in these negotiations.\" Earlier in the day, Schumer had called the wall a \"nonstarter\" for Democrats.\n\nThe Senate, where spending bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles, will require Democratic votes due to the Republicans' 52-seat majority. House GOP leaders will also likely need some Democratic support, as some conservative Republicans are expected to oppose the bill.\n\nMany Republicans have expressed satisfaction with a spending bill that includes funding for border security, but not necessarily for a wall. \"Border security's the main issue\u2014whether that includes a wall or technology, drones, or repairing what we have,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). Capito added that she was not interested in risking a shutdown over the border wall.\n\nIn March, the administration requested $1.4 billion in spending for the current fiscal year for the wall, with an additional $2.6 billion for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1. The fiscal 2017 money was intended to fund 48 miles of new border and levee wall systems, 14 miles of replacement fencing, as well as some technology improvements and road construction.\n\nOne remaining issue that needs resolution is whether the five-month spending bill under negotiation will include payments to health insurers known as \"cost-sharing reductions.\" These payments support Affordable Care Act insurance plans by helping insurers lower costs for low-income consumers. An abrupt withdrawal of these payments could pose an immediate threat to health-insurance markets, potentially leading to the collapse of health plans midyear.",
    " Title: Syrian Refugees Turn Entrepreneurs in Britain: A Tale of Resilience and Innovation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of London, two Syrian refugees, M OHAMMED RAHIMEH and Majeda Khoury, are making a name for themselves in the food industry. Both individuals, who left their homeland under difficult circumstances, are now using their skills and experiences to carve out a niche in the British market.\n\nM OHAMMED RAHIMEH, who fled Damascus in 2015 to avoid conscription, has established a food business, Mo's Eggs, offering a unique Syrian brunch experience. Despite arriving in Britain with no cooking qualifications or English skills, he honed his culinary skills during his asylum claim processing period. With the help of Alexandra Simmons, a volunteer he met in Calais, he set up his business, taking advantage of the trend for pop-up restaurants.\n\nHis first venture was a pop-up at a pizza restaurant in Archway, north London, serving around 60 people every month. He is now preparing to open a new location in Tooting Broadway, in the south of the city. In the interim, he has been working at a market stall to learn more about the food trade.\n\nSimilarly, Majeda Khoury, a human-rights activist, learned to cook through a charity called Migrateful and now prepares food associated with different Syrian cities. Her signature dish, harak osbao, features lentils and pasta with tamarind, coriander, garlic, and pomegranate molasses. She runs catering at big events for charities that focus on Syria.\n\nBoth Ms. Khoury and Mr. Rahimeh have benefited from sales and marketing training by the Enterpreneurial Refugee Network (TERN), a charity aiming to launch 1,000 refugee-led businesses in Britain by 2025.\n\nRefugees face significant challenges in starting businesses, especially when they are confined to camps. Paul Hutchings, a former market researcher turned humanitarian worker, is trying to help those stuck in such situations. He set up Refugee Support in 2016, a charity involved in camps in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Greece, and Mexico.\n\nRefugee Support promotes dignity rather than dependence, providing opportunities for refugees to learn skills and earn a living. The charity has set up a shop, a sewing co-operative, and a bicycle-sharing scheme in Cyprus to help refugees find work.\n\nThe refugees interviewed for this article have demonstrated an incredible work ethic, a testament to their resilience and determination. Their stories serve as a reminder of the valuable contributions immigrants can make when given the opportunity to work and rebuild their lives.",
    " Title: House GOP Proposes Deficit Reduction Plan, Faces Criticism from Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avert the impending fiscal cliff, House Republicans unveiled a deficit reduction plan on Monday, which includes revenue increases and spending cuts. The proposal, however, has been met with skepticism and dismissal from the Obama administration, who deem it insufficient in demanding more from the nation's wealthiest taxpayers.\n\nThe Republican plan aims to generate $2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, with $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings, and $600 billion in other spending cuts. The plan also promises $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner described the plan as a \"credible one that deserves serious consideration by the White House.\" The move comes amidst a heated battle between both parties to find a solution to the looming fiscal cliff, a scenario many economists warn could harm the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Obama administration, on the other hand, has criticized the Republican plan for not demanding enough from the wealthiest taxpayers. White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer stated, \"Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won't be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit.\"\n\nThe Republican proposal contrasts with President Obama's deficit-reduction plan, which aims to increase tax revenue by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a $4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. Obama's plan includes closing loopholes, limiting deductions, raising the estate tax rate to 2009 levels, and increasing tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n\nRepublicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have emphasized the need for major reforms of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The GOP plan offers $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes.\n\nThe GOP's proposal has been met with criticism for its lack of specifics, with White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer stating, \"The Republican proposal includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.\"\n\nAs both sides continue to negotiate, the stakes are high. Failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package could cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Acknowledges Ancestral Slave Ownership, Emphasizes Reparations and Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Medium post published on Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke and his wife, Amy, revealed that their paternal great-great-great grandfathers listed two women as their possessions, indicating a family history of slave ownership. O'Rourke wrote that the enslaved Americans owned by his ancestors were denied their freedom, civil rights, and the ability to amass wealth, and that he benefits from a system built by his ancestors that favored them at the expense of others.\n\nO'Rourke stated that it is essential for individuals to know their own story in relation to the national story, and that this knowledge is necessary to take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop perpetuating injustice. The former Texas congressman outlined several policy promises, including addressing underfunding for minority-majority public schools, giving federal capital to minority- and women-owned businesses, universal health care, and criminal justice reform, in the context of addressing the legacy of slavery.\n\nO'Rourke also emphasized his support for reparations for the descendants of slaves, beginning with a national conversation on slavery and racial injustice. The debate over reparations reentered mainstream political discourse after the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the issue in June. A bill sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) to form a commission to study whether black Americans should receive reparations for slavery has been gaining steam in the House, with many 2020 hopefuls endorsing the move.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has roundly opposed the initiative. Following his opposition to reparations, a report from NBC News found that McConnell's ancestors owned a total of more than a dozen slaves. In response, McConnell said it put him in the same camp as former President Obama, who also opposed reparations and is a descendant of slaveholders.",
    " Title: White House Visitor Logs: A Return to Previous Policy and a Five-Year Wait for Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move reminiscent of previous administrations, the White House has reverted to a policy of withholding visitor logs, a decision that has sparked legal action from transparency groups. Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, has labeled the national security argument as \"a falsehood,\" stating that the Obama-era policy already made exceptions for such information.\n\nThis week, the National Security Archive, along with two other organizations, sued the government for visitor logs from the White House, Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and Trump Tower. Mr. Blanton expressed his anticipation of the legal action, stating, \"Their action today shows they were just looking for a way to hide the logs.\"\n\nDuring the Bush administration, government transparency groups faced similar challenges in obtaining specific visitor information to the White House, only to be met with resistance from the president's lawyers. The issue persisted until the Obama administration, which emphasized its commitment to transparency, adopted a policy of releasing visitor logs with certain exceptions, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAlthough a federal court ruled in 2011 that visitor logs could be kept secret, the Obama administration continued to provide them, albeit with omissions in cases of highly sensitive meetings, such as interviews for prospective Supreme Court candidates and those dealing with national security or intelligence matters. The Obamas also routinely left out the names of celebrities and top donors who attended personal events at the White House, drawing criticism for doing so.\n\nUnder the Presidential Records Act, the public can gain access to records starting five years after the end of an administration, although the president may seek to keep them secret for up to 12 years. The recent attention on the logs arose after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes, confirmed his presence on White House grounds when he received what he described as evidence that President Trump or his closest associates might have been \"incidentally\" swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Logs recording Mr. Nunes' visit on March 21 have not been released to the public.\n\nThe visitor records, maintained by the Secret Service, list the names of those entering, the White House staff member who obtained permission for them to enter, and the name of the person they are to meet. The current policy effectively means that none of the White House visitor logs will be available for at least five years.",
    " Title: US President Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un Convene in Singapore for Historic Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nUS President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore for their highly anticipated summit, marking a significant milestone in the complex relationship between the two nations.\n\nMr. Trump flew in aboard Air Force One, a few hours after Mr. Kim touched down with his entourage. The two leaders are staying in separate hotels, not far from each other, and are preparing for Tuesday's meeting on the resort island of Sentosa.\n\nMr. Kim told Singapore's Prime Minister, \"the entire world is watching.\" Mr. Trump has called it a \"one-time shot\" at peace. The US hopes the summit will kick-start a process that eventually sees Mr. Kim give up nuclear weapons.\n\nThe two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months, trading insults and threatening war before abruptly changing tack and moving towards a face-to-face meeting. Due to the reclusive nature of North Korea, even the plane Mr. Kim would be flying in from Pyongyang to Singapore became the subject of speculation.\n\nThe BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reported that three aircraft took off from Pyongyang - an Ilyushin transport plane carrying Mr. Kim's armored limousine, then an Air China 747 which normally carries the Chinese president, and lastly Mr. Kim's personal jet, a Soviet-era Ilyushin 62. It eventually became apparent that he had arrived in the Air China plane after Singapore's foreign minister posted a photo of him greeting Mr. Kim on Instagram.\n\nSecrecy surrounded the five-star St Regis hotel where he is staying. Only North Korean media workers, dressed in identical black suits, were able to move freely around the building, and tourists taking photos in communal areas were accosted by guards, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nMr. Trump landed in Singapore later in the evening, having flown from a contentious G7 meeting in Canada. He told a reporter he felt \"very good\" about the summit before heading to his hotel, the Shangri La, about half a mile from Mr. Kim's.\n\nMr. Trump's first year in office was marked by bitter exchanges with Mr. Kim as North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of international warnings. The US president vowed to unleash \"fire and fury\" if Pyongyang kept threatening the US. He also referred to Mr. Kim as \"little rocket man.\"\n\nIn return, Mr. Kim called him \"mentally deranged\" and a \"dotard.\" Despite the White House's \"maximum pressure\" campaign, the North remained defiant and carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. Soon after, Mr. Kim declared that his country had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, with missiles that could reach the US.\n\nHowever, in early 2018, North Korea began attempts to improve relations with South Korea by sending a team and delegates to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In March, Mr. Trump surprised the world by accepting an invitation from Mr. Kim - delivered via Seoul - to meet in person.\n\nSince then, the path to the summit has been rocky, with Mr. Trump at one point calling it off completely. But after some diplomatic scrambling, the two leaders will now sit down together. Singapore is only the third country Mr. Kim has visited since he became leader in 2011.\n\nThe US wants North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons in an irreversible manner that can be verified internationally. Only when steps begin to be taken in that direction will it \"receive relief\" from the grip of UN sanctions, according to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the US is expecting to get a final deal in Singapore. President Trump has described it as a \"get-to-know-you situation\" and said, \"It's going to be a process.\" Analysts say that Mr. Kim, by winning the prestige of a meeting with the world's most powerful leader, has already gained a victory. They also question why he would give up his nuclear weapons after pushing so hard to get them.\n\nSome say he would never do it unless everyone else on the Korean peninsula disarmed too - including the US. However, Mr. Kim has also said he now wants to focus on building the North Korean economy - and thus wants sanctions relief and international investment.\n\nThe question is what concessions he is willing to make, and whether he will stick to any promises. Pledges to scrap the nuclear program have been made before by his predecessors. It's hard to say, but Mr. Trump has signaled that they could sign an agreement to formally end the Korean War, which ended in a truce in 1953. Doing that would probably be \"the easy part,\" he said.\n\nThe US president has also said that if he thinks things are going badly, he will walk out of the meeting, but if things go well, Mr. Kim could receive an invitation to the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has met Mr. Kim twice in recent months, said he believed he \"is prepared to denuclearize\" and agree \"big and bold\" changes.\n\nHowever, the North Koreans have not given much away about their position. The historic summit between the US and North Korea is set to take place on Tuesday, with the world watching closely to see if this meeting will mark a turning point in the relationship between the two nations and potentially bring about peace and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.",
    " Title: President Obama Highlights Health Insurance Rebates for Americans Under Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the White House on Thursday, President Obama emphasized the benefits of his signature health care law by highlighting the medical loss ratio provision, which is forcing health insurance providers to return money to consumers. The provision requires insurers to refund customers when they spend less than 80% of premiums they collect on medical care.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, this year, 8.5 million Americans will receive $500 million in rebates later this summer, with the average rebate being about $100 per family. This is a decrease from last year, when 4.1 million people received about $152 per family, or a total of $1.1 billion.\n\nThe speech comes as the Obama administration faces deadlines to establish health care exchanges in all 50 states by Oct. 1 and as GOP lawmakers continue to call for a repeal of the law. The president is looking to emphasize the tangible benefits of the law, even as his administration struggles to fully implement it.\n\nTo drive the president's point home, the White House has invited Americans who have received a refund from their insurance companies to join Obama on stage for his speech. The administration official previewing the president's speech for reporters said, \"What a day like today\u2026 reminds us of is that the Affordable Care Act is about making sure that individuals throughout this country get the peace of mind and security of knowing that they and their families have some insurance that is there when they need it to protect them and their families.\"\n\nHowever, Republican lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, counter that their constituents are seeing rates skyrocket and premium increases would dwarf the rebates. In remarks on the Senate floor on Thursday morning, McConnell called the president's efforts to highlight the rebates \"just another sad attempt by the administration to spin their constituents in Kentucky 'into wanting a law they don't.\"\n\nThe White House says insurers are paying fewer rebates in 2012 than in 2011, in part, because they are more strictly following the law and are charging lower premiums. Additionally, some states, including New York, California, and Oregon, are projecting lower premiums due to health insurance exchanges being set up under the law.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Implement Broader Refugee Ban, Partial Victory Ahead of October Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday granted the Trump administration's request to implement a broader refugee ban, potentially affecting up to 24,000 additional refugees. The ruling comes as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's executive order, which has been a subject of controversy due to its travel restrictions from six Muslim-majority countries and refugee admissions.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling allows the Trump administration to enforce the March 6 order, which suspended travel for individuals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and barred most refugee admissions for 120 days. The order, which took effect in late June following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings, aimed to prevent terrorist attacks and implement more stringent vetting procedures.\n\nLast week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins of legal U.S. residents would be exempt from the travel ban. However, the 9th Circuit also found Trump's refugee policy to be too broad, allowing entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. The Justice Department appealed this part of the 9th Circuit decision, and the Supreme Court sided with the administration in a one-sentence order on Tuesday.\n\nNaureen Shah, Amnesty International USA's senior director of campaigns, expressed concern, stating, \"The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families. They continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.\"\n\nHawaii, which challenged the policy, argued in a court filing that the U.S. government could still bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country. Hawaii's lawyers added that the 9th Circuit ruling only protected vulnerable refugees and the American entities that had been eagerly preparing to welcome them to U.S. shores. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin, in response to the Supreme Court's decision, stated that he respected the court's decision and is preparing for the October 10 hearing.",
    " Title: Rand Paul Moderates Stance on ISIS, Sparks Debate Among Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his traditionally dovish stance, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has recently expressed a willingness to seek congressional authorization for military action against the Islamic State (ISIS). This move, which marks a departure from his long-held skepticism towards military intervention overseas, has sparked debate within the Republican Party and raised questions about the senator's foreign policy stance.\n\nPaul, known for his anti-interventionist views, has been criticized by some for his new approach, with critics labeling it as a flip-flop. In a statement, Paul stated, \"If I were president, I would call a joint session of Congress. I would lay out the reasoning of why ISIS is a threat to our national security and seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.\"\n\nThis shift in rhetoric comes as the Bush era of constant warfare seems to be fading, and many Republicans (and some Democrats) are grappling with the question of how to deal with global hotspots such as ISIS. Mitt Romney, a potential Republican presidential candidate, weighed in on the debate with a Washington Post op-ed, stating, \"Russia invades, China bullies, Iran spins centrifuges, the Islamic State (a terrorist threat \u2018 beyond anything that we\u2019ve seen,\u2019 according to the defense secretary) threatens \u2014 and Washington slashes the military.\"\n\nPaul's critics argue that his new approach risks muddying his message, as he has built a political brand as the politician most wary of foreign entanglements. In a Washington Post op-ed last week, Paul wrote, \"Our Middle Eastern policy is unhinged, flailing about to see who to act against next, with little thought to the consequences. This is not a foreign policy.\"\n\nHowever, Paul's critics also point to his past statements as evidence of his inconsistency. In a 2013 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Paul wrote, \"America Shouldn't Choose Sides in Iraq's Civil War/ Obama has made mistakes but so did Bush by invading. There's no good case for U.S. military intervention now.\" In the same op-ed, he stated, \"The same is true of hawkish members of my own party. Some said it would be \u2018 catastrophic\u2019 if we failed to strike Syria. What they were advocating for then -- striking down Assad's regime -- would have made our current situation even worse, as it would have eliminated the only regional counterweight to the ISIS threat.\"\n\nThe debate over Paul's foreign policy stance is a complex one, with many Americans questioning the role of the United States in global conflicts. As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Paul's evolving stance on military intervention will likely continue to be a topic of discussion among Republicans and Democrats alike.",
    " Title: Fox News Host Critiques President Trump's Budget Signing, Expresses Disappointment over Lack of Border Wall Funding\n\nIn a critical assessment, Fox News host Jesse Watters expressed his disapproval of the budget signed by President Trump on Friday, stating that he did not believe the president's promise to never sign such a bill again.\n\n\"This was a huge defeat for [@POTUS] on a signature issue,\" Watters said. \"It's really, really bad... I know he wanted more money for the military, and that's incredibly important, but he sacrificed everything else to get it.\"\n\nWatters pointed out that the budget allocated only 1.6 billion dollars for the border wall, a significant reduction from the president's initial demands. He also noted that the new concrete wall prototypes surveyed by the president would not be used, and the fencing to be constructed would be limited to repairs and backup fencing for 93 miles, rather than the 3,000-mile border.\n\n\"And the border is a mess,\" Watters continued, \"crying [Senator] Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gets all the money he wants for a tunnel from New Jersey to New York and there's no border wall funding?\"\n\nWatters also criticized the budget for including funding for Planned Parenthood at half a billion dollars and forty million dollars for the John F. Kennedy Center, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) budget reached a historic high.\n\n\"It's really insulting,\" Watters said. \"And he says it's never going to happen again? I don't see how he's going to change the dynamic in Congress to have this never happen again. Democrats are never going to work for border wall funding, and Republicans aren't going to go to the mattresses for it.\"\n\nWatters suggested that the president could seek alternative funding methods, such as having his \"rich billionaire friends pony up\" or privatizing the wall's construction.\n\nTrump initially considered vetoing the budget but ultimately signed it on Friday. Trump allies Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter have expressed concern that the president may face impeachment after losing the House of Representatives to the Democrats in the midterms due to the budget he signed.",
    " Title: Obama's Proposed Universal Preschool Plan: A Mixed Response Amidst Debates on Quality, Cost, and Success\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's plan to implement free, high-quality preschool across the nation is facing a mixed response, with broad support for its potential to aid disadvantaged children but concerns about expanding entitlements and the effectiveness of similar programs. During his State of the Union address last week, the president emphasized the importance of preparing citizens for the new, high-tech economy at an early age.\n\n\"Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road,\" Obama stated. However, less than 30 percent of 4-year-olds are enrolled in a \"high-quality\" preschool program, he noted.\n\nThe president argued that middle-class parents cannot afford the several hundred dollars a week for private preschool, and that poor children, who need help the most, could be at a disadvantage \"for the rest of their lives\" without access to such education.\n\nDuring a visit to a preschool in Decatur, Ga., the president provided more details about the plan, stating that the federal government would match state spending to create high-quality preschool programs for 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families. The plan also reportedly would provide extra federal funding to states that expand their public preschool programs to middle-class families, with tuition paid on a sliding scale.\n\nThe cost of the program remains unclear, but the president argues that investing in high-quality early education will save Americans by increasing graduation rates and reducing teen pregnancy and violent crime. Citing studies from Georgia and Oklahoma, Obama pointed to these programs' positive effects on former students' employment and family stability.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the country is already approximately $16 trillion in debt and question the effectiveness of preschool programs, such as the $7 billion Head Start program, which showed limited benefits after third grade, according to a Department of Health and Human Services study.\n\nKirsten Powers, a Daily Beast columnist and contributor, stated, \"This isn't a liberal or conservative thing. I think everybody wants to help our children do better in school, but this doesn't seem to be the thing that's doing it.\"\n\nAndrew J. Coulson, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, expressed concerns about replicating small, successful pre-K programs on a national level. The Center for American Progress estimates the Obama plan would cost roughly $98 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe liberal-leaning think tank also cited several studies that support Obama's argument about the benefits of preschool education and noted that families making less than $1,500 a month spend about 53 percent of their income on care for their children 4 years old and younger.\n\n\"With all these benefits, universal preschool shouldn't be a partisan issue,\" the group said. \"And indeed, Republican-controlled states such as Oklahoma and Georgia have become national leaders in early childhood education.\"\n\nHowever, Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson told The Wall Street Journal that his state's program, which offers free pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds, works because it \"started locally, is funded locally, and doesn't have a dime of federal money.\"",
    " Title: U.S.-Iraq Tensions Escalate as Washington Rejects Troop Withdrawal Request, Imposes More Sanctions on Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing situation, the United States has rejected an Iraqi request to prepare for the withdrawal of U.S. troops amid heightened U.S.-Iranian tensions following the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. The U.S. is reportedly exploring a possible expansion of NATO's presence in Iraq.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed additional sanctions on Iran in response to an attack on U.S. troops in Iraq launched by Tehran in retaliation for Soleimani's death. Iraq could potentially bear the brunt of any further violence between Iran and the U.S., as its leaders find themselves in a precarious position, with both Washington and Tehran being key allies and influencers in the country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stated in a Fox News interview that Iran had likely planned to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and aimed to strike four U.S. embassies when Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi made a request for preparations for a U.S. troop withdrawal in a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, in line with a vote in Iraq's parliament last week.\n\nThe U.S. State Department stated that any U.S. delegation would not discuss the withdrawal of U.S. troops, as their presence in Iraq is considered \"appropriate.\" The U.S. has $35 billion of Iraq's money \"sitting in an account,\" according to Trump, and he suggested that Iraq would have to pay the U.S. for its investments if they wanted the U.S. to leave.\n\nPompeo also discussed Iran with Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and the opportunity for an expanded NATO force in Iraq and appropriate burden sharing. A NATO delegation is reportedly in Washington to discuss the future of the Iraq mission and a plan to \"get burden-sharing right in the region.\"\n\nThe latest flare-up in the long covert war between Iran and the U.S. began with the U.S. killing of Soleimani on January 3. Iran responded on Wednesday by firing missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq. In the aftermath, both sides have stepped back from further escalation, but the region remains tense.\n\nIraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the U.S.-Iranian struggle happening on Iraqi soil, stating that it risked plunging his country and the wider Middle East into deeper conflict. Iran has increased its calls for U.S. forces to leave Iraq, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stating that ending the U.S. military presence in the region is Tehran's main goal.\n\nHowever, Pompeo stated on Friday that Washington had specific information about an imminent Iranian threat, including to U.S. embassies, adding that \"American lives were at risk.\" Soleimani had reportedly encouraged pro-Iranian Iraqi militias to quell months of protests by Iraqis opposed to the influence of foreign powers such as Iran and the U.S. in their country.\n\nIn Iraqi cities, demonstrators took to the streets again on Friday, determined to maintain the momentum of their protests despite the threat of a U.S.-Iran conflict. Gunmen killed two local journalists covering protests in the southern city of Basra, security sources and state media reported. Ahmed Abdulsamad, Basra correspondent of Dijla TV station, was killed immediately, while his camera operator succumbed to his wounds in the hospital.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains volatile, with tensions between the U.S. and Iran continuing to escalate. The future of U.S. troops in Iraq and the potential expansion of NATO's presence in the country remain uncertain, as both sides seek to assert their influence and protect their interests in the region.",
    " Title: North Korea Accuses U.S. of Gangster-like Tactics in Nuclear Disarmament Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has issued a strong rebuke against the United States, accusing it of using \"gangster-like\" tactics in its pursuit of nuclear disarmament following a recent round of high-level talks. The North Korean foreign ministry, in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, described the U.S. attitude at the meeting as \"extremely troubling.\"\n\nThe statement, issued anonymously, provided a starkly different account from that of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had earlier stated that progress was made during his two-day visit to Pyongyang. The leader's meeting ended with a promise from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to work towards denuclearization, but details on how this will be achieved remain thin.\n\nDuring the talks, Pompeo did not meet with Kim Jong-un, but instead with Kim Yong-chol, who is seen as his right-hand man. In his assessment, Pompeo gave little away, but he did say they had discussed at length a timeline for disarmament, including the destruction of a missile engine testing facility.\n\nHowever, the North Korean statement accused the U.S. of putting unilateral pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, going against the spirit of the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The statement warned that North Korea's resolve for denuclearization may falter if the U.S. continued to demand such concessions.\n\nAfter the Singapore summit, which also saw the U.S. offer \"security guarantees\" to North Korea and promise to end its military drills with South Korea, President Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while U.S. intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nA state department spokesperson said Pompeo had been \"very firm\" in focusing on denuclearization, as well as on security assurances and the return of remains of U.S. service personnel from the Korean War. As Saturday's meeting got underway, Kim Yong-chol joked that Pompeo may not have slept well during his overnight stay at a guesthouse in Pyongyang. Pompeo responded that he \"slept just fine.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S. secretary of state will meet the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea in Tokyo.",
    " Title: Ongoing Protests in Hong Kong Mark 17 Weeks Amidst Trust Deficit and Seismic Identity Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing protests in Hong Kong have entered their 17th week, marking a significant milestone in the city's political crisis that began over the controversial extradition bill. The bill, which has since been withdrawn by Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has sparked widespread unrest and a rupture in trust between Hong Kong residents and the city's institutions, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nDuring an unsanctioned rally on Sunday, protesters reportedly set objects on fire and smashed windows at a train station, according to Bloomberg. In response, hundreds of pro-China supporters held a counter-protest. The following day, hundreds of thousands gathered for a sanctioned rally commemorating the 5th anniversary of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, during which protesters took a stand against the Chinese government. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the prolonged protests in Hong Kong may be a result of both Beijing's overreach and seismic changes in Hong Kong identity. The report suggests that being Hong Konger and being Chinese, long complementary, have come to feel exclusive.\n\nThe 2014 Umbrella Movement emerged after Beijing submitted a proposal that would limit Hong Kong's democracy and not allow the city to vote for its own leader, as reported by The Washington Post. Over the course of a few months, protestors staged sit-in street protests and carried umbrellas against pepper spray from riot police. Police fired 87 canisters of tear gas in 2014. In 2019, police have already fired over 3,000 canisters and hundreds of rubber bullets in an effort to quell the protests, according to the Washington Post.\n\nLooking ahead, Hong Kong residents are reportedly planning to stage a counter-rally during a celebration for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as per The Washington Post.\n\nThe ongoing protests in Hong Kong continue to shape the city's political landscape and identity, with far-reaching implications for the future of the region.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Advances USA Freedom Act, Signaling Potential End to NSA's Phone-Snooping Program\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards reforming the Patriot Act, the House Judiciary Committee has voted for major changes to the act, potentially marking the end of the National Security Agency's (NSA) controversial phone-snooping program. The bipartisan 25-2 vote indicates that both Republicans and Democrats in the House are unlikely to support a full renewal of the Patriot Act, whose key data-collection powers are due to expire at the end of May.\n\nThis development deals a blow to Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has advocated for the retention of the snooping powers to ensure national security. In contrast, House Speaker John A. Boehner has announced his support for the reform bill, which is now set for a vote on the House floor.\n\nThe legislation, known as the USA Freedom Act, aims to rewrite the Patriot Act's Section 215, which authorizes the government to collect records from private businesses. The most prominent use of this provision has been the NSA's program to collect and store phone metadata, including the numbers, times, and durations of domestic calls.\n\nThe USA Freedom Act seeks to prevent the federal government from indiscriminately collecting and storing Americans' data and to increase transparency in the secret court that oversees intelligence collection. The bill also imposes harsher prison sentences for those convicted of providing material support to terrorists.\n\nThe bill, which mirrors a bill that passed the House with bipartisan support last year, aims to end bulk collection and secret laws, and increase transparency within the intelligence community. The program, revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden, has raised privacy concerns among many Americans, leading to efforts to rein in the collection for two years.\n\nRep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican and the author of the original Patriot Act, has expressed his approval of the bill, stating that he has been surprised by the way the Bush and Obama administrations used the act to collect data on every American's phone calls.\n\nThe Senate's stance on the issue remains uncertain, with Senate Democrats generally opposed to McConnell's bill and even some Senate Republicans divided, with hawks supporting it but civil libertarians, including presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, strongly opposing it. McConnell has limited leverage in the debate, as the expiration of Section 215 is imminent, and he may attempt to push for a short-term extension or a lesser alternative to the full extension of all powers.\n\nThe issue appears to be moving away from McConnell, with the biggest threat to the House bill coming not from the hawks but from the other side, where Republicans and Democrats joined forces to limit government searches under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This amendment, however, failed, with some lawmakers expressing reluctance to vote against the carefully crafted consensus.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Mueller and Comey of Conflicts of Interest Ahead of Key Russia Probe Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump launched a broadside at Special Counsel Robert Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey, alleging a series of internal \"conflicts of interest\" and suggesting that these controversies should be included in the final report of the ongoing Russia investigation.\n\nThe president, who had maintained a relatively low profile on social media this week amid services for the late President George H.W. Bush, returned to the Russia probe debate with a blistering barrage of pre-dawn tweets. Trump questioned the impartiality of Mueller and Comey, citing their past professional and personal relationships.\n\n\"Robert Mueller and Leakin' Lyin' James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest. And by the way, wasn't the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of 'legal' at the corrupt Clinton Foundation?\" Trump tweeted, again calling the probe a \"total Witch Hunt.\"\n\nTrump also vowed to produce a \"major Counter Report to the Mueller Report,\" stating, \"This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!\"\n\nThe president's comments came on a critical day for the investigation. On Capitol Hill, Comey arrived Friday morning to speak behind closed doors with two Republican-led House committees, where he will likely be grilled on the Russia and Clinton email probes. Mueller also faces an end-of-day deadline to file briefs concerning the prosecutions of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former personal attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nFor months, Trump has blasted Mueller and Comey, suggesting they have a close relationship. The two have worked together for years\u2014dating back to at least 2003, when Mueller was FBI director and Comey was deputy attorney general.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"woman\" Trump claims is overseeing the potential prosecution of Corsi, an ally of GOP political operative Roger Stone, is likely Jeannie Rhee, a federal prosecutor on Mueller's team. Rhee is a former partner at WilmerHale\u2014the high-profile law firm where Mueller worked prior to taking on the special counsel role. Fox News reported earlier this year that Rhee had represented the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering suit brought by conservative legal activist group Freedom Watch in 2015. Rhee also represented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a lawsuit seeking access to her private emails.\n\nTrump continued his tweets, questioning whether Mueller's \"big time conflicts of interest\" would be listed at the top of his report. He also questioned whether Andrew Weissmann's \"horrible and vicious prosecutorial past\" would be listed in the report, citing Weissmann's controversial prosecutions in the past that resulted in dismissed convictions and allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, a Trump ally, called Weissmann \"one of the most unethical prosecutors to ever be in the Justice Department.\"\n\nThe president, once again, attacked his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller after assuming oversight of the Russia investigation amid former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal. Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who allegedly was a key player regarding the controversial anti-Trump dossier\u2014which was paid for by the Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS\u2014has also come under scrutiny in recent months. Ohr's wife, Nellie, not \"Molly\" as the president tweeted, has worked for Fusion GPS.\n\nThe president's tweets come as Mueller faces a court-imposed Friday deadline to file potentially revealing memos outlining how Manafort allegedly broke his cooperation agreements with the government, as well as how Cohen should be punished for lying to Congress in 2017 about an abandoned Trump real estate project in Russia. The Cohen charge, though, was part of a newly announced plea deal, and the ex-Trump lawyer is said to be cooperating extensively with Mueller.\n\nThe planned submissions are set to come just days after Mueller's office submitted a heavily redacted sentencing memorandum indicating that fired national security adviser Michael Flynn also had provided \"substantial assistance\" with several ongoing investigations and recommending no prison time. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani called Mueller's prosecutors \"sick puppies\" in the wake of that filing.\n\nMeanwhile, Comey is testifying behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees Friday morning, after dropping his longshot legal challenge to congressional Republicans' subpoena earlier this week when they agreed to make public a transcript of his remarks.\n\nFox News has confirmed that a key focus of questioning will be Comey's decision to write the July 2016 statement recommending against filing criminal charges in the Hillary Clinton email probe before the former secretary of state was even interviewed, as well as the apparent political bias demonstrated in a slew of text messages and leaks by top FBI officials.\n\nRepublicans are also expected to ask about the comparably favorable treatment afforded by the FBI to Clinton advisers. In October, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said he was \"shocked\" and \"dumbfounded\" when he learned that the FBI had granted immunity to former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills during its investigation into the use of Clinton's server.",
    " Title: House Democrats File Resolution to Block National Emergency Declaration, Setting Up Clash Over Presidential Powers and Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is set to take place on Friday, House Democrats will file a resolution aimed at blocking President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to finance his proposed border wall. This action is poised to ignite a debate over billions of dollars, immigration policy, and the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nThe resolution, if passed, would likely face a Trump veto, but the ensuing votes will allow Democrats to take a defiant stance against the President, a move that is expected to be well-received by liberal voters. The votes could also put some Republican lawmakers from swing districts and states in a challenging position.\n\nThe House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, seems to anticipate the resolution's approval, stating in a letter that the House will \"move swiftly\" to pass it, and the resolution will be referred to the Senate and then to the President's desk. The measure would then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval.\n\nThe battle is over an emergency declaration that Trump has issued to access billions of dollars beyond what Congress has authorized for border barrier construction. The wall was a prominent campaign promise for Trump. Congress recently approved a spending bill providing nearly $1.4 billion for 55 miles of border barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, while denying Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for over 200 miles of barriers.\n\nBesides signing the bill, Trump also declared a national emergency and used other authorities to access an additional $6.6 billion for wall construction. This money would be transferred from a federal asset forfeiture fund, defense department anti-drug efforts, and a military construction fund. The specific projects affected by these transfers have yet to be identified.\n\nIf the House and Senate initially approve the resolution, it seems unlikely that Congress will muster the two-thirds majorities in each chamber needed later to override a potential Trump veto. However, Republican senators facing tough 2020 re-election fights in competitive states such as Arizona, Colorado, and North Carolina would have to take stances that could risk dividing the GOP's pro-Trump and more moderate voters.\n\nThe moderate Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine has already announced her support for the resolution blocking the emergency declaration, making her the first Republican to publicly state her support for the effort to thwart the emergency declaration. With Republicans holding a 53-47 majority, three more GOP senators would need to vote with Democrats for the resolution to win initial approval.\n\nThe votes could also cause discomfort for other Republicans who have expressed concerns that Trump's declaration sets a precedent for future Democratic presidents to declare emergencies to address their own favored issues, such as global warming or gun control.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Democrats will wait for congressional action to play out before taking legal action. Outside activists suggest that Democrats are likely to file their own lawsuit rather than joining other actions that 16 state attorneys general and liberal, environmental, and other organizations have commenced separately.\n\nCalifornia leads the 16-state lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration. The timeline for legal action is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether Democrats will wait for congressional action to unfold before pursuing legal remedies.",
    " Title: Facebook's Prioritization of Trusted News Sources: A Complicated Relationship and the Question of Trustworthiness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent move, Facebook, the leading social media platform, has announced its intention to prioritize \"trusted\" news sources in its News Feed. The decision, as outlined in a news release by Adam Mosseri, head of Facebook's newsfeed, is based on a survey of US users to gauge their familiarity and trust in various news sources. This move has sparked debate and raised questions about the definition of trust, the role of Facebook in news dissemination, and the implications of this decision.\n\nFacebook, with its 214 million US users, plays a significant role in the dissemination of news, much of which is produced elsewhere. However, the platform has been a breeding ground for fake news, extreme content, and propaganda. In 2016, Russian agents used Facebook to disrupt the US elections, exposing 140 million people to their trolling. Facebook acknowledges this problem, with its product manager for civic engagement admitting that social media could \"corrode democracy.\"\n\nThe relationship between Facebook and the news media is complex. Ad revenue that once supported independent news outlets now primarily goes to Facebook, with the company generating over $27 billion in ad revenue in the first nine months of last year, surpassing Comcast and Disney. Advertising in newspapers and magazines has significantly decreased.\n\nThe question, then, is not how Facebook can determine which news organizations people trust. It's not even whether that's possible. The question is if that's the right question.\n\nFacebook plans to gather its data through a poll. In a post on Facebook, founder Mark Zuckerberg outlined the poll, which asks users about their familiarity and trust in various news sources. The poll, published by Buzzfeed on Tuesday, lists specific news outlets and asks users to rate their trust in these sources on a scale of \"entirely\" to \"not at all.\"\n\nIn his 2002 book, Trust and Trustworthiness, the late political scientist Russell Hardin discusses the complex and often debated nature of trust. Hardin argues that trustworthiness is the raw material of trust, while trust itself is a feeling. Trust, he says, is a three-part relationship: A trusts B to do X. If you only have two elements, that's not really trust.\n\nThis move by Facebook raises questions about the definition of trust, the role of social media in shaping public opinion, and the potential consequences of prioritizing certain news sources over others. As users, we must consider the implications of this decision and the role we play in shaping the information we consume and share.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder Reflects on Legacy, Acknowledges Regrets, and Discusses Future Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced his resignation the day prior, reflected on his career, accomplishments, and regrets. The visit, Holder said, felt like completing a circle, as it was the same courthouse where he won his first big trial as a young public corruption prosecutor nearly four decades ago.\n\nHolder, who became the first African-American attorney general in 2009, spoke about the significant impact the job had on his life. He described it as the best job he would ever have, shaping him as a lawyer and a person. During his emotional farewell speech at the White House, Holder was reminded of his late father, an immigrant who faced racial discrimination, and his mother, who lived long enough to see him become attorney general but passed away before his most significant civil rights accomplishments.\n\nLooking ahead, Holder plans to continue his work on criminal justice issues and civil rights, particularly focusing on the ongoing review of the death penalty, a practice he personally opposes but has authorized several times during his tenure. He also expressed regret over the lack of progress in implementing reasonable gun safety measures following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.\n\nIf he remains at the Justice Department until December, Holder will be the third-longest-serving attorney general in U.S. history. He expressed his intention to continue being involved in public life, aiming to bridge the gap between communities of color and law enforcement. Holder concluded by stating, \"My government service might be over, but I do not think my public life is.\"",
    " Title: The 2016 Republican Presidential Race Takes Shape: A Look at the GOP Field and the Washington Establishment\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race begins to take shape, the Republican Party finds itself in a unique position, with a crowded field of potential candidates and a Washington establishment eager to predict the outcome. For conservatives, the dawn of a new political season brings excitement and hope, as they see an opportunity to challenge the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe GOP field is looking to be so crowded that the first debate may have to be held on an aircraft carrier, with 18 or 20 candidates being mentioned as potential contenders. Among the most often-mentioned are individuals of quality and worth, with impressive resumes and realistic shots at the nomination, if circumstances fall a certain way.\n\nHowever, as with any presidential election, there are bound to be a few \"Doing it to Build my Brand\" campaigns, with candidates running a skeleton crew of neophytes in order to score a few book deals and up their speaking fees. These candidates are often compared to Republican Al Sharpton or, if we want to be more obscure, Mike Gravel, individuals who would be shocked if they won even one primary contest.\n\nOne name that continues to surface is Mitt Romney, who has performed a remarkable comeback in terms of public esteem. However, despite his image improvement and leading in polls, Romney, for all his talk of being a Reagan in waiting, is a cautious and practical man. He is unlikely to take the risks associated with running for president again, given his previous losses.\n\nThere is no frontrunner in the GOP race, and many outside the Washington bubble find it vaguely depressing that America might replay the 1992 election, with a Bush versus Clinton rematch. The voters are being questioned, with some suggesting that they are too lazy to find anyone else.\n\nThe Washington establishment, however, is confident in their predictions, with many favoring Jeb Bush for the nomination. The D.C. crowd is eager to return to Kennebunkport and ride in speedboats, but to many others outside the D.C. bubble, there is a sense of frustration and a longing for a more diverse and exciting field of candidates. The 2016 presidential race is shaping up to be a fascinating spectacle, with the Republican field taking center stage.",
    " Title: Pelosi Suggests Open Discussion on Mueller Indicting Trump, Expresses Support for Mueller's Investigation\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) indicated that it is an \"open discussion\" on whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller could seek an indictment of President Donald Trump. Pelosi, who is likely to become the next Speaker of the House, stated that it is an \"open discussion in terms of the law.\"\n\nDuring the interview, co-host Savannah Guthrie asked Pelosi if Mueller \"should honor and observe the [Department of Justice] guidance that states a sitting president can not be indicted.\" Pelosi responded, \"I do not think that that is conclusive. No, I do not.\"\n\nPelosi later stated that lawmakers should focus on getting results for the American people and wait to see what Mueller reports. She added that \"everything indicates that a president can be indicted after he is no longer president of the U.S.\"\n\nThe comments come as Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow continues into 2019. In December, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison for a series of crimes he committed while working as Trump's personal attorney.\n\nThe sentence occurred after Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges, including campaign finance violations stemming from payments to keep two women quiet after they said they had affairs with Trump more than a decade ago. Prior to Cohen's sentencing, federal prosecutors in New York said in a memo that Trump directed Cohen to make the illegal payments to the women, marking the first time prosecutors made those accusations against the president.\n\nThe allegations have led to scrutiny about the Justice Department guidelines around indicting a sitting president. Sen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) said last month that the evidence presented against Cohen \"might well form the basis for an indictment after the president leaves office.\"\n\nIn a poll released last month, a majority of Americans said they think that a sitting president should be subject to indictment. Seventy-one percent of respondents, including 49 percent of Republicans, said sitting presidents should be subject to indictment, while 21 percent said they should not.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's 4-4 Decision Halts Obama's Immigration Policies, Raises Stakes for Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has dealt a significant setback to President Obama's immigration policies, as a 4-4 decision on Thursday leaves in place a lower court ruling that blocks two controversial programs the White House wanted to implement. The tied vote leaves undecided a program that allows undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to remain in the United States for three years and apply for work permits. It also prevents the administration from expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program issued by Obama in 2012.\n\nThe 4-4 decision marks the most prominent Supreme Court case to stall in such a manner, and it escalates the stakes further in this fall's presidential election. After the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, Obama nominated federal Judge Merrick Garland to the court. However, Senate Republicans, even before that nomination, stated they would not hold a vote or a hearing for anyone nominated by Obama, arguing the pivotal vote on the high court should be determined by the next president.\n\nThe White House and Democrats in Congress have expressed outrage over this move, and Thursday's decision will increase tensions over the Senate blockade. President Obama, in an appearance from the White House press briefing room, criticized the lack of a decision by the eight-justice court. \"The fact the Supreme Court wasn't able to issue a decision today doesn't just set the system back even further; it takes us further back from the country we want to be,\" he said.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) blasted the GOP Senate majority for failing to consider Garland in comments on the Supreme Court's steps. \"This 4-4 decision is clear evidence we need nine justices on the court,\" Durbin said. \"Today's deadlocked decision from the Supreme Court is unacceptable, and shows us all just how high the stakes are in this election.\"\n\nPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to place tough new restrictions on illegal immigration, including the construction of a massive wall along the U.S.'s southern border that he says Mexico will pay for. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement, \"The Supreme Court's ruling makes the president's executive action on immigration null and void.\"\n\nThursday's action does not affect the original DACA decision by Obama that allows certain children who entered or stayed in the United States illegally to remain in the country and apply for work permits. Twenty-six Republican-led states sued the federal government over the expansion of that program, as well as the new program for parents, after the president issued fresh executive actions in November 2014.\n\nThe states claimed they would be burdened by having to spend more on public services like healthcare, law enforcement, and education if undocumented parents of both American citizens and legal permanent residents were allowed to stay in the country. Texas, specifically, said it would be hurt by having to issue more driver's licenses, a benefit that's now subsidized.\n\nSupporters of the administration argued that Texas could pass the added costs for driver's licenses on to residents. They claim the challenging states actually stand to make money off Obama's programs from an increase in tax contributions. A three-judge panel from a federal appeals court in New Orleans said in a split decision the Obama administration lacked the legal power to shield more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and grant them work permits. It handed a nationwide injunction preventing the administration from putting the programs into place. By failing to provide a new ruling on that decision, the Supreme Court's action on Thursday leaves it in place. The actual lawsuit suit filed by the 26 states is still working its way through the court system.\n\nWhen Obama took the action to expand his immigration programs, it was part of a last-ditch effort to take action after Congress failed to pass a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration system that would have offered a path to citizenship for millions of people living in the country illegally. Immigrant rights activists criticized Obama as the \"deporter in chief\" for ramping up the pace of deportations during his first term. Since then, he's taken steps to narrow the focus of immigration enforcement, and his executive actions were seen as a centerpiece of his push to reverse that trend.",
    " Title: State Department Designates Groups Involved in 2012 Benghazi Attack as Terrorist Organizations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the U.S. State Department on Friday designated specific groups and individuals as terrorists in relation to the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya. The move comes as the department labeled Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi and Ansar al-Sharia in Darnah as terrorist organizations, citing their role in the Benghazi attack and other terrorist activities in eastern Libya.\n\nThe State Department also designated Sufian bin Qumu, head of the Darnah branch and a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, and Ahmed Abu Khattalah, head of the Benghazi branch, as terrorists. Fox News previously reported that the two were suspected of playing a role in the attack. According to his Guantanamo file, bin Qumu has historic ties to the Al Qaeda network, including training at Usama bin Laden's Torkham camp.\n\nThe State Department's announcement specifically discussed allegations against the Ansar al-Sharia branches. \"Ansar al-Shari'a in Benghazi and Ansar al-Shari'a in Darnah have been involved in terrorist attacks against civilian targets, frequent assassinations, and attempted assassinations of security officials and political actors in eastern Libya, and the September 11, 2012 attacks against the U.S. Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya,\" the department said. \"Members of both organizations continue to pose a threat to U.S. interests in Libya.\"\n\nInitially, administration officials indicated that the attack was related to protests over an anti-Islam film that were raging elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East, describing it as spontaneous. However, the department has since backed off that explanation, though has not ruled out the film as having played some role. Many lawmakers, though, have claimed the film was not a factor and the attack was planned by terrorists.\n\nThe department on Friday cited Khattalah and bin Qumu over their leadership roles in the al-Sharia organizations. Khattalah, though, told Fox News in October 2012 that while he was at the U.S. consulate that night, he was not responsible for the attack. He claimed he was helping Libyan security workers defending the compound.\n\nThe new terror designation bars anyone from providing or trying to provide \"material support or resources\" to those organizations and individuals, and freezes any assets they have in the U.S. The State Department also announced that it has updated its Rewards for Justice website to include a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone involved in the Benghazi attack.\n\nThe department had faced criticism for not including that reward on the website, though officials claimed reward offers had nevertheless been made. Four Americans died in the 2012 attack, and so far, nobody has been brought to justice in connection with the killings.\n\n\"The U.S. government is committed to taking all appropriate actions against the organizations and individuals responsible for the attacks against the U.S. diplomatic facilities in Libya and Tunisia,\" the State Department said, also referring to a 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tunis.",
    " Title: Fox News Legal Analyst: Quid Pro Quo Not Criminal in Hunter Biden Case, but Trump's Actions Call into Question Fitness for Office\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano has stated that while Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings \"look bad,\" none of them are criminal. Napolitano made these comments on \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday, suggesting that the Chinese practice of offering money to entities associated with individuals to gain a foothold in American society is common.\n\nHunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, announced last week that he was stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and declared he would not engage in any foreign work if his father is elected president in 2020.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden admitted that his involvement with foreign companies provided a platform for critics to attack him over alleged conflicts of interest. \"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\" Biden said. \"So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\"\n\nJoe Biden, who will take the debate stage Tuesday evening along with 11 other Democratic White House hopefuls, has not conducted any sit-down interviews with national broadcast media outlets since President Trump began leveling his attacks against the Bidens last month.\n\nTrump and Republicans have accused Hunter Biden of profiting off his father's office and claim the former vice president is corrupt. However, the Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and there is no evidence of any criminal activity by either of them.\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump last month after revelations emerged that he pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens. Napolitano's comments on the impeachment process were not addressed in the discussion.",
    " Title: Fox News' Role in the Immigration Reform Debate: A Wild Card in the Path to Citizenship for Undocumented Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over a potential path to citizenship for the United States' 11 million undocumented immigrants, Fox News Channel is poised to play a significant role. The question is, will it?\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the proposed immigration overhaul are closely monitoring the nation's most-watched cable news network, which serves as a platform for conservative viewpoints. The network's stance in the rapidly escalating national debate remains uncertain, as it navigates a debate that does not strictly adhere to party lines.\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp., Fox's parent company, is the wild card factor in determining Fox News' direction. Murdoch, an Australian-born U.S. citizen, has become an outspoken advocate for immigration reform and the mass legalization of the country's undocumented immigrants, partnering with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in this cause.\n\nWhether Murdoch's personal views will permeate through his network, or at least temper criticism on the airwaves of those who do not share it, remains to be seen. Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform and a frequent Fox News guest, opposes the widespread legalization proposed by President Obama and a bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week.\n\n\"Rupert Murdoch, first and foremost, is a businessman,\" Mehlman said. \"I'm not sure given all his other troubles he can afford to alienate his own audience.\"\n\nMehlman and other Republican critics of what they call an \"amnesty\" plan believe Fox News could be a crucial ally in the battle for public opinion on immigration. They credit Fox News with helping to amplify their message and derail a similar legislative push that was backed mostly by Democrats and President George W. Bush in 2006 and 2007.\n\n\"That's what stopped the 2007 amnesty because all of a sudden all these members of Congress... were getting called by their constituents saying what are you doing?\" said Rosemary Jenks, the chief lobbyist with Numbers USA, which favors more stringent immigration controls.\n\nHowever, 2013 is shaping up to be a different game, immigrant advocates say, with Fox News potentially emerging as a potential boon.\n\n\"Sean Hannity is in favor, did an 180-degree turn. You're looking at Bill O'Reilly, who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio's principles overwhelmingly. Even Charles Krauthammer has posted and said something needs to be done,\" said Brad Bailey, a self-described conservative Republican and businessman who chairs the Texas Immigration Solution.\n\n\"We need to see more Marco Rubios out there, we need people to come out and rally around them because the solution to this problem is what we need versus the rhetoric,\" Bailey said, suggesting the network could be a valuable forum to court moderates.\n\nBloomberg says much depends on the message Murdoch sends to Fox executives about how to handle the immigration story.\n\n\"The real thing is if he could get Fox to, you know, be the big champion, which sometimes they do, but sometimes they don't,\" the mayor told Politico in an interview last week.\n\nDuring a 2010 hearing on Capitol Hill, both men sat side-by-side as Murdoch told lawmakers it is \"nonsense\" not to provide a \"full path to legalization\" for the millions living and working in the shadows.\n\n\"Requiring unauthorized immigrants to register, undergo a security check, pay taxes, and learn English would bring these immigrants out of a shadow economy and into our tax base,\" he said at the time. He has since been pushing the message on Twitter.\n\n\"Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform, make existing law-abiding Hispanics welcome,\" Murdoch tweeted in November. \"Most are hard-working family people.\"\n\nWhile Fox News' prime-time viewership has been on the decline in recent months, it remains a highly-profitable network with the largest news audience on cable. Its median prime-time viewership was 1.9 million in 2011, according to the Pew Research Center, well ahead of MSNBC (773,000) and CNN (654,000).\n\nStill, many advocates caution against overstating the influence of Fox, insisting the network will not play a decisive role in the immigration debate one way or the other.\n\n\"Talking heads are talking heads. Whatever they say is fine,\" said Jenks of Numbers USA, which opposes the Obama and Senate plans. \"If we had relied on any of the mainstream media in 2007, that bill would have passed. We do not have any intention of relying on them this time.\"\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, says the diversity and bipartisanship of advocates for a reform plan\u2014including a pathway to citizenship\u2014will override any single, particular influence.\n\n\"I think that Fox having the role as a conservative media outlet now, frankly, has in its Rolodex a range of conservative speakers to this issue, whether it's Sen. Marco Rubio; Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals; Richard Land, the head of Southern Baptist Convention\u2014these are conservative leaders who can speak to conservatives who want to see this country move forward with a broad immigration reform,\" Noorani said.\n\nMurdoch has tried to downplay his network's influence on political debate over immigration, too.\n\n\"We are home to all views on Fox. We do not censor that or take any particular line at all. We are not anti-immigrant on Fox News,\" he told the congressional panel in 2010.",
    " Title: Florida ICUs Reach Capacity as Coronavirus Cases Surge, Governor DeSantis Says Death Rate Tapering Off\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a concerning development, at least 56 Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Florida have run out of beds for coronavirus patients, with 35 more reporting bed availability at 10 percent or lower. This comes as Florida recorded over 7,300 new coronavirus cases, 380 new hospitalizations, and 63 additional deaths from the infection on Tuesday.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in Florida, where the governor, Ron DeSantis, acknowledged the strain on hospitals but expressed optimism about the state's handling of the pandemic. DeSantis stated that the death rate in Florida has begun to decrease, with most of the new cases being younger patients.\n\n\"We are prepared for this,\" DeSantis said during a press briefing. \"In places like Miami, you\u2019re seeing increased traffic in the hospitals, but it\u2019s interesting, I was down there today, and they said that they\u2019re actually seeing fewer hospitalizations from people in nursing homes, which is obviously a good sign because that\u2019s where the No.1 risk of mortality is.\"\n\nThe surge in cases is not unique to Florida. Several other states, such as Georgia and California, have also seen a spike in coronavirus cases after reopening large portions of their economies. Georgia surpassed 100,000 positive coronavirus cases on Tuesday, making it the ninth state to reach that number. California recorded a record daily increase of over 10,200 new coronavirus cases and a record 6,000 hospitalized patients on the same day. Some Texas counties have also warned that their hospital ICUs will run out of beds within the next two weeks.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser for the Trump administration's coronavirus task force, cautioned against complacency despite the decreasing death rate. \"It\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,\" Fauci said. \"There\u2019s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don\u2019t get yourself into false complacency.\"\n\n\"The death rate is lower, I admit that. Because people in general, who are young or healthier. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you could not get seriously ill,\" Fauci added.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the U.S. has recorded more than three million positive cases of coronavirus, and 131,200 people in the country have died after being infected.",
    " Title: Judge Rules Against Trump Administration, Restores Obama-Era Offshore Drilling Bans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason has overturned President Trump's executive order that reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean. The decision, made late Friday, reinstates the Obama-era restrictions that were a key part of his environmental legacy.\n\nPresidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development, but they cannot revoke those removals, according to Gleason. She stated that the wording of President Obama's 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely and be revocable only by an act of Congress.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, a defendant in the case, disagreed with the ruling. In a statement, the organization argued that developing offshore resources could provide billions in government revenue, create thousands of jobs, and strengthen national security.\n\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, welcomed the ruling, stating, \"This shows that the president cannot just trample on the Constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans, wildlife, and climate.\" Earthjustice represented numerous environmental groups that sued the Trump administration over the April 2017 executive order reversing the drilling bans.\n\nThe case centered around the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood had argued during a hearing before Gleason in November that environmental groups were misinterpreting the intent of the law written in 1953. He contended that the law was meant to be flexible and sensible, not intended to bind one president with decisions made by another when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time.\n\nIn 2015, Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal, an important area for walrus. In late 2016, he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas, covering about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf. The bans were intended to protect polar bears, walruses, ice seals, and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Obama banned exploration in 5,937 square miles (15,377 square kilometers) of underwater canyon complexes, citing their importance for marine mammals, deep-water corals, valuable fish populations, and migratory whales.",
    " Title: Merkel and Obama to Discuss Ukraine Crisis, Transatlantic Unity Amidst NSA Spying Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House on Friday will be marked by the ongoing tension from last year's revelations of US eavesdropping on her cellphone, but the crisis in Ukraine and the coordination of the transatlantic response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's challenge to European order will dominate the agenda.\n\nFacing the gravest challenge to stability in Europe since the cold war, the two leaders, both pragmatists and practitioners of a cautious and deliberate foreign policy, will be looking to each other for leadership in addressing the Ukraine storm.\n\nMerkel, the Western leader with the closest personal relationship with Putin and whose country has the strongest economic ties to Russia, is expected to argue for a careful \"step-by-step\" approach to Russian aggression, according to transatlantic experts. Merkel was deeply disappointed by Putin's annexation of Crimea and the campaign of destabilization he is carrying out in eastern Ukraine, German experts say, and now believes a tough Western response is in order.\n\nAt the same time, she is likely to encourage President Obama to continue with his approach of coordinating with Europe and prioritizing transatlantic unity over unilateral action, despite the domestic criticism Merkel knows Obama faces for not moving faster.\n\n\"Merkel's response to the crisis has been a little bit tougher than some might have expected,\" says Christopher Chivvis, a specialist in European and Eurasian security at RAND Corp. in Arlington, Va. It's also true, he adds, that because of Germany's leadership role in Europe and its dominant role in relations with Russia, \"what she says has a really big impact in the region.\"\n\nAs a result of Merkel's somewhat surprising firmness and the influential role she plays, Mr. Chivvis anticipates an effort by Obama to enlist Germany to go farther and do more.\n\n\"I would expect the president will try to lean in a little bit on Ukraine,\" he says.\n\nObama has refrained from imposing sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy in part because of European reluctance to go that route. But the president is expected to try to pin down with Merkel what additional Russian actions in Ukraine would trigger tougher measures from the Europeans, including broader sectoral sanctions, US officials say.\n\nOn the Ukraine file, the two leaders will have more than just the issue of sanctions on Russia to keep them busy. Another priority item will be how to help ensure that the national elections Ukraine has scheduled for May 25 go off without major hitches (many regional experts believe Russia is doing everything it can to undermine the vote) and result in a legitimate and authoritative national government.\n\nUkraine's economic survival will also be on the agenda. In addition to her White House visit, Merkel will also meet with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde to discuss what financial and economic help Ukraine will need to get back on its feet.\n\nMerkel is also scheduled to address the US Chamber of Commerce Friday afternoon, focusing on the transatlantic free trade and investment agreement that the US and European Union are hoping to conclude next year. She was planning to dine with a group of US senators upon her arrival in Washington Thursday evening.\n\nYet even as Ukraine receives top billing in Merkel's visit, the outrage she \u2013 and indeed much of Germany \u2013 felt upon learning last year of NSA spying on German leaders, including Merkel, will not be far below the surface.\n\nWhen Obama invited Merkel to Washington earlier this year, she said pointedly that the process of reestablishing trust would take \"more than one trip.\" Germany has pressed for a \"no-spy\" accord with the US like the one the US has with Britain and a few other English-speaking allies, but the US has made it clear it is not prepared to take that step, and Merkel is not expected to insist on that point.\n\nThis willingness to downplay an important issue that risks getting in the way of addressing another will put Merkel's pragmatism on full display. It also provides a stark contrast with the response of another world leader who found her country embroiled in the NSA spying controversy.\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff had been invited for what would have been the only state visit to the Obama White House last year. But with Brazilians still furious over revelations of US spying in their country, Ms. Rousseff called off the visit. US-Brazilian relations have not recovered since.\n\nMerkel also faces heightened anti-American sentiments at home, German experts note. But she also supports a strong transatlantic partnership, these experts emphasize, and she represents a Germany that sees a continuing US leadership role in Europe as all the more important in the era of an aggressive and even expansionist Russia.\n\n\"The Germans want to stay close to the US,\" says Charles Ries, international vice president and expert in European Affairs at RAND. \"They don't want the story [ from Merkel's visit] to be one of divergence.\"\n\nBut Ambassador Ries, who just returned to Washington from Europe, says German leaders and many of their European colleagues want the US to consult with them and take their concerns into consideration even as it retains an active role in Europe.\n\n\"Often they grumble if we don't set out a clear [ path]... but they can also grumble if we do,\" says Ries. \"What they really don't like is when the US seems to be not acting.\"\n\nThat ambivalence presents \"a leadership challenge for the US,\" he says.\n\nSome similar ambivalence will no doubt accompany Merkel into the Oval Office, as she seeks some attention to the NSA spying discord even as the Ukraine crisis dominates the day. Some public expression of understanding from Obama about Germany's spying concerns might be enough to deliver the picture of firm accord on Ukraine the White House wants.\n\n\"If [Merkel] gets that,\" Ries says, it's likely the US \"can get an outcome from the White House visit that [projects] strong alliance unity and resolve.\"",
    " Title: The Education of Poor and Minority Children: A Contentious Issue Amidst Political Agendas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of education policy, one of the most contentious issues is the role of charter schools, particularly in their impact on the education of poor and minority students. The Obama administration, through Attorney General Eric H. Holder, has been criticized for actions perceived as prioritizing the interests of teachers unions over the education of these students.\n\nOne such instance was Holder's attempt to curb the expansion of charter schools in Louisiana. His threats of legal action against schools that disproportionately discipline minority students are equally controversial, with critics arguing they are damaging to the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nCharter schools, often met with resistance from teachers unions and the educational establishment, seem to be particularly targeted when they excel in educating minority students, a demographic that the educational establishment often doubts can be effectively educated. The success of these schools is often attributed to their ability to hire non-unionized teachers and their freedom from adhering to the dogmas prevalent in the educational establishment.\n\nLast year, an attempt was made to shut down the American Indian Model Schools in Oakland, California, schools that consistently ranked among the top in the nation, with top test scores in their district and the fourth-highest scores in the state. The reason given was financial irregularities at the former head of these schools. However, a court order prevented the planned, vindictive closure of this successful charter school serving minority students.\n\nHolder's threats of legal action against schools with disproportionate disciplinary actions against minority students are seen as a broader and more damaging blow to the education of poor and minority students across the country. The presence of disruptive students in many ghetto schools can make education virtually impossible, and if only 10% of the students are disruptive, it can significantly impact the education of the other 90%.\n\nThe idea that Holder, or anyone else, can dictate disciplinary actions in schools nationwide based on racial statistics is both laughable and tragic. Relying on racial statistics tells you nothing, unless one believes that black male students can't be more disruptive than Asian female students, or that students in crime-ridden neighborhoods can't require disciplinary actions more often than children in middle-class neighborhoods.\n\nThe political motivations behind Holder's actions are often questioned. His crusade against requiring identification for voting and his push against school discipline policies are seen as attempts to energize the black vote, a crucial demographic for the Democratic party, particularly in light of weakening support from other voters in the wake of Obama administration scandals and fiascoes.\n\nRobert M. Holland, a senior fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, criticizes these actions, stating, \"To sacrifice the education of children, though, especially children for whom education may be their only ticket out of poverty, is truly a new low.\" He questions, \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\"",
    " Title: BuzzFeed's Unverified Trump Allegations Spark Media Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised questions about the role of journalism, BuzzFeed published an unverified dossier containing allegations against President-elect Donald Trump. The decision, which BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith defended as \"how we see the role of reporters in 2017,\" has been met with criticism from Trump and his team, as well as from within the journalism community.\n\nThe president-elect and his team, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, have denounced BuzzFeed and CNN, which initially reported the existence of the dossier, as \"fake news,\" \"highly irresponsible,\" and a product of \"media bias.\"\n\nThe controversy began when CNN reported that the nation's top intelligence officials had briefed President-elect Trump and President Barack Obama last week about claims of Russian efforts to compromise Trump. While CNN chose not to detail the claims due to their unverified nature, the network's decision to report the existence of the briefing raised doubts about Trump's potential involvement in Russian activities.\n\nBuzzFeed, however, took the decision a step further by publishing the entire 35-page dossier, which includes salacious and unverified allegations about Trump's personal and professional conduct. The dossier, which was compiled by a former British intelligence officer, includes claims that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with Kremlin envoys in Prague last year, a claim Cohen has denied.\n\nThe decision to publish the dossier has been met with criticism from within the journalism community, with some arguing that BuzzFeed's decision to publish unverified allegations without proper context and fact-checking is a departure from traditional journalistic standards.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, stated that his paper had investigated the allegations and had not corroborated them, adding that the Times \"is not in the business of publishing things we can't stand by.\"\n\nBuzzFeed, in response, has defended its decision to publish the dossier, claiming that it is being \"transparent\" with its readers. However, the decision has left many in the journalism community questioning the ethics and standards of modern journalism, with some arguing that the decision to publish unverified allegations without proper context and fact-checking is a departure from traditional journalistic standards.\n\nThe controversy has also put the rest of the media in an uncomfortable position, as they report on an unproven story while trying to dance around the details. Some websites have been happy to repeat the rumors, while others have chosen to refrain from reporting on the story altogether.\n\nThe incident has sparked a larger conversation about the role of journalism in the digital age, with some arguing that the need for speed and clicks has led to a lowering of journalistic standards and an increased willingness to publish unverified information. Others argue that the need for transparency and accountability is more important than ever, and that the public has a right to know about allegations against a president-elect, even if they are unverified.\n\nRegardless of one's stance on the issue, it is clear that the decision by BuzzFeed to publish the dossier has sparked a significant controversy and raised important questions about the role of journalism in the digital age.",
    " Title: Former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert Indicted for Bank Fraud and Lying to the FBI\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal grand jury has indicted former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on charges of attempting to evade currency reporting rules and lying to the FBI regarding payments he made to an individual known as \"Individual A.\" The indictment, unsealed on Thursday, does not detail the nature of the past misconduct, but it paints a picture of a cover-up involving a longtime acquaintance.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Hastert, 73, agreed to pay $3.5 million to compensate for and conceal his past behavior towards Individual A, a person with whom he had a relationship dating back to his time as a high school coach and teacher. From 2010 to 2014, Hastert made cash payments of $50,000 every six weeks to Individual A, with the meetings taking place at prearranged times and locations.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Hastert attempted to evade currency reporting requirements by making smaller withdrawals of less than $10,000 and bundling them to avoid reporting to authorities, as per federal currency transparency laws. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago announced the indictment, stating that Hastert withdrew approximately $1.7 million in cash from various bank accounts and provided it to Individual A.\n\nWhen questioned by the FBI in December about the withdrawals, Hastert is accused of lying to investigators by stating that he was keeping the cash. The indictment further alleges that Hastert structured his cash withdrawals in increments of less than $10,000, in violation of the currency law.\n\nHastert served as House Speaker from 1999 through 2007, holding the longest tenure of any Republican speaker in history. He stepped down after overseeing a disastrous election for House Republicans in 2006 and led the lobbying arm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP, a Washington law firm, until his resignation on Thursday.\n\nThe case was pursued by the FBI and the IRS' criminal investigation division. Hastert did not respond to an email request for comment Thursday evening. He has stepped down from his position on the board of CME Group, according to news reports.\n\nThe indictment states that Hastert has returned about $1.7 million of the $3.5 million he had agreed to pay to Individual A. Of that amount, $952,000 was taken out in increments of less than $10,000, in violation of the currency law.\n\nDuring the FBI's questioning, Hastert reportedly told investigators that he kept the cash. The indictment also suggests that Individual A is a resident of the same town as Hastert and has known him most of their lives. The two are said to have met repeatedly in 2010, and during one of those meetings, they discussed past misconduct by Hastert against Individual A that occurred years earlier.\n\nFormer Rep.

DeLay was found guilty by a jury, but an appeals court later ruled the evidence was insufficient and dismissed the case.",
    " Title: \"Examining Affirmative Action: A Closer Look at the Impact on Asian-American Students in College Admissions\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Department of Justice (DOJ), under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is reportedly investigating potential race-based discrimination in college and university admissions. The New York Times reported that the DOJ is seeking lawyers interested in \"investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.\"\n\nWhile the Times described the intent as \"redirecting resources\" to protect \"white applicants,\" this article will focus on the impact of affirmative action on Asian-American students, who, according to complaints filed by Asian-American groups in 2015 and 2016, are disproportionately affected by race-based discrimination in higher education.\n\nThe complaints presented evidence of a striking level of race-based discrimination in college admissions. For instance, Asian-American students had to score 140 points higher than white students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students, and 450 points higher than black students to gain admission to college. This disparity is compounded by the presence of prohibited quotas, as the college-admission rate for Asian-American students stagnated as their population expanded, similar to the anti-Semitic administrators' practice of capping Jewish students in the past.\n\nAt elite institutions like Yale, the Asian-American student body percentage fluctuated only slightly from 2001 to 2008, never exceeding 13.80% or dropping below 13.50%. This almost decade-long fluctuation of only 0.3% is a clear indication of a quota system.\n\nThe complaints also highlight the damage caused by these discriminatory practices, including stress and mental health issues, pressure to study more, lack of trust in American institutions, self-identification crises, and fortification of racial barriers. For each Asian-American college applicant, such discrimination engenders a feeling that, being Asian American, they are somehow less American than their peers of other racial backgrounds.\n\nThe practice of affirmative action, which is supposed to promote diversity, often increases the admissions chances of wealthy black and Hispanic students over poor Asian-American and white students. White students are often dinged for their alleged \"privilege,\" but what privilege do Asian-American students enjoy? After all, there are still Japanese Americans alive today who spent time in internment camps. The legacy and pain of discrimination is very real, and it is compounded by academic standards that explicitly tell Asian-American students that they have to do more and achieve more than anyone else to enjoy the same access to American higher education.\n\nThe 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes that no state can deny any person within its jurisdiction the \"equal protection of the laws.\" Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, and national origin\" in federally funded educational institutions. However, decades of leftist judicial and regulatory activism have reversed the meanings of these protections, allowing colleges to take discriminatory actions in the name of diversity.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation into potential race-based discrimination in college admissions is a step towards addressing this issue. While it is unlikely that Sessions alone can end this destructive practice, his efforts can at least start a process that is very long overdue.",
    " Title: Mueller's Team Defends FBI Interview Tactics with Michael Flynn Ahead of Sentencing\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a new court filing, special counsel Robert Mueller's team has defended the FBI's interview tactics with former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn, stating that he was not tricked into lying about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The interview, which took place at the White House just days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, was voluntary and lacked any indicia of coercion, according to the court documents.\n\nThe new filings come after Flynn's attorneys suggested earlier this week that the FBI may have duped the former national security adviser by not warning him about the criminal consequences for lying to agents during the interview. The interview, in which Flynn has now acknowledged falsely denying that his conversation with Kislyak included a discussion of Russia sanctions, was arranged by then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was subsequently fired for unauthorized disclosures to reporters. The primary interviewing agent was Peter Strzok, a senior counterintelligence official who was later dismissed for making disparaging comments about candidate Donald Trump in text messages exchanged with an FBI lawyer who was Strzok's girlfriend.\n\n\"A sitting national security adviser, former head of an intelligence agency, retired lieutenant general and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,\" prosecutors said. \"The court should reject the defendant's attempt to minimize the seriousness of those false statements to the FBI.\"\n\nThe new filings come in advance of Flynn's Dec. 18 sentencing. Prosecutors have recommended no prison time for the former Trump administration official who they said has provided substantial cooperation in the ongoing Russia investigation. Flynn's attorneys also have asked that he be spared prison time.\n\nBefore the interview, FBI officials had decided that they would not warn Flynn about the potential criminal jeopardy he faced for making false statements. The interview notes, according to court documents, had been arranged by then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was subsequently fired for unauthorized disclosures to reporters. The primary interviewing agent was Peter Strzok, a senior counterintelligence official who was later dismissed for making disparaging comments about candidate Donald Trump in text messages exchanged with an FBI lawyer who was Strzok's girlfriend.\n\nDespite the questions raised about FBI tactics, prosecutors continued to support leniency for the former administration officer, who will be the first former White House official to be sentenced in Mueller's continuing inquiry. Last week, Mueller's prosecutors provided an account of Flynn's extensive cooperation, citing the former three-star general's \"substantial\" assistance to the Russia inquiry and at least two other undisclosed investigations in recommending that he serve no prison time. Flynn, according to prosecutors, has met with investigators 19 times since he pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak during the run-up to Trump's inauguration.\n\nProsecutors have lauded Flynn's assistance, claiming that his early guilty plea and decision to cooperate \"likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the (special counsel\u2019s office) and cooperate.\" Flynn, who memorably called for the jailing of Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Republican convention, discussed U.S. sanctions with Kislyak on Trump's behalf during the presidential transition and said members of the president's inner circle were aware of, and in some cases directing, his efforts, according to the plea. Flynn had urged Kislyak not to respond to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to Russian election interference. Flynn's FBI interview came just weeks before he was forced to resign in February 2017. The White House said he was fired for misleading Pence and other senior officials about the content of his conversations with Kislyak. As part of his plea, Flynn also admitted to lying about Turkish lobbying and research work. He belatedly registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work weeks after he left the White House.",
    " Title: Key Lawmakers Raise Concerns Over Obama Administration's Plan to Send F-16 Fighter Jets to Egypt Amid Uncertainty Surrounding President Mohamed Morsi\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - Key lawmakers have expressed concerns about the Obama administration's plan to send 20 F-16 fighter jets to Egypt, as the allegiances of President Mohamed Morsi remain uncertain and his grip on power is questioned. The U.S. is set to deliver the planes to Egypt's air force, which already possesses over 200 of the aircraft, under a foreign aid deal signed in 2010, when Morsi's U.S.-friendly predecessor Hosni Mubarak was in power.\n\nThe first four jets are scheduled to be delivered beginning January 22, according to a source at the naval air base in Fort Worth, where the planes have been undergoing testing. The $213 million gift, however, is raising questions on Capitol Hill as Morsi is under fire for attempting to seize dictatorial powers and allegedly siccing thugs and rapists on protesters.\n\nFlorida Rep. Vern Buchanan, who recently called for ending foreign aid to Egypt altogether, said the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Morsi government has been sending increasingly troubling signals to Washington, and giving it state-of-the-art fighter jets is a dangerous idea.\n\n\"American tax dollars must not be used to aid and abet any dictatorial regime that stands with terrorists,\" Buchanan said.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told FoxNews.com that Egypt is a wild card under Morsi.\n\n\"At this point, we do not know where Egypt is headed,\" Thornberry said. \"We should be cautious about driving them away, but we should also be cautious about the arms we provide.\"\n\nLast week, vigilante supporters of Morsi captured dozens of protesters, detaining and beating them before handing them over to police, according to human rights advocates. Morsi-backed groups have also been accused of using rape to intimidate female protesters who have gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to protest a Sharia-based constitution and Morsi's neutering of the nation's legal system.\n\nThe U.S. government ordered and paid for the fighter jets for Egypt's military back in 2010. However, since Mubarak's ouster, the democratically elected Morsi has sent mixed signals about whether he wants an alliance with Washington, even meeting with leaders in Iran earlier this year.\n\n\"The Morsi-led Muslim Brotherhood government has not proven to be a partner for democracy as they had promised, given the recent attempted power grab,\" a senior Republican congressional aide told FoxNews.com.\n\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, recently criticized U.S. military aid to Egypt:\n\n\"The Obama administration wants to simply throw money at an Egyptian government that the president can not even clearly state is an ally of the United States,\" Rep. Ros-Lehtinen said.\n\nThe package had to be approved by lawmakers in Washington. While the basic F-16 has been a military workhorse for top air forces for more than 25 years, the cockpit electronics are constantly updated, and the models Egypt is getting are the best defense contractor Lockheed Martin makes.\n\n\"This is a great day for Lockheed Martin and a testament to the enduring partnership and commitment we have made to the government of Egypt,\" said John Larson, vice president, Lockheed Martin F-16 programs. \"We remain committed to providing our customer with a proven, advanced 4th Generation multirole fighter.\"\n\n\"In an air combat role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft,\" the U.S. Air Force description of the plane reads.\n\n\"The F-16 can fly more than 500 miles, deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during non-visual bombing conditions,\" the U.S. Air Force description continues.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. and Egypt have an important alliance that is furthered by the transfer.\n\n\"The U.S.-Egypt defense relationship has served as the cornerstone of our broader strategic partnership for over thirty years,\" said Lt. Col. Wesley Miller. \"The delivery of the first set of F-16s in January 2013 reflects the U.S. commitment to supporting the Egyptian military's modernization efforts.\"\n\nHowever, Malou Innocent, a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute, warned that Egypt's murky intentions could lead to the prospect of U.S. ally Israel facing an air assault from even more U.S.-made planes.\n\n\"Should an overreaction [by Egypt] spiral into a broader conflict between Egypt and Israel, such a scenario would put U.S. officials in an embarrassing position of having supplied massive amounts of military hardware\u2026 to both belligerents,\" Innocent said. \"Given Washington's fiscal woes, American taxpayers should no longer be Egypt\u2019s major arms supplier.\"",
    " Title: Former BBC Director General Mark Thompson Clarifies Knowledge of Jimmy Savile Abuse Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to a British lawmaker, the former Director General of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Mark Thompson, has attempted to clarify his knowledge of a journalistic investigation into sexual abuse claims against Jimmy Savile, a late children's TV presenter. The investigation, which was dropped in late 2011, has been at the center of a series of sexual abuse allegations against Savile, a household name in Britain.\n\nThompson, who was the head of the BBC at the time of the investigation, provided conflicting statements this week regarding what he knew about the allegations and when. In a statement on Monday, he stated, \"I was not notified or briefed about the 'Newsnight' investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation.\" However, in a New York Times article, Thompson was quoted as saying that a BBC reporter informed him about the investigation at a party in December.\n\nIn a letter to British MP Rob Wilson, Thompson offered an explanation to reconcile his two statements. He explained that he learned of the investigation but not its details and was satisfied when he inquired to his senior management and was told that it had been dropped for journalistic reasons.\n\nThe controversy has gripped the UK media, with many questioning who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of young teenage girls. The scandal threatens lasting damage to the reputation of the UK's public broadcaster. Savile died in October last year at the age of 84.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police in London launched a criminal investigation into claims of child sexual abuse by Savile and others, with more than 200 potential victims identified. The BBC said on Monday that the editor of 'Newsnight' was \"stepping aside\" over questions about why his show never broadcast its investigation into Savile.\n\nThe controversy has prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the BBC in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior. The allegations against the famous Savile are a reminder of how little the public really knows about celebrities, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.\n\n\"It's another one of these instances that shows us whenever there's someplace we think we won't see scandal, eventually, we end up seeing it,\" he said. The scandal brings the venerable BBC into question and feeds the state of cynicism that the public feels for media institutions.",
    " Title: Colin Kaepernick Announces Memoir Release and Launches Publishing Company Focused on Voices of Color\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has been out of the NFL since 2017, has given his first extensive interview in four years to USA Today and announced the release of his memoir. The memoir, yet to be titled, will be published under his own publishing company, Kaepernick Publishing, in partnership with Amazon-owned Audible.\n\nIn the interview, Kaepernick discussed the inspiration behind his protest against police brutality and social injustice during NFL games, stating, \"I've had a lot of questions surrounding what got me to the point of protesting. Which led me to wanting to share that story and give insight.\"\n\nThe memoir, described as a blend of political awakening and personal memoir, will delve into the life experiences that led Kaepernick to risk his career as a star NFL quarterback in a silent act of protest.\n\nKaepernick, 32, expressed his commitment to promoting voices of color through his publishing company. Kaepernick Publishing will focus on giving power to black and brown voices globally, offering unprecedented ownership options to collaborators and bringing greater diversity and representation to literature and spoken word.\n\n\"It's not just my control over stories,\" Kaepernick told USA Today. \"We wanted to be able to put the power back into the hands of the people that are telling the stories and the people that are writing the stories and creating them.\"\n\nKaepernick's activism off the field includes the creation of the Know Your Rights Campaign, which hosts camps to raise awareness on higher education, self-empowerment, and instructions on how to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios. He also signed an endorsement contract with Nike in 2018, which included a viral commercial and the \"True to 7\" Kaepernick-branded version of the Air Force 1 sneaker last December, named after the star athlete's jersey number.\n\nDespite being unsigned by any NFL team since 2017, Kaepernick has sued the NFL for colluding to keep him and former teammate Eric Reid out of the league. They reached a surprise settlement for less than $10 million in February 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal. Kaepernick Publishing was established a month later, according to filings with the New York Department of State reviewed by the New York Times.\n\nHowever, Kaepernick remains hopeful about returning to the NFL, stating, \"My desire to play football is still there. I'm ready to go, I'm ready for a phone call, tryout, workout at any point in time. I'm still waiting on the owners and their partners to stop running from this situation. So I hope I get a call this offseason. I'll be looking forward to it.\"\n\nIn a separate development, a football team has reached out to Kaepernick, but the team is not one of the 32 NFL teams, according to a report by USA Today. The specific team and the nature of the outreach were not disclosed.",
    " Title: Louisville Police Department Terminates Officer Involved in Breonna Taylor Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department has terminated the employment of Officer Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the March shooting of 26-year-old emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor. In a letter to Hankison, the department's chief called his conduct \"a shock to the conscience.\"\n\nTaylor was fatally shot on March 13, when officers entered her home in search of illegal drugs. The official narrative claims the officers knocked on the door and announced themselves, and only started shooting after they were \"immediately met by gunfire\" from Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. However, Taylor's family contends in a lawsuit that the officers did not identify themselves, and that Walker, a licensed gun owner, thought someone was trying to break in.\n\nThe letter states that Hankison was found to have violated two standard operating procedures: obedience to rules and regulations and use of deadly force. Hankison allegedly violated the first procedure by \"wantonly and blindly firing ten (10) rounds\" into Taylor's apartment, creating a substantial danger of death and serious injury to Taylor and the three occupants of the adjacent apartment.\n\nIn addition, Hankison violated the department's use of force procedure by firing the rounds \"without supporting facts that your deadly force was directed at a person against whom posed an immediate threat of danger or serious injury to yourself or others.\" The letter further states that three of the rounds Hankison fired entered the apartment next to Taylor's, endangering the three lives in that apartment.\n\nChief of Police Robert Schroeder wrote in the letter, \"Based upon my review, these are extreme violations of our policies. I find your conduct a shock to the conscience. I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. You have never been trained by the Louisville Metro Police Department to use deadly force in this fashion.\"\n\nThe three officers involved in the shooting\u2014Hankison, Jon Mattingly, and Myles Cosgrove\u2014had all been placed on administrative reassignment throughout the investigation. None of the officers have been charged, despite widespread protests and calls for arrests.\n\nIn the aftermath of Taylor's death, Louisville passed a ban on \"no-knock\" warrants, which allow police to enter a home without first announcing their presence.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking in Elections: A Growing Trend with Limited Impact on Politicians and Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential and vice presidential debates unfold, fact-checking has emerged as a significant aspect of the election process. According to political historian Julian Zelizer, the process of fact-checking has grown tremendously, with websites and news shows inundated with experts and reporters informing voters about the veracity of candidates' claims. However, Zelizer questions whether the public is paying attention to the results or if there is any real impact on the politicians themselves.\n\nThe fact-checking landscape resembles a game of \"B.S.,\" where players call out fellow players when they lie about the cards in the pile. Fact-checkers are shouting out to Americans when they find politicians are injecting falsehoods into the news cycle. Yet, it remains unclear whether fact-checkers are having a significant impact on the public at large or on the politicians themselves.\n\nPoliticians continue to stretch the truth or fabricate facts, with little evidence that the public is outraged by the revelations or that it has any real influence on their behavior, other than providing fodder for campaign attacks on opponents. The polls do not seem to be registering any significant effects when candidates are called out for lying.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for fact-checkers is working in a political culture that has been deeply distrustful of government and politicians since the 1970s. Trust in government has steadily fallen since the Vietnam War, with just a few temporary upticks. The public does not think much of politicians, nor do they expect them to tell the truth.\n\nFact-checkers also operate in a media environment that has become more polarized and openly partisan in recent years. As objectivity norms weaken in many news outlets, and reporters become more vocal about their political views, Americans tend to rely on websites and television stations that align with their preferred partisan slant. It is difficult for any source to break through this belief.\n\nObjective fact-checkers must also compete with openly partisan fact-checkers. Political parties and other organizations have turned these operations to their own ends, releasing information attacking the veracity of their opponents, playing into an argument that has become important to their campaign. It is hard for people to distinguish between partisan and real fact-checkers.\n\nPartisanship has many costs, including Congress's difficulty in making decisions, severe tensions among voters over certain issues, and a decline in the quality of discourse. One of the worst effects of partisanship, however, is that the truth is much harder to discern, and in many cases, voters do not even expect it.\n\nFact-checkers, with legitimate and virtuous objectives to help Americans understand the choices before them, have trouble gaining much traction. When one of the players calls \"B.S.\" during the political cycle, people might be listening, but it's not clear that there are lasting consequences.",
    " Title: House Committee Subpoenas Former Trump Administration Official Over Security Clearance Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move aimed at investigating potential security risks within the Trump administration, the Democrat-led House Committee on Oversight and Reform has voted to subpoena Carl Kline, a former personnel security director for the first two years of the Trump presidency. The subpoena is based on testimony from a whistleblower, a longtime White House security adviser who alleged that security clearances were granted to individuals despite concerns from lower-level officials.\n\nThe committee voted along party lines, with Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) stating, \"The White House cannot stonewall and stall this committee for months and then just offer us general information about their policies, not when there are such serious allegations of a risk to national security.\"\n\nTricia Newbold, a career employee who has returned to work at the White House, testified, \"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security.\"\n\nThe group of 25 applicants, which may include President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was reportedly recommended for rejection due to ties to foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems, and drug abuse, according to testimony.\n\nThe committee did not identify the 25 applicants, but in the past, they have asked the White House to provide information about clearances for Kushner, his spouse (and the president's daughter), Ivanka Trump, and national security adviser John Bolton. The White House has rejected these document requests, citing privacy and arguing that Congress does not have the authority to see these documents.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders stated, \"We're not going to exploit individuals and their personal information.\" Speaking with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday, Kushner said, \"I did not want to discuss the clearance process, but I can say over the last two years that I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false.\"\n\nHouse Democrats are planning subpoenas in a number of investigations of the Trump White House. The House Judiciary Committee will meet Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report and the evidence his investigators gathered, setting up what could be a historic legal clash with the Justice Department. The panel also plans to vote to authorize subpoenas for evidence from some of Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Donald McGahn, and counsel Ann Donaldson.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, accused Cummings and the Democrats of politicizing security clearances and exaggerating the problems. \"For instance,\" he said, \"the 25 examples of overruled recommendations by Ms. Newbold heralded by the Democrats include nonpolitical officials such as a GSA custodian.\"\n\nCummings responded, stating that the evidence suggests the administration has been careless with security clearances and access to the nation's secrets. Newbold's testimony reflected \"the grave security risks she has been witnessing firsthand over the past two years,\" Cummings said.",
    " Title: U.S. Diplomats Call for Military Pressure on Syria's Assad Regime: A Rare Display of Internal Dissent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, more than 50 U.S. State Department officials have signed an internal memo advocating for a shift in the United States' approach to Syria, urging military pressure on the regime of Bashar Assad to compel him to the negotiating table. This dissenting view, expressed through the State Department's dissent channel, is unusual given the number of officials involved.\n\nAccording to NPR's Michele Kelemen, the cable reportedly calls for targeted military strikes against the Assad regime, a move the Obama administration has been hesitant to undertake. Such action would potentially place the U.S. in a confrontational position with Russia, a key ally of the Assad regime.\n\nThe New York Times, which has obtained a copy of the memo, reports that the diplomats argue that a credible military threat against Assad is necessary to pressure him to negotiate. They maintain that they are not advocating for a confrontation with Russia.\n\nThe cable, according to the Times, states, \"The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable. The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic, and terrorism-related challenges.\"\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired members of the Foreign Service, issued a statement praising the constructive dissent. \"America's diplomats are tasked with addressing some of the world's most complex challenges in order to protect America's people and national security\u2014a charge that requires a professional environment that values candor and debate when the stakes are high and the costs of failure are unacceptable,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe dissent channel was established in 1971 during the Vietnam War and is meant for \"dissenting and alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues.\" Messages sent through the channel are immediately distributed to the secretary of state and other department leaders. Cables sent through the channel are supposed to remain confidential.\n\nIn 2004, Michele reported on the State Department diplomats who expressed their objections to the war in Iraq. At the time, she reported that about six messages a year were sent through the channel. \"One little lonely voice out in the wild reaches of Mongolia was certainly not going to turn the train of war around,\" one diplomat who sent an anti-war dissent cable told Michele. However, even if it wouldn't change history, the diplomat wanted her concerns put in writing and read by the country's top diplomat.",
    " Title: Trump's Controversial Pardons Raise Concerns Over Cult of Personality and Potential Abuse of Pardon Power\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked criticism from the left, former President Donald Trump has issued a series of pardons that have raised concerns about the impact on the government's anti-corruption efforts and the potential for an abuse of the pardon power.\n\nThe pardons, which were granted to four individuals with personal connections to Trump, have been criticized as being self-serving and politically motivated. The common link among the four is that they all have some personal connection to the President.\n\nRod Blagojevich, a former Illinois governor, was a contestant on 'Celebrity Apprentice' and was prosecuted by Patrick Fitzgerald, a close friend of and lawyer for James Comey. Jeffrey Skilling, the former CEO of Enron, was a regular attendee at Milken's annual financial conferences, a favorite meeting place for Trump's moneyed friends. Bernard Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, was appointed by Rudolph Giuliani. Edward DeBartolo, a former San Francisco 49ers owner, had his cause championed by a large group of former professional football players, whose favor Trump has often sought.\n\nThe pardons were entirely personal in origin, and so the granting of them was exclusively an exercise of Trump's own power. That was their point. A benevolent leader dispensed favors. The world will not change much because of these actions; of the four, only Blagojevich was still incarcerated.\n\nThe only cost is the further degradation of the government, moving our system closer to a cult of personality. Trump also has been repeating a false description of the Blagojevich case, claiming he was only charged for what he said on one phone call that could have been just talk. In fact, the charges related to a month's worth of discussions and three separate corruption-related incidents.\n\nObjectionable as these grants of clemency may be, they also raise concerns about what would be an even more outrageous abuse of the pardon power: clemency for convicted Trump associates such as Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chairman, and Roger Stone. A principled president will exercise this power in the interests of mercy, not because the recipients of clemency are prominent or political bedfellows or well-connected or cronies of the president himself. Trump, however, seems to see the pardon power as a way to reward supporters and score political points.\n\nTrump's exercise of the pardon power has been at best whimsical and at worst self-serving and blatantly political. The president would be committing an even worse corruption of the pardon power if he used it to annul the convictions of figures such as Manafort and Stone.\n\nTo be clear: Presidents do have this unquestioned pardon power. And past presidents have used it to pardon or commute the sentences of acquaintances or friends of friends - the most famous being Bill Clinton's pardon of financier Marc Rich in his final days in office. Many have done so at a higher rate than Trump. But no past president has been as transparently transactional in doling out clemency as Trump. Friend? Friend of a friend? Famous? You've got a very good chance of being considered for a pardon in Trump world.\n\nRegarding Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, her talents have always lain in the less glamorous, less public side of politics. She is good at whipping up votes in her caucus and she is good at disciplining dissenters. She is good at offering incentives and punishments to get Democratic members of Congress to do what she wants them to do. To rip up the speech on television was a bit of theatricality, sure - a ploy designed to get attention. It also worked. The day after Trump made a long speech full of misinformation that tried to make a case for his re-election, no one is talking about him. Instead, we are talking about the speaker of the House. That, too, is a skill, one that Pelosi seems to be honing.",
    " Title: Millennial Voters Shift Toward Libertarian Candidates as Clinton Underperforms with Young Demographic\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of recent polls indicate a significant shift in the preferences of young voters, with Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson performing well among this demographic, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is underperforming compared to her performance with the same group in previous elections.\n\nAccording to a New York Times/CBS poll, 26 percent of voters under the age of 29 support Johnson, with another 10 percent backing Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein. A Quinnipiac poll shows Johnson at 29 percent of young voters, and Stein at 15 percent. In the same poll, Clinton barely edges out Johnson among young voters, receiving 31 percent, while Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is at 26 percent. A Global Strategy Group poll of millennials in 11 battleground states found 73 percent of millennials labeling Trump as a racist, and just 38 percent supporting Clinton in a four-way matchup.\n\nThe poll results have sparked concern among older liberals who feel that the millennial vote belongs to them. Clara Jeffrey, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that she has \"never hated millennials more\" in response to the NYT/CBS poll, which drew refreshing responses from millennials. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat quipped that it looked \"like 'liberaltarianism' is a real thing\" and that Donald Trump was \"very glad\" of it.\n\nWhile Republicans have a few politicians who could be called 'liberaltarian,' Trump is not. In a tight race, those votes could be crucial, and Trump has nothing to offer them. Similarly, the Democratic nominee has nothing to offer a demographic that has increasingly become more libertarian-friendly.\n\nA 2014 poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588-Rupe found 66 percent of millennials believing government was wasteful and inefficient, even as many said they planned to vote Democrat in that year and in 2016. The drop-off in support for Democrats is unsurprising, given that the rhetoric about government that Democrats deploy does not match the reality on the ground.\n\nThe narrative of older generation liberals is that Donald Trump is so bad, voters have to hold their nose and vote for Clinton. The option of a third-party vote is often skewered online, mostly by establishment liberals who have increasingly come to represent the poor policy-making that has led to a mammoth-sized debt and veritable police state in the U.S. and U.S. warfare state abroad. Donald Trump does not \"scare\" millennials as much as the mess older voters have made of the country. Clinton's courting of neo-conservatives and figures like Henry Kissinger only serves to alienate millennials more.\n\nJohnson's refusal to play political games, like powering through a question about Aleppo without knowing what it's in reference to, while it makes him an easy target for the media establishment to mock, likely ingratiates him to millennials who see both Trump and Clinton as products of a corrupt political system their parents' generation has glorified.\n\nClinton and President Obama's decision to call Trump a break from Republican tradition instead of the inevitable evolution of it, as more dishonest partisans might frame it, has also placed Johnson and the Libertarian Party in a better position. Millennials are used to start-ups. They are early adopters whose behaviors and decisions are helping drive old giants of industry out of business, from Blockbuster to taxicabs. The latest polls suggest they have the potential to disrupt the political industry in this country in the same way they've disrupted so many others.\n\nAll the fearmongering over Trump, the cries of false equivalency, and the attempts by millennial \"influencers\" like Vox.com to frame the Clinton campaign as something transformative millennials ought to get behind, won't bring millennials to heel in the way major parties were able to in days gone by. Neither will false alarms about \"spoilers\" (spoiler: third parties are not spoilers, shitty candidates are).\n\nThe persistence of never Trump Republicans (even if they do not go for Johnson) combined with Obama and Clinton's refusal (as of yet) to smear the principles of limited government, freedom, and Constitutionalism with Trumpism because of Republicans' history of running on those principles while never acting on them, and the Libertarian party's decision to nominate socially tolerant and fiscally responsible candidates (as many millennials describe themselves) means millennials have the chance to catapult the Libertarian party into major party status, if not through this election cycle alone, almost certainly in cycles to come. Both millennials and Libertarians should expect the smears and attacks to become more vociferous and detached from reality as the old establishment partisan order slowly but surely comes to an end.",
    " Title: \" Trump and Biden Take Divergent Approaches in Responding to Nationwide Protests and Unrest\"\n\nThe ongoing protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd have dominated the national conversation for the past two weeks, with no signs of abating. As the presidential election approaches, these issues of police violence and civil unrest are likely to remain at the forefront.\n\nThe two candidates have taken drastically different approaches in their responses to the protests. President Donald Trump has emphasized a return to \"law and order,\" going as far as to suggest invoking his authority to deploy the U.S. military in American cities. In contrast, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has attempted to strike a more unifying tone, speaking out about the need to address \"systemic racism\" in the country.\n\nThe last time the country experienced such widespread unrest was in 1968, during one of the most chaotic periods in American history, marked by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and deadly riots in several cities. Republican Richard Nixon, who ran to replace a Democrat in the White House, emphasized a return to \"law and order\" en route to a decisive win over Democrat Hubert Humphrey.\n\nBy echoing Nixon's message, Trump could appeal to voters who crave a return to stability. The intense focus on police violence also draws attention away from the administration's response to the coronavirus, which voters largely see as a failure, according to polls. The coming months may provide the president with an opportunity to capitalize on divisions within the various wings of the Democratic Party, such as the debate over defunding the police.\n\nHowever, some argue that an election 52 years ago shouldn't be treated as indicative of what might happen today. Moreover, Trump's appeal to order could be effective, but he may not be the right candidate to capitalize on that opportunity given the upheaval he's brought to Washington during his presidency, political analysts argue.\n\nEarly polling suggests that Trump's response is hurting rather than helping. Trump's focus on order could be convincing for some voters, but his history and the progressive minded view \"law and order\" as code words for racial intolerance. On the other hand, Biden's history makes him a poor messenger for police reform, given his past support for punitive criminal justice measures.\n\nThe focus on race relations turns attention away from the coronavirus, with the President betting that suburban voters disgusted that he ignored the pandemic until it was too late will swing right as he invokes the specter of lawlessness and race riots and social turmoil. Not unhappily for Trump, Minneapolis, a largely Democratic city in a reliably blue state, provides a platform for him to campaign on the failure of Democratic state leaders to answer the needs of black voters.",
    " Title: Trump Shifts Tone for State of the Union Address: From \"Fighter\" to \"Winner\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in strategy, President Donald Trump is expected to adopt a more optimistic tone in his State of the Union address, moving away from his combative style to promote the booming economy and the enactment of his tax plan. This transition, according to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has advised the president, is a move towards \"Trump the winner\" rather than \"Trump the fighter.\"\n\nGingrich stated on Monday, \"There's more of a sense of, 'I'm the president of the United States. I don't need to pick a fight.'\"\n\nWhile some of Trump's advisers may yearn for a darker and more strident tone from the president, White House officials are aiming for a more inclusive speech, both in tone and in the collaborative process of its creation. The speech has been put together by Stephen Miller, another speechwriter, and Rob Porter, the president's staff secretary, with input from other parts of the government.\n\nVince Haley, another speechwriter, and Porter have been instrumental in the speech's creation, aiming for a more unifying and positive message. This shift in tone is a response to the president's tendency to stray from the script, often inserting divisive remarks, insulting asides, and non-sequiturs that overshadow the intended message.\n\nOfficials believe that as long as Trump adheres to his script, resists the urge to respond to perceived slights or settle scores, and instead focuses on a positive message, he will be viewed favorably in many quarters. Corey Stewart, a Tea Party Trump backer from Virginia running for Senate in the state, commented, \"The president is looking forward to the midterm elections in November and his own election in 2020. He knows that he's going to have to get his base out, but also expand it by talking about non-red meat issues.\"\n\nThis shift in tone is a strategic move by the president, aiming to appeal to a broader audience and potentially win over undecided voters, while still maintaining his base's support. The State of the Union address is set to be delivered on January 30.",
    " Title: \"Political Polarization in the United States: A Historical Perspective on the Fate of Moses Dunbar During the American Revolution\"\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical polarization in the United States, as evidenced by the deep-seated divisions between Democrats and Republicans, is not a new phenomenon. A study by the Pew Research Center in June 2016 revealed that majorities in both parties held highly unfavorable opinions of their opponents, with many admitting to fearing the rival party's political agenda. This intense polarization has persisted, if not intensified, since the surveys were completed.\n\nThis article delves into a lesser-known episode of political polarization in American history, the 1790s, when the country was torn apart by fierce discord between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans over the French Revolution and domestic policy. The era also saw the birth of the nation, as the Revolution was not only a struggle against Britain but also a civil war, dividing colonists who supported independence from those who did not.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of the consequences of extreme partisanship during this time is the story of Moses Dunbar, a Connecticut farmer who sought to remain neutral but was executed for treason in 1777. Dunbar, who made no secret of his allegiance to the king, rejected the patriots' eagerness to resort to arms instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the \"Unhappy Misunderstanding\" between Britain and the colonies.\n\nOnce the war began in April 1775, such calls for moderation had little chance of being heard. Fear of British military retaliation drove Connecticut patriots to identify suspected loyalists and subdue them by any means possible. Dunbar, like many others, suffered beatings from patriot gangs and was eventually arrested, convicted of treason, and executed.\n\nDunbar's execution served as a warning to other suspected loyalists, but it also marked a turning point in the nation's approach to political polarization. In the aftermath of the war, many loyalists fled the United States, but many more stayed, including Dunbar's descendants. Former adversaries, exhausted by years of conflict, evidently made a decision to cease making enemies of their neighbors and concentrate on what they had in common rather than what drove them apart.\n\nThe story of Moses Dunbar serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of extreme partisanship and the consequences of allowing fear and suspicion to drive a society apart. Yet, it also offers a glimmer of hope, demonstrating how a fractured society can begin to heal its wounds and move forward. The tale of Dunbar's descendants living among their former adversaries is a testament to the human capacity for forgiveness and the desire to escape a divisive past and head into the future.\n\nFeatured image credit: \"Postcard depicting Old Newgate Prison\" by Unknown.

    " Title: Obama Vows to Push for Closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility in Final Two Years\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has reiterated his commitment to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, a promise he made during his 2008 presidential campaign but has yet to fulfill due to opposition in Congress. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Obama expressed his intention to make significant strides towards closing the facility during his final two years in office.\n\n\"I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it,\" Obama said, addressing the issue on CNN's \"State of the Union\" program. He emphasized that the continued operation of the facility \"inspires jihadists and extremists around the world\" and is \"contrary to our values.\"\n\nThe President's comments come after a series of executive actions following the Republican victory in the midterm elections, which gave them control of both houses of Congress. In the aftermath of the election, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. immigration rules, new regulations to curb environmentally-harmful emissions, and a deal to thaw economic relations with Cuba, marking the biggest steps in decades.\n\nThe Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which Obama pledged to shut down during his campaign, has been a challenge due to a law passed by Congress that prohibits the President from closing the facility. In recent months, Obama has transferred many of the detainees housed at the facility to other countries, and he plans to continue this process, as Congress has not allowed him to shift those detainees into federal Supermax facilities within the United States.\n\n\"We are going to continue to place those who have been cleared for release or transfer to host countries that are willing to take them,\" Obama told Crowley. The President acknowledged that dealing with \"some really hard cases\" where \"we know they've done something wrong and are still dangerous\" poses the toughest challenge.\n\nHowever, Obama expressed his desire to shut the facility down, stating, \"I think that it does not make sense for us to spend millions of dollars per individual when we have a way of solving this problem that's more consistent with our values.\"",
    " Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Femininity in Politics: A Reflection on Hillary Clinton's Campaign and the Pressure on Women Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of politics, women leaders often find themselves navigating a challenging landscape, where traditional gender roles and expectations collide with ambition and power. This is a dilemma that has been evident in the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, as highlighted in a recent New York Times column by Maureen Dowd.\n\nThe article, titled \"Hillary Clinton's Gender Trap,\" offers a glimpse into the constant pressure women face to balance their ambition with societal expectations of femininity. Clinton, according to Dowd, has been criticized for being too masculine in her 2008 campaign and too feminine in her 2016 bid.\n\nClinton's 2008 campaign was criticized for her perceived lack of femininity, with Dowd suggesting that she \"campaigned like a man\" and voted for the Iraq War in 2002 to \"project swagger.\" In contrast, her 2016 campaign has been criticized for being too focused on traditionally feminine issues, such as paid leave for new mothers.\n\nThis criticism, as many women can attest, is a reflection of the double standard that women face in the professional world. The pressure to conform to traditional gender roles can be overwhelming, and the consequences of not meeting these expectations can be significant.\n\nFor many women, this pressure manifests as an internal critical voice, a constant reminder of the supposed correct way of doing things that is always just out of reach. This voice is a reminder of the dilemma women face: embrace traditional gender roles and risk being perceived as lacking leadership skills and strength, or embrace ambition and power and risk making people uncomfortable and hostile.\n\nClinton's campaign, however, offers a glimmer of hope. By facing such ridiculously gendered demands and critiques, her campaign is helping to expose the absurdity of these expectations. As more women step into leadership roles, the hope is that these internal critical voices will become less prevalent, and women will be able to focus on their goals and aspirations without the constant pressure to conform to outdated gender norms.\n\nIn the end, the system may still be rigged, but the hope is that by shining a light on these expectations, we can begin to dismantle them and create a more equitable and fair society for all.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Healthcare Subsidies: A Political Chess Game\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's potential decision on the legality of subsidies for health plans on federally facilitated health insurance exchanges is shaping up to be a political chess game, with both parties maneuvering to influence the conservative majority on the court.\n\nIn a recent article for the New York Times, Supreme Court columnist Linda Greenhouse argues that a ruling against the government would go against the conservative justices' established approach to statutory interpretation and their view of how Congress should act towards the states. Greenhouse warns that if the justices proceed to destroy the Affordable Care Act, they will have a great deal of explaining to do, not to her, but to history.\n\nHowever, the conservative justices, who form a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, may not be swayed by Greenhouse's warnings. As she acknowledges, they have their own political history to make, and that is a political one: gutting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while they have the chance.\n\nThe decision likely comes down to Chief Justice John Roberts, who upheld the individual mandate in 2012. Roberts, much to the enmity of his fellow conservative justices, upheld the individual mandate, but only on the grounds of taxation and not the Commerce Clause, as a way to needle the administration. He also gutted Medicaid as a sop to conservatives.\n\nA top concern for Roberts may be the extent to which a ruling against the government in King v. Burwell would send the country's healthcare system into chaos. This should not be a concern for a justice who's deciding on the merits of a case, but it is. And it's a political consideration: his court would more easily get away with an inept ruling if he knew there was a safety net.\n\nIn a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell was repeatedly pressed for details on the administration's backup plan should the court eliminate subsidies for insurance plans bought on federally facilitated exchanges. Burwell repeatedly dodged, saying that her focus now is meeting targets for the open enrollment period.\n\nTwo former Bush HHS officials who spoke with the Hill seem to explain why Burwell and the administration are keeping their plans close to the chest now: because they do not want to signal \"weakness\" to John Roberts.\n\n\"Of course, they have one, they should all resign if they don't,\" said Tom Scully, an HHS official under former President George W. Bush. \"And they certainly should not discuss it either.\" Former HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt, who left office in 2009, agreed. He added that he isn't surprised that senior officials would rather face a day of bad headlines than signal weakness to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe GOP, of course, would love for the administration to signal weakness--all while they, the party that controls both chambers of Congress now, signal strength, comfort, and reassurance. That's why they're putting effort into developing an \"alternative\" to Obamacare after all these years. It's all to show John Roberts: go ahead, guy, we'll take care of everything else. There's no way that any of this should have any bearing on what John Roberts will decide, but it's a reasonable bet that it will, and it makes perfect, cynical sense to appeal to John Roberts this way.",
    " Title: Obama's Visit to Hiroshima Amidst Asian Nuclear Arms Race Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a stop in Hiroshima, is set against a backdrop of growing concerns about a potentially dangerous nuclear future in the region. The visit, scheduled for this Friday, will focus on Hiroshima's dark nuclear past, a stark contrast to recent comments by President-elect Donald Trump suggesting Japan and South Korea might consider developing nuclear arms.\n\nNorth Korea's expansion of its nuclear arsenal and upgrading of ballistic missiles, China's growing and modernizing nuclear stockpile, and the possibility of Japan and South Korea exploring nuclear arms development are major concerns for U.S. and Asian officials. The recent conclusion by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies that North Korea's regime can now mount a small nuclear warhead on missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea has further fueled these fears.\n\nObama's visit to Hiroshima, which was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, is intended to promote a message opposing the spread of nuclear weapons and advocating for a world without them. This aligns with Obama's broader goal of limiting nuclear proliferation, a goal he has pursued with mixed results, including the nuclear deal with Iran and efforts to secure loose nuclear material worldwide. However, he has not achieved significant reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, due in part to Russia's resistance to comparable cuts.\n\nAsia, once thought to be immune to nuclear proliferation, is now seen as a potential atomic danger zone. North Korea's continued pursuit of its weapons program, despite international sanctions, has raised concerns among governments in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Some suspect China is content with a status quo that keeps North Korea contained and stable.\n\nThe issue is particularly sensitive in Japan, which has a post-World War II policy of pacifism enshrined in its constitution. Last year, Japan passed legislation reinterpreting its constitution to allow for foreign military operations, though only for defensive purposes. Some Japanese leaders feel that Obama has not challenged China forcefully enough, and Trump's suggestion that Japan and South Korea might need to fend for themselves has exacerbated these concerns about America's reliability as a protector.\n\n\"Careless American rhetoric that calls into question America's security commitment in general and extended nuclear deterrent in particular fuels Tokyo's security planners to develop hedging strategies,\" said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe anti-nuclear taboo in Japan is also being revisited, especially as China asserts new territorial claims, including over islands and waters claimed by Japan. At the same time, many Japanese leaders feel that Obama has not challenged Beijing forcefully enough. Trump's suggestion that Japan and South Korea might need to fend for themselves has only exacerbated these concerns that America can no longer be relied on for protection.\n\n\"Careless American rhetoric that calls into question America's security commitment in general and extended nuclear deterrent in particular fuels Tokyo's security planners to develop hedging strategies,\" said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nObama himself was dismissive when asked about Trump's comments on allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons, saying they reveal that \"Trump doesn't know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.\"\n\nThe U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea, he added, \"is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region,\" he said, adding that it \"has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation\" in the region.",
    " Title: The Impact of Health Insurance and Adverse Selection on Health Care Consumption and Insurance Markets\n\nArticle:\n\nThe complexities of the health care system, particularly in terms of consumer behavior and insurance markets, have led to the implementation of regulations and mechanisms aimed at ensuring quality and managing costs. The Food and Drug Administration, for instance, oversees the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, akin to the licensing of physicians, dentists, and nurses.\n\nHealth care spending, unlike most other consumer expenditures, can be unpredictable and financially burdensome. Unlike housing, food, or transportation, health care expenses can arise unexpectedly and significantly impact a person's finances.\n\nHealth insurance mitigates this issue by pooling risks among the population, thereby reducing financial uncertainty. However, this system also means that consumers no longer bear the brunt of their health care costs, leading to overconsumption. When insurance covers most health care expenses, individuals may seek medical attention more frequently for minor symptoms or undergo unnecessary tests.\n\nTo counteract this issue, insurers implement copayments, deductibles, and access restrictions. However, these measures reduce the pooling of risks and can create conflicts between insurers and their customers.\n\nAnother problem that arises is adverse selection. If customers differ in relevant ways (such as those with chronic diseases) and these differences are known to them but not to insurers, the mix of people who buy insurance may be more expensive.\n\nAdverse selection can lead to a phenomenon known as the death spiral. In this scenario, if insurance companies charge everyone the same price, it may seem logical to base the price of insurance on the health characteristics of the average person. However, if this is done, the healthiest individuals may decide that insurance is not worth the cost and drop out of the insured pool. With a sicker customer base, the company incurs higher costs and must raise the price of insurance. The higher price then induces the next healthiest group of people to drop insurance, leading to a cycle of rising costs and disappearing insurance markets.\n\nIn conclusion, the health care system faces challenges in managing costs and consumer behavior due to the role of health insurance and the issue of adverse selection. Understanding these complexities is crucial for policymakers and consumers alike as they navigate the health care landscape.",
    " Title: Egypt's Interim President Reverses Decision on ElBaradei as Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's interim President Adly Mansour has reportedly backtracked on the appointment of Mohamed ElBaradei as prime minister, following opposition from the second-largest Islamist party in Egypt, Salfi el-Nour. The initial reports of ElBaradei's appointment were made by news agencies such as Reuters, Al Jazeera, BBC, and Associated Press, citing \"presidential\" and \"opposition\" sources.\n\nElBaradei, a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was expected to be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday afternoon. However, his spokeswoman had informed NPR that the appointment was no longer imminent.\n\nThe news of ElBaradei's appointment followed the ousting of President Mohammed Morsi by the nation's military on Wednesday. Adly Mansour, the chief justice of Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court, was installed as interim president to serve until elections can be held. Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, was in office for just one year before being removed due to widespread protests sparked by economic problems and discontent with his Muslim Brotherhood Party.\n\nElBaradei, who served as special assistant to the Egyptian foreign minister during the historic Camp David peace talks in 1978, has a distinguished career with the United Nations, beginning in 1980. He was sent to Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf war to dismantle Saddam Hussein's nuclear program.\n\nAs the situation in Egypt continues to evolve, we will provide updates as they become available. Our focus remains on news organizations with reporters on the ground and statements from officials with direct knowledge of the events unfolding in Egypt.",
    " Title: Investigating the Origins of the Coronavirus: A Call for Transparency and Truth\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus has sparked numerous theories, with some pointing fingers at China for willfully releasing the virus on the world. However, it is crucial to note that, based on present evidence, there is no definitive proof supporting this claim. Instead, it is more prudent to focus on the role of China's system and its deceptions that exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe coronavirus is believed to have undergone natural selection, undergoing a series of mutations that enabled it to infect and spread among humans. It is possible that the virus evolved in animals or after making the leap to humans. Studies show that the genetic material in the current virus shares an 82% match with the earlier SARS virus, while another type of coronavirus found in bats shares an 89% match. Some early victims had visited a Wuhan seafood market, where live animals were also sold, but a more troubling explanation is that the coronavirus was inadvertently spread from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducted research on bat coronaviruses and possessed a biosafety level 4 facility.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that China deliberately engineered the virus as a weapon, more investigation is necessary. China should be completely transparent about what it finds. After the 2002-2003 SARS disaster, China implemented an infectious disease reporting system that was supposed to be immune from meddling. However, when unusual cases of illness that resembled pneumonia began to accumulate in Wuhan in December, the system failed.\n\nLocal officials attempted to suppress information. When eight doctors in the city expressed concern about the new sickness, they were reprimanded for spreading rumors. One of them, Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, later died of the virus. He had spoken up in an online chat group on Dec. 30. At the time, the Wuhan Health Commission was telling hospitals not to say anything publicly.\n\nIn the critical early weeks of January, as the virus spread, the local and national governments kept the lid on public information. President Xi Jinping was aware of the virus spread on Jan. 7, but he did not warn the public until Jan. 20, seven days after the health commission teleconference. Wuhan was put into lockdown on Jan. 23. China marshaled resources as only an authoritarian regime could. The measures bought time for the rest of the world.\n\nChina shared the whole genome sequence of the virus on Jan. 11, an important contribution toward preparing diagnostic tests. However, China's official death toll seemed far too low considering the size of the population, and anecdotal evidence described many more deaths. On Friday, China revised the Wuhan death toll upward by 50%, to 3,869, based on a reexamination. This is a welcome step, must be done for the whole country, and is precisely the attitude that China needs to embrace\u2014a search for and admission of the truth.\n\nChina has launched a wide-ranging campaign to portray President Xi Jinping as the hero who vanquished the virus. Some Chinese officials have gone so far as to claim that the United States created it, conspiracy talk just as ugly as that heard in Washington. But the part of China's campaign that is most troubling is the claim\u2014now being disseminated widely\u2014that China's authoritarian model should be emulated. This is a dangerous narrative that the United States and China need to cooperate to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath; China is critical in the global supply chain for drugs and personal protective equipment, and is an economic superpower. China and the rest of the world must also confront infectious disease together, not use it to score points. However, no one should conclude that China's authoritarian model is one to be emulated. The model\u2014deception, coverup, and rewriting history\u2014is part of the problem, not the solution.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Unemployment Claims in the U.S. Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Labor reported a new record-breaking weekly total of 28.9 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits, adding to the 22 million who had sought benefits in previous weeks. This surge in jobless claims has overwhelmed state systems for processing claims, and economists estimate the national unemployment rate to be between 15 and 20 percent, significantly higher than during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. The unemployment rate during the Great Depression peaked at about 25 percent.\n\nThe latest jobless claims figure aligns with economists' predictions, which were expected to be substantial but not growing at such a rate. For comparison, 5.2 million people filed unemployment claims for the week ended April 11.\n\nAs the coronavirus spread in the United States earlier this year, many businesses rapidly closed, with hotels, restaurants, and airlines being particularly hard-hit. However, few businesses have remained unaffected by the economic toll. The problems have worsened each week, as more Americans reduced their spending and more businesses cut workers due to the sharp decline in income.\n\nLabor economist Julia Pollak of ZipRecruiter noted that many businesses quickly \"cut to the bone\" when they realized the extent of the pandemic's impact on sales. Now, many of the new layoffs stem from businesses like news organizations and tech companies that weren't directly affected by people staying home but are suffering the consequences of vanishing ad revenue and paid subscriptions.\n\nConsumer spending, the engine behind the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, has evaporated. If they're still operating, many offices are working with skeleton staffs and facing months of dismal revenue.\n\nThe White House and Congress have attempted to intervene, but with limited impact so far. New funding for small businesses in a $2 trillion March emergency spending package quickly dried up in the face of overwhelming demand, prompting the Senate to expand funding by $310 billion on Tuesday. The bill would direct an additional $60 billion to a separate small-business emergency grant and loan program. The House approved the measure 388 to 5 on Thursday afternoon.\n\nEven with all the new government spending, hopes for a sharp economic rebound are fading, overtaken by the public fear of returning to restaurants, movie theaters, schools, and gyms. The growing possibility of a W-shaped recovery\u2014in which a resurgence of the virus or a spike in defaults and bankruptcies triggers another downturn\u2014has analysts reframing what a reopened or rehabilitated economy might look like.\n\nThis year defies historical comparison. In 2020, 28.9 million people have filed for unemployment benefits. Halfway through the fourth month of the year, the figure has already eclipsed the full-year totals of every year but 1982 (30.4 million) and 2009 (29.8 million). At this rate, it will overtake both within a week or so.\n\nLess than half of working-age Americans will be earning a wage next month, said James Knightley, ING Chief International Economist.\n\n\"In an election year, this means that the call for politicians to reopen the economy is only going to get louder, irrespective of the health advice,\" Knightley said.\n\nIn five weeks, 9.4 percent of the working-age population has filed for unemployment insurance, said Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab's director of economic research. That's about twice the share of the population that lost a job during the Great Recession. In some states, such as Michigan, about one in four workers has filed an unemployment claim in the past few weeks.\n\n\"The numbers detailing the shock to the U.S. labor market are so large, and cover such a short time, that your first reaction is that they're a typo,\" Bunker said.\n\nEmployers are also unlikely to be hiring at the same levels they were before the pandemic. As of April 16, job postings on Indeed were down 34 percent compared with last year, Bunker said.\n\nThe job losses, like the epidemic itself, haven't fallen evenly across the country. In three states\u2014Hawaii, Kentucky, and Michigan\u2014about 1 in 4 workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks. In Michigan, plant shutdowns and furloughs have ravaged the manufacturing economy, which had only recently recovered all the jobs it lost in the Great Recession.\n\nOn the opposite side of the ledger sits South Dakota, where Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) has resisted calls to lock down the state's businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Only 6 percent of the state's labor force has applied for unemployment benefits. It may be a regional trend: Neighboring Wyoming and Nebraska, and nearby Utah, also have unusually low claims numbers.\n\nAs part of its sprawling stimulus package, Washington has rolled out relief for millions of households and small businesses struggling to make ends meet. However, money for struggling businesses quickly ran dry, and system glitches have prevented $1,200 stimulus checks from reaching some of the neediest.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill to expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses by $310 billion, and flood a separate small-business emergency grant and loan initiative by an additional $60 billion. Meanwhile, many low-income veterans and Social Security recipients still haven't received the stimulus money in their bank accounts, while other IRS checks are going to dead people. People who didn't file tax returns last year or don't have direct-deposit information may have weeks more to wait.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina Steals the Show in Republican Debate, Trump's Performance Remains Stagnant\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest Republican presidential debate held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the spotlight was stolen by Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, who delivered a commanding performance that has been hailed as a game-changer for her campaign.\n\nFive weeks ago, Fiorina's bravura performance at the first debate in Cleveland catapulted her into the limelight, boosting her poll numbers and securing her a prime-time slot in the debates. On Wednesday in Simi Valley, she continued to impress, demonstrating depth and clarity on defense strategy, and taking a tough stance against Hillary Clinton, her potential Democratic opponent.\n\nFiorina's handling of the Trump face-slap, as she was referred to in the debate, was commendable. She responded gracefully to Trump's comments, implying that voters are intelligent enough to discern his intentions. Trump's attempt to close out that segment by complimenting her appearance was perhaps his flattest moment of the night.\n\nDonald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, showed no growth in his performance, repeating the same vague statements about domestic and foreign policy. Ben Carson, another non-politician in the race, spoke only when spoken to, a stark contrast to other attention-seeking debaters.\n\nJeb Bush showed improvement over his performance in the Cleveland Fox News debate, displaying passion and wit, particularly when he stood up to Trump and defended his brother. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a hot commodity earlier this summer, had another rough night, struggling to regain momentum in the early primary states.\n\nThe debate format has been criticized for favoring Trump, with the non-Donalds receiving close-up moments that are often Trump-related. This has led to a lack of a level playing field for the candidates, with the moderators seemingly trying to keep the large audiences engaged.\n\nTrump's ideas cupboard remains lightly stocked, and his comments about Rand Paul's hair and Columba Bush's heritage have raised concerns. However, Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric and his ability to draw large audiences continue to fuel his campaign.\n\nThe Republican party is expected to face an uncomfortable stretch in the coming months, with debates over government shutdowns, Planned Parenthood funding, and fallout from the Iran deal. This could provide an opportunity for anti-politicians like Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz to gain momentum.\n\nCarly Fiorina's strong performance in the debate has been widely praised, and she was the only candidate who didn't pander to the question about a new face on the $10 bill, instead using the opportunity to call for women to be recognized as equals, not an interest group.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's performance remained stagnant, Carly Fiorina's strong showing in the debate has raised questions about the longevity of Trump Fever. However, with the Republican party facing internal conflicts in the coming months, it remains to be seen whether Trump's anti-politician appeal will continue to resonate with voters.",
    " Title: Trump Acknowledges Regret Over Past Comments, Shifts Tone in Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in his campaign strategy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump acknowledged on Thursday that his past comments may have caused pain and expressed regret for some of his words during a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. The GOP nominee, who has been trailing in the polls, admitted that his comments, which have angered minorities and alienated large segments of the general election electorate, may have been ill-advised.\n\n\"Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you do not choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,\" Trump said, reading from prepared text. \"I have done that, and believe it or not, I regret it\u2014and I do regret it\u2014particularly where it may have caused personal pain.\"\n\nTrump's remarks came as he attempted to rescue a campaign that has struggled since the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from a series of self-created distractions. On Wednesday, Trump announced a campaign shake-up, bringing in a new chief executive and appointing a new campaign manager.\n\nRarely do presidential campaigns wait to advertise or undergo such leadership tumult at such a late stage of the general election. Yet, Trump has struggled to offer voters a consistent message, overshadowing formal policy speeches with a steady stream of self-created controversies.\n\nOne such controversy involved a public feud with an American Muslim family whose son was killed while serving in the U.S. military in Iraq. Trump's decision to tap Stephen Bannon, a combative conservative media executive, as his new campaign chief, suggested that he planned to double down on the playbook he used in the primary, playing to his angry rally crowds and bouncing from one controversy to the next.\n\nHowever, a new Trump emerged on Thursday: a less combative, more inclusive candidate who said he was running to be the \"voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump invested nearly $5 million in battleground state advertising to address daunting challenges in the states that will make or break his White House ambitions. The New York businessman's campaign reserved television ad space over the coming 10 days in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. While Democrat Hillary Clinton has spent more than $75 million on advertising in 10 states since locking up her party's nomination, Trump's new investment marks his first of the general election season.\n\nElection Day is 81 days away, with early voting in the first states set to begin in five weeks. In his remarks, Trump struck a new, inclusive tone and tried to appeal directly to non-white voters, shown by polls to have an overwhelmingly unfavorable view of the candidate.\n\n\"I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream,\" Trump told his audience, again accusing Democratic Hillary Clinton of \"bigotry.\" Clinton, he claimed, \"sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\"\n\nHe urged African-American voters to give him a chance, saying, \"What do you have to lose by trying something new?\" Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, dismissed the speech as just words Trump read from a teleprompter.\n\n\"Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people. He has continued to do so through each of the 428 days from then until now, without shame or regret,\" said spokeswoman Christina Reynolds in a statement. \"We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying, and divisive comments he regrets\u2014and changes his tune altogether.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump's reboot comes too late, and whether he has the discipline to maintain it. Trump now trails Clinton in preference polls of most key battleground states. And his party leaders, even at the Republican National Committee, have already conceded they may divert resources away from the presidential contest in favor of vulnerable Senate and House candidates if things do not improve.\n\nBut Trump supporters largely accepted the change of tone, even if some saw it as unnecessary. \"It takes a lot of strength to say, 'I'm sorry,' to admit\u2014not that he was wrong, but he wished he hadn't done it,\" said Cindy Ammons, 70, a Trump supporter from Spindale, North Carolina.",
    " Title: U.S. Political Landscape Shaken by U.K.'s Decision to Leave EU, Trump and Clinton Respond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Britain's historic vote to leave the European Union, the political landscape in the United States has been shaken, with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton offering their responses to the global event.\n\nPresident Obama, who had advocated for Britain to remain in the union, issued a statement expressing respect for the British people's decision. He emphasized that the U.S.-U.K. relationship will remain strong despite the ongoing negotiations between the two nations.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who was in Scotland touring his golf resorts as the results came in, seized the opportunity to draw parallels between the \"Leave\" campaign and his own presidential bid. Trump suggested that the vote underscores the anger of voters on both sides of the Atlantic towards the status quo.\n\nTrump also criticized Obama for his role in the outcome, stating that his recommendation may have contributed to the vote's failure. Trump's campaign emphasized the parallels between the U.K.'s decision and the potential for similar changes in U.S. trade, immigration, and foreign policies.\n\nClinton, hours later, released a statement echoing Obama's sentiments, expressing respect for the British voters' choice and emphasizing the need for steady leadership in the White House. She also highlighted the economic uncertainty created by the vote and pledged to protect American workers and allies.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average began to tumble in response to the vote, prompting Clinton to emphasize the need to safeguard working families in the U.S. from the potential economic impact.\n\nThe outcome in Britain could potentially trigger a domino effect of similar votes across Europe, testing the cohesion of the Western alliance, and raising questions about Britain's future trade relationship with both the E.U. and the U.S. Obama had previously warned that Britain would be at the \"back of the queue\" in terms of striking a trade deal with the U.S. if it left the union. Trump, however, vowed that, if elected, Britain would always be at the front of the line.\n\nTrump's trip to Europe was not politically motivated, but rather to inspect a pair of championship-level golf resorts he owns in Scotland. Trump spent Friday morning marking the $200 million-plus rehabilitation of the famed Turnberry golf resort, nestled on the rocky coast facing the North Atlantic Ocean.",
    " Title: Trump's Rally in Pennsylvania: A Whirlwind of Taunts, Insults, and 2020 Campaign Preview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly charged and unscripted campaign speech in Moon Township, Pennsylvania on Saturday, President Donald Trump delivered a 73-minute address that was a mix of taunts, insults, and vulgarity, with occasional mentions of the congressional candidate he was there to support, Rick Saccone. The stakes for Tuesday's special election are high for the Republican Party, with Saccone barely ahead of Democratic candidate Conor Lamb in a district that Trump won by 20 points.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome of the election is not just about Republican control of the House; it's also about the potential existential threat to his presidency if Democrats manage to retake the lower chamber, which could lead to impeachment proceedings. \"We have to defeat Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters,\" Trump said, referring to the Democratic leaders. \"You ever see her?... 'We will impeach him.' She's a low-IQ individual. You can't help it. She really is.\"\n\nTrump's speech was largely a platform for himself, with occasional mentions of Saccone, whom he described as \"handsome\" and referred to his opponent as \"Lamb the sham.\" The president also revealed his new slogan for the 2020 campaign: \"Keep America Great!\" He also mentioned his potential 2020 election rivals, stating that he'd \"love to beat Oprah\" and that he knows \"her weakness.\"\n\nForeign policy issues also featured in Trump's speech, with the president raging against Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto for refusing to pay for a border wall and threatening a trade war with the European Union over his tariffs on steel and aluminum. He also reiterated his stance on drug dealers, calling for the death penalty, criticizing sanctuary cities, and advocating for an end to \"chain migration.\"\n\nTrump's speech was not without inaccuracies. He claimed to have received 52 percent of the women's vote, a figure that is only true if all non-white voters are excluded. Exit polls show that Trump won only 25 percent of Hispanic women and just 4 percent of black women.\n\nAs is typical at any Trump rally, the president took time to re-litigate the 2016 election and attack the \"fake\" media. \"Fake as hell CNN. The worst. So fake! Fake news,\" Trump ranted. He also referred to Meet the Press host Chuck Todd as a \"sleeping son of a bitch.\"\n\nThe speech served as a preview of Trump's 2020 campaign, with the president emphasizing his \"Keep America Great\" slogan and expressing his readiness to take on potential rivals like Oprah Winfrey. The stakes are high for both the Republican Party and Trump's presidency, with the special election in Pennsylvania serving as a potential bellwether for the midterm elections in November.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Engage in Political Finance Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) criticized the Koch brothers' political activities, accusing them of attempting to \"buy the country.\" The comments came in response to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) who criticized President Barack Obama's crackdown on politically active tax-exempt organizations, labeling it as a \"war on free speech.\"\n\nMcConnell, in his remarks, compared the administration's proposed rules on these groups to the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) targeting of outside groups and accused Democrats of trying to stifle their election-year critics.\n\nReid countered by labeling the networks backed by David and Charles Koch as political organizations masquerading as social welfare groups. He criticized McConnell's efforts to help these organizations and accused the Republican leader of being an opponent of campaign finance reform.\n\n\"Because of a United States Supreme Court decision called Citizens United, there\u2019s been some really untoward stuff going on in the political world,\" Reid said. \"We have two brothers who are actually trying to buy the country.\"\n\nMcConnell, in response, argued that Democrats are surveying a difficult midterm election cycle and are trying to muzzle groups that back Republican candidates. He claimed that the administration's proposed rules would limit the ability of nonprofit groups organized around \"social welfare\" to engage in political activities.\n\nThe administration's proposed rules would curtail some 501 (c) (4) political activity, according to the Treasury Department. These groups, also called 501 (c) (4) nonprofits after a section of the Tax Code, have become an integral part of the campaign finance landscape in recent years.\n\nReid acknowledged that the Koch-backed groups' spending poses a threat to Democrats, who are fighting to keep the Senate and preserve some control of Congress during Obama's last two years in office.\n\n\"What they\u2019re doing is spending their dollars on governors races, and on the state level and, of course, spending huge amounts of money around the country attempting to defeat Democrats both in the House and the Senate,\" Reid said.\n\nThe Koch brothers, despite being major conservative financiers, have previously given to Democrats, including Senate Democrats. In 2010, they gave nearly $200,000 to Democratic candidates, including a $30,000 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Challenges as Left-Leaning Policies and Abolish ICE Movement Gain Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently grappling with a shift towards more progressive policies that some political analysts argue could be self-destructive. In recent weeks, the party was riding a wave of public outrage over the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border, which was widely perceived as inhumane. However, the party's response to this issue has sparked controversy, with several high-profile senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris, calling for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nThis stance, which has been embraced by some of the party's most liberal members, has been criticized for being easily caricatured as a call for open borders and has provided ammunition for President Trump, who has argued that the abolition of ICE would lead to a country that is unsafe. The rhetoric surrounding this issue has drawn comparisons to Ron Paul's crusade against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) during his campaign against oppressive taxes.\n\nIn addition to the ICE issue, the Democrats have also found themselves on the defensive over their handling of the hounding of Trump administration officials and the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. The party has been criticized for their response to the hounding of officials such as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Stephen Miller, as well as the calls for continued \"harassment\" of Trump Cabinet officials by figures like Maxine Waters. The Democrats have also faced criticism for their stance on blocking any vote on any Trump nominee this year, which has been seen as obstructionist by some.\n\nThe Washington Post noted in a front-page story that the growing liberal agitation over these issues has left Democratic leaders \"scrambling to keep the political outrage they'd counted on to fuel midterm election wins from becoming a liability for the party.\" The paper also warned that Bernie Sanders-style rhetoric, including promises of government-funded jobs, healthcare, and college, could backfire in parts of the country where Trump won in 2016 and where the Democrats will need to win in November to reclaim control of Congress.\n\nThe challenge for the Democratic Party is to balance their progressive ideals with the need to appeal to moderates and independents, particularly in states where they will need to win in order to regain control of Congress. The party's response to the border crisis and the ICE issue, as well as their stance on the Supreme Court vacancy, will be closely watched in the coming months as the midterm elections approach.",
    " Title: Obama Hails Iran Nuclear Deal Progress, Addresses Missile Program and Detainees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in U.S.-Iran relations, President Obama declared Sunday that the just-completed nuclear deal with Iran has made the United States, the region, and the world more secure. The deal, which was finalized after the International Atomic Energy Agency certified Iran's compliance with its agreement to scale back its nuclear program, marks a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nObama's remarks came after a 24-hour period that significantly reshaped U.S. relations with Iran. As part of the deal, the U.S. lifted nuclear-related sanctions, and Iran released five Americans who had been held captive. In a side agreement, the U.S. granted clemency to seven Iranians held in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran also settled a decades-long dispute regarding Iranian assets frozen during the 1979 Tehran hostage crisis. The $400 million in Iranian funds, intended to buy military equipment, were frozen when Muslim students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 hostages. This money, along with $1.3 billion in interest, has been returned to settle claims at the Iran\u2013United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague. U.S. citizens had already recovered $2.5 billion in claims against Iran through the same tribunal, the State Department said.\n\nHowever, Obama also addressed Iran's \"destabilizing behavior elsewhere\" and its ballistic missile program. He stated that the U.S. would continue to enforce sanctions vigorously and remain vigilant about Iran's ballistic missile program. The Treasury Department announced it was imposing sanctions on 11 people and companies involved in Iran's ballistic missile program.\n\nObama had initially planned to speak Saturday night, but waited until all the Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were able to leave Tehran. Two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the exchange, said two issues held up the plane's departure: The crew needed enough rest before the long flight to Switzerland, and they wanted to make sure that Rezaian's wife and mother were also on the plane.\n\nWhile Obama spoke to reporters in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Republican presidential candidates condemned the deal on Sunday morning television. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Fox News Sunday, said, \"Barack Obama is in the 'Let's-Make-A-Deal' business.\" Cruz, among others, criticized the deal as a dangerous move that endangers U.S. safety and security.",
    " Title: Understanding the Keystone XL Oil Pipeline: A Comprehensive Guide to the Contentious Project\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding energy infrastructure, the Keystone XL pipeline stands as a significant point of contention. The Senate's decision to vote against its completion has left a fraction of the project, approximately 1,200 miles long, in limbo. This article aims to provide a neutral, factual overview of the Keystone XL pipeline, its implications, and the ongoing debate.\n\nCurrently, the Keystone XL pipeline, which stretches from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico, is at the center of a years-long dispute among politicians, energy companies, and environmentalists. The pipeline, if completed, would transport up to 830,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nAs of now, about 40% of the total project has been built, with oil flowing through two segments: a 298-mile stretch from Steele City, Nebraska, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and a 485-mile segment between Cushing and Nederland, Texas. The remaining segment, if approved, would run between Alberta and Steele City.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline's construction phase is estimated to create about 42,000 direct and indirect jobs and generate approximately $2 billion in earnings in the U.S. However, once construction is finished in about two years, the pipeline would create only about 50 new permanent jobs.\n\nThe political challenge for President Obama is that Democrats are divided on the issue, with construction unions favoring the project and some environmental activists opposing it. The president has guarded the power to issue a \"presidential permit\" for the pipeline, which is necessary because it crosses the U.S.-Canada border.\n\nThe State Department was required to conduct an environmental assessment of the final, proposed leg of the pipeline due to its border crossing. The basic environmental review was completed in January, concluding that the pipeline would have \"little impact\" on the price consumers pay for gasoline in the U.S. However, the review also stated that blocking the pipeline would reduce income for tar sands developers, but not enough to curtail most oil sands growth plans or to shut-in existing production.\n\nA legal challenge in Nebraska could affect the pipeline's route. The Nebraska Supreme Court is currently considering whether the governor had the authority to approve the new route, with justices expected to announce their ruling in coming months.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline is just one of several pipelines transporting oil sands crude, but it is noteworthy due to its size and the ongoing debate it has sparked. The pipeline's future remains uncertain, with the Senate's decision to vote against its completion adding another layer to the ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Trump Aims for New Hampshire Victory as Primary Elections Heat Up\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of his campaign in New Hampshire, businessman Donald Trump, the current frontrunner in the Republican presidential primaries, urged voters to solidify his chances of winning his first primary victory. With six months of leading in polls in New Hampshire and still hovering around the 30 percent mark, Trump is the odds-on favorite, and a victory would provide a much-needed rebound after a less-than-impressive showing in Iowa's caucuses.\n\nTrump received a hero's welcome Monday night at the Verizon Wireless arena in downtown Manchester, where thousands braved a storm to attend the rally. The crowd roared as Trump walked onto the stage to the Beatles song \"Revolution.\"\n\n\"This is now crunch time,\" Trump said. \"We have a movement going that is incredible.\" He continued, \"Tomorrow, you have to get out and you have to vote no matter what. You've got to get out to vote.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans and independents, who are allowed to vote in the GOP primary, are expected to help narrow the Republican field. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina and three current or former governors each need a strong showing to remain viable.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who placed a surprising third in Iowa, is hoping to regain his momentum after a rough debate performance on Saturday. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is hoping to maintain his first-place finish in Iowa without falling too far behind.\n\nThe race moves next to South Carolina, where Trump also leads in the polls, then to Nevada, and then to Super Tuesday on March 1, when numerous delegates to the nominating convention are at stake. This showdown has been labeled the SEC primary because many of the battles are in states that make up the collegiate Southeastern Conference.\n\nTrump, along with the rest of the field, has been campaigning tirelessly in New Hampshire, targeting the large number of undecided voters who pollsters say will decide the race.\n\nSen. Rubio, aiming to regain his Iowa momentum, vowed to build the kind of coalition\u2014including conservatives and establishment Republicans\u2014that will be needed to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against me,\" he said at a rally in Nashua. \"I can't wait to run against her.\"\n\nRubio's debate stumble has energized the three governors\u2014John Kasich of Ohio, Chris Christie of New Jersey, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2014who are competing to consolidate the support of donors and voters looking for an alternative to Trump and Cruz.\n\nJohn Kasich, at his 105th town hall meeting, said his appeal goes beyond the Republican Party to include blue-collar Democrats who helped power Ronald Reagan's winning campaigns.\n\n\"Here's what it gets down to in politics: It's the head and the heart,\" Mr. Kasich said. \"It's the vision thing. If you have the vision and you can get people to understand what the vision is, and you can communicate to them that you understand their problems, that's how you win elections. It's not all about dirt and negative campaigning.\"\n\nJeb Bush continued to trade verbal barbs with Trump, telling a crowd at a local Rotary Club in Nashua that the billionaire businessman's campaign is based on insulting women, castigating Hispanics, and ridiculing disabled people.\n\n\"I think we need a president that actually believes in the American people that won't push everybody down to make themselves look good,\" Mr. Bush said.\n\nThree candidates dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucuses, and the primary in New Hampshire is likely to eliminate more. Political analysts say it will be challenging for Bush, Kasich, Christie, and Fiorina to survive disappointing showings. Mrs. Fiorina also will be tested after a weak showing in Iowa and no favorable states on the horizon.\n\nSpeaking in Hudson, Mr. Christie downplayed polls that showed him struggling in the mid-single digits, saying they were taken before Saturday's debate. He said that affair proved to voters that Mr. Rubio can't carry himself.\n\n\"When the lights get that bright, you either shine or you melt,\" Mr. Christie said. \"We can not afford to have a president who melts.\"\n\nHistory suggests that the stakes are high in New Hampshire. Since 1976, the eventual Republican nominee has won in either Iowa or New Hampshire.\n\nTrump faces lingering questions about whether he can turn his strong polling into victories after he led surveys in Iowa but finished second. However, Trump has since argued that his showing is more impressive than the pundits think\u2014given that he is a political newcomer, the caucus process is \"weird\" and \"complex,\" and there are questions about whether the Cruz camp hurt his chances with some campaign shenanigans.\n\n\"So, let's say I came in first or second because I don't forget things like that,\" Mr. Trump said Monday on MSNBC. \"I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\"",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus 2016: A Crucial Test for Republican and Democratic Contenders\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the long-awaited Iowa caucuses approach, the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are gearing up for a critical test that could provide much-needed clarity in the nominating contests. The caucuses will take place on Monday, and the number of voters who participate could significantly impact the outcome.\n\nVoting in a caucus is more complex than in a primary, as Iowans must show up at their designated caucus site at a specific time and, in some cases, stay for several hours. Most analysts and campaign operatives agree that a high turnout benefits the two outsiders, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, while a lower turnout favors Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. Both Trump and Sanders have been working to expand the pool of Iowa voters by reaching out to first-time caucus-goers.\n\nTrump has a strong following among non-college-educated, white, working-class voters, while Sanders has been targeting young voters. Both men lead by double digits among those who say they will be participating in their first caucus. However, the question remains as to how many of these first-time Trump and Sanders voters will actually show up.\n\nThe previous record for Republican turnout in Iowa was 122,000 votes in 2012. If Trump manages to bring in the people who wait for hours to attend his rallies to the caucus sites on Monday night, that number could be significantly higher, potentially reaching 150,000.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama shattered all Iowa records and helped Iowa Democratic turnout reach 240,000. While no one is expecting a turnout of that magnitude this year, Bernie Sanders needs the number to be above the 124,000 who turned out in 2004.\n\nThe weather could also impact turnout, as a winter storm is predicted to start on Tuesday, and it could hit parts of Iowa on Monday night, potentially depressing turnout.\n\nThe state is well-suited to Ted Cruz, with a large number of conservative evangelical voters. Cruz needs to win Iowa if he is to have a viable path to the nomination. If Cruz finishes second to Trump, his road to the nomination will be much more challenging. Cruz has been telling his supporters that if Trump wins Iowa, he will be unstoppable, as Trump does not need to win Iowa to secure the nomination but would have significant momentum. Trump currently leads in all early states, including New Hampshire, where he has a 2-to-1 lead in polls.\n\nMarco Rubio has a 3-2-1 strategy: come in third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and then win somewhere. Rubio needs a strong third-place finish in Iowa to convince his donors that he has a clear path to the nomination. The Republican establishment would like to rally behind Rubio as an alternative to Trump or Cruz, but they have been hesitant to do so. A stronger-than-expected finish in Iowa would help Rubio consolidate the mainstream wing of the GOP.\n\nIf Rubio manages to surpass Cruz and finish second in Iowa, he will be well-positioned to finish second to Trump in New Hampshire and become the clear establishment alternative.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the question is whether Bernie Sanders has the organization to upset Hillary Clinton. Clinton, who was stung by her third-place finish eight years ago, has built a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. However, organization alone is not enough without enthusiasm. Sanders has excited Democrats with his calls to break up the big banks and make college and health care free.\n\nSanders started organizing late in Iowa, and, like Cruz, he needs to win Iowa. If Sanders beats Clinton in Iowa, it would be an upset, and he would head into New Hampshire with even more momentum. He already has a significant lead there, as neighboring-state candidates usually do (Sanders is from Vermont). A win in both Iowa and New Hampshire for Sanders could change the dynamic in the South, where Clinton has built a firewall based on her support among African-American Democrats.\n\nUnlike the Republican caucuses, Democrats report delegate totals, not vote totals. Delegates are awarded through a formula based on how candidates do in precincts all over the state. Sanders could be at a disadvantage here because his support has been heavily concentrated in college towns and urban areas, although the Sanders campaign has been trying to expand its reach to rural areas. Clinton's team is filled with Obama field-operation veterans who have built an organization for Clinton that reaches all of Iowa's 99 counties and 1,683 precincts.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iowa caucuses will provide valuable insights into the Republican and Democratic nominating contests. The number of voters who participate, the weather, and the organization and enthusiasm of the candidates will all play a role in determining the winners. The results could set the stage for the upcoming primaries and caucuses and potentially change the dynamic in the South for the Democrats.",
    " Title: Illinois Resident with Concealed Carry Permit Stops Armed Robbery Suspect, Contributing to Decline in Crime Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an incident that took place last month, an 86-year-old Illinois resident, whose identity remains undisclosed, successfully intervened in an armed robbery, using his concealed carry weapon to apprehend the suspect. This event occurred at an AT&T store outside Chicago, where the man, a holder of a concealed carry permit, prevented others from entering the store during the holdup.\n\nAccording to police department statistics, the number of robberies resulting in arrests in Chicago has decreased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year. Reports of burglary and motor vehicle theft have also seen a 20 percent and 26 percent decline, respectively. In the first quarter, the city's homicide rate reached a 56-year low.\n\nRichard Pearson, the executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, attributes this decrease in crime rates to the implementation of concealed carry permits. \"It isn't any coincidence that crime rates started to go down when concealed carry was permitted,\" Pearson said. \"The criminals don't know who's armed and who isn't, which has a deterrence effect.\"\n\nAs of July 29, the state had 83,183 applications for concealed carry permits, with 68,549 licenses issued. By the end of the year, Pearson estimates that 100,000 Illinois citizens will be carrying concealed weapons. When Illinois began processing requests in January, gun training and shooting classes\u2014required for the application\u2014were filling up before the rifle association was able to schedule them, according to Pearson.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department has credited better police work as a reason for the lower crime rates this year. Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy noted the confiscation of more than 1,300 illegal guns in the first three months of the year, better police training, and \"intelligent policing strategies.\"\n\nThe Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment from The \u2588\u2588\u2588. However, the impact of concealed carry cannot be dismissed. Instead of creating more crimes, as many gun control advocates warn, increased concealed carry rates have coincided with lower rates of crime.\n\nA July study by the Crime Prevention Research Center found that 11.1 million Americans have permits to carry concealed weapons, a 147 percent increase from 4.5 million seven years ago. Meanwhile, homicide and other violent crime rates have dropped by 22 percent.\n\nJohn Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center based in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, stated, \"There's a lot of academic research that's been done on this, and if you look at the peer-reviewed studies, the bottom line is a large majority find a benefit of concealed carry on crime rates\u2014and, at worst, there's no cost.\"\n\nWithin Illinois, Cook County, which encompasses Chicago, has the state's largest number of concealed carry applications, with 28,552 requests, according to the county's website. Accounting for population, however, less than 1 percent are carrying. Mason County has the top per-capita rate in Illinois, with 14 percent of its residents holding concealed carry licenses, followed by Shelby County, with 9 percent.\n\nSheriff Miller of Shelby County, located in southwestern Illinois, about an hour and 45 minutes driving time from St. Louis, attributes the low crime rate in his county to domestic-related charges and a lack of serious violent crime. He doesn't anticipate concealed carry to significantly impact the statistics.\n\nFrom a national perspective, Florida has the most active concealed carry permits, at nearly 1.3 million. Texas is second, with just over 708,000. Hawaii, at 183, has the fewest of states whose data were available. At 300,000 concealed carry licenses, Illinois would compare with Virginia, which has 363,274, and Alabama, with 379,917.",
    " Title: President Trump Cancels Denmark Visit Over Greenland Purchase Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Donald Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday, citing Frederiksen's dismissal of the idea of the U.S. buying Greenland as \"absurd.\" The visit, initially scheduled for September 2-3, was part of Trump's trip to Europe, but there were no solid indications that the visit was centered on the potential purchase of Greenland until Trump's tweets on Tuesday.\n\nTrump announced the cancellation in a series of tweets, stating, \"Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time.\" He added, \"The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct.\"\n\nThe White House later confirmed that the entire trip to Denmark, including a planned meeting with the Queen of Denmark, had been scrapped. The sudden cancellation took many by surprise, with commentators expressing their shock and amusement. Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim tweeted, \"Breaking my vacation Twitter hiatus to say that I am amazed the purpose of the Denmark trip was actually to purchase Greenland.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported last week that Trump was interested in buying Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory under Danish control with a population of approximately 56,000. According to the paper, Trump had discussed the idea during \"meetings, dinners, and passing conversations\" due to Greenland's \"abundant resources and geopolitical importance.\"\n\nThe U.S. made a similar attempt to buy Greenland in 1947, albeit without the modern-day fanfare of social media. The idea prompted mockery from some left-wing commentators, but most found humor in the situation. In a fourth-wall-breaking moment, even Trump himself seemed to join in, tweeting a meme on Monday that depicted a Trump skyscraper looming over a mostly empty village in Greenland.\n\nHowever, Greenland is not for sale, according to Frederiksen. \"Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant,\" Frederiksen told reporters during a trip to meet Kim Kielsen, the premier of Greenland, on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump compared the proposal to \"a large real estate deal.\" He stated, \"A lot of things can be done. It\u2019s hurting Denmark very badly because they're losing almost $700 million a year carrying it [Greenland]. So, they carry it at great loss, and strategically for the United States, it would be nice. And, we're a big ally of Denmark and we help Denmark.\"\n\nDespite Trump's comments, buying Greenland was not a top priority for him or his administration, he added.",
    " Title: The Invaluable Contribution of Women Judges: A Perspective from Leah Ward Sears, Former Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court\n\n(CNN) - In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg expressed her intention to serve on the bench for at least five more years, aiming to remain active until she turns 90. This decision has sparked a renewed discussion on the unique value women bring to the judiciary. As a woman who served as a jurist on the Georgia Supreme Court, including as its chief justice, Leah Ward Sears shares her perspective on the significance of women judges in shaping a fair and just jurisprudence in the United States.\n\nFor decades, the debate has raged over the impact of women on the highest courts. As a seasoned jurist, Sears affirms that the presence of women, such as Justice Ginsburg, has been instrumental in dismantling the entrenched gender biases that have historically permeated the judicial system.\n\nIn her tenure, Justices like Ginsburg have not only exposed the hidden gender biases of their times but have also worked to address and rectify these issues. One notable example is her majority opinion in United States v. Virginia (1996), where she championed the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to challenge the gender-exclusive admissions policy of the Virginia Military Academy.\n\nIn her ruling, Ginsburg wrote, \"Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women... Generalizations about 'the way women are,' estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description.\"\n\nAnother significant case was Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), in which Ginsburg's concurring opinion struck down a Texas bill restricting access to abortion. She emphasized the potential dangers women face when access to safe and legal procedures is limited, stating, \"When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners... at great risk to their health and safety.\"\n\nWomen's perspectives, shaped by their unique experiences, can enrich the judicial process. By bringing a nuanced understanding of the challenges women face, such as discrimination and the burdens of child and elder care, female judges can contribute to more informed and empathetic decision-making.\n\nMoreover, the presence of women in the judiciary serves as a powerful inspiration for young women, encouraging them to pursue careers in law and the judiciary. By making courtrooms more welcoming environments for women, these judges also help create a more inclusive legal profession.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's impressive judicial record and her advocacy for women's rights and human rights make her an invaluable asset to the judiciary. As she continues to serve, her wisdom and expertise will undoubtedly shape the legal landscape for years to come."
